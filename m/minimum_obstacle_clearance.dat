50|$|Pilots {{should be}} aware that there are {{significant}} differences in obstacle clearance criteria between procedures designed in accordance with ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS. This is especially true in respect of circling approaches where the assumed radius of turn and <b>minimum</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> are markedly different.|$|E
50|$|Similar to an {{obstacle}} limitation surface (OLS), the PANS-OPS protection surfaces are imaginary surfaces in space that guarantee an aircraft a certain <b>minimum</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance.</b> These surfaces {{may be used}} as a tool for local governments in assessing building development. Where buildings may (under certain circumstances) be permitted to penetrate the OLS, they cannot be permitted to penetrate any PANS-OPS surface, because the purpose of these surfaces is to guarantee pilots operating under IMC {{an obstacle}} free descent path for a given approach.|$|E
5000|$|These {{approaches}} {{include both}} ground-based and satellite-based systems and include criteria for terminal areas (TAAs), basic approach criteria, and final approach criteria. The TAA is {{a transition from}} the en route structure to the terminal environment which provides <b>minimum</b> altitudes for <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance.</b> The TAA is a [...] "T" [...] or [...] "basic T" [...] design with left and right base leg IAFs on initial approach segments perpendicular to the intermediate approach segment {{where there is a}} dual purpose IF/IAF for a straight-in procedure (no procedure turn NoPT), or hold-in-lieu-of procedure-turn (HILO) course reversal. The base leg IAFs is 3 to 6 NM from the IF/IAF. The basic-T is aligned with the runway centerline, with the IF 5 NM from the FAF, and the FAF is 5 NM from the threshold.|$|R

50|$|On 7 May 2005 a Transair-operated Fairchild Metro III {{operating}} an Aero Tropics service (Flight 675 from Bamaga) {{was carrying}} out {{an approach to}} Lockhart River aerodrome in Queensland, when it hit the 1,300 ft Pap Ridge 90 ft below its highest point in low cloud and squally rain. The two crew and thirteen passengers died in the accident, in what as of November 2008 is the worst airline accident in Australia for forty years. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau initial factual report states the aircraft's power settings at impact appeared normal for an approach, but that the aircraft was about 1,000 ft below the <b>minimum</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> height for that position.|$|E
50|$|For example, see the {{illustration}} above. In this case, {{a segment of}} an airway ending at fix ABC has a MEA of 5200 feet MSL, and the <b>minimum</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> altitude (MOCA) required to clear an obstacle six nautical miles from the fix within the next segment is 6620 feet MSL. The total increase in altitude from 5200 feet to 6620 feet over that distance is 1420 feet. At a normal rate of climb (120 feet per nautical mile at this altitude), the maximum altitude that can be gained over that distance is 720 feet, which is 700 feet below the required MOCA. Thus, a MCA for fix ABC of 5900 feet MSL (700 feet above the MEA of the previous segment) will be published for fix ABC for traffic continuing into the airway segment concerned from that fix.|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{precision}} {{approaches of}} aircraft to airports with vertical and lateral guidance are only conducted as straight in approaches {{with a single}} glide path, mostly using VHF radio navigation technology. Here, the final approach track is usually several kilometers long (10 nautical miles) and cannot be changed due to the linear propagation of radio signals. Using the technology of augmented Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) this final approach path can be made more flexible with several curved and straight segments with different vertical profiles in order to enable a safe descent with vertical guidance also in mountainous terrain, around obstacles or for noise abatement. Currently, a special type of laterally guided curved approaches is already implemented in very few places. This type of approach procedure is called Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required and is usually only available for specially approved operators. Here, the lateral guidance during the approach is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems and the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to non-precision approach procedures (no vertical guidance) and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, {{the accuracy of the}} barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision approach procedures, temperature dependent and requires the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved approach procedures should rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. When augmentation systems provide additional accuracy and integrity improvements, a vertical component of the position can be computed. Together with a predefined path, this highly accurate position solution can enable curved approaches with a vertical glide path guidance down to the required <b>minimum</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> (200 ft above ground). Using a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) at the airport, one or more Terminal Area Paths (TAP) could be broadcast to provide precision guidance to aircraft maneuvering in the terminal area. Such a use of the system would allow the provision of multiple curved approaches to multiple runway ends with only one ground installation and as such save cost to the airport and airline operator whilst providing the added benefit of noise abatement and enhanced obstacle clearance. The transmission of multiple curved or segmented steep approaches enables approaching aircraft to select the approach path most suitable for the given situation. An experimental GBAS station was installed at the research airport in Braunschweig. Data processing complied with the currently proposed requirements to support automatic landings. Corrections for GPS measurements and integrity parameters were sent to a research aircraft which was equipped with an experimental GPS receiver providing raw measurement data. The received data and measurements were then processed on board in real-time and provide approach guidance information to the experimental pilot in form of a flight director indication. To evaluate system performance the authors create a truth reference track from a post processed carrier phase solution. Finally, the GBAS outputs and the received ILS signals are compared to the truth reference. The system performed well within all specifications and showed full availability at all times during the flight. Compared to ILS, GBAS is significantly more precise and shows almost no nois...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. Obstacle {{crossing}} is compromised following stroke. The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantify modifications during <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> following stroke. Subjects. Twelve subjects with stroke and 12 subjects without stroke participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic variables were measured while participants crossed a 4 -cm-high obstacle. Subjects with stroke walked at a self-selected speed; subjects without stroke walked at a comparable speed and at a self-selected speed. Results. Several modifications were observed following stroke with both groups walking at self-selected speeds. The affected lead limb was positioned closer to the obstacle before crossing. Affected trail-limb <b>clearance</b> over the <b>obstacle</b> was reduced. Both affected and unaffected lead and trail limbs landed closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after <b>clearance.</b> Swing time was increased in the affected lead limb after <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance.</b> Fewer modifications were detected at matched walking speed; the trail limb still landed closer to the obstacle. Discussion and Conclusion. Modifications during obstacle crossing following stroke may be partly related to walking speed. The findings raise issues of safety because people with stroke demonstrated reduced clearance of a 4 -cm obstacle and limb placement closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after <b>clearance.</b> [Said CM, Goldie PA, Culham E, et al.

40|$|Abstract — Motion {{planning}} {{is a difficult}} and widely studied problem in robotics. Current research aims not only to find feasible paths, but to ensure paths have certain properties, e. g., shortest or safest paths. This is difficult for current stateof-the-art sampling-based techniques as they typically focus on simply finding any path. Despite this difficulty, samplingbased techniques have shown great success in planning {{for a wide range}} of applications. Among such planners, Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) search the planning space by biasing exploration toward unexplored regions. This paper introduces a novel RRT variant, Medial Axis RRT (MARRT), which biases tree exploration to the medial axis of free space by pushing all configurations from expansion steps towards the medial axis. We prove that this biasing increases the tree’s <b>clearance</b> from <b>obstacles.</b> Improving <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> is useful where path safety is important, e. g., path planning for robots performing tasks in close proximity to the elderly. Finally, we experimentally analyze MARRT, emphasizing its ability to effectively map difficult passages while increasing <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance,</b> and compare it to contemporary RRT techniques.
