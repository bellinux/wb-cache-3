When both channels are displayed, {{the type of}} channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting.

25|$|The microMIPS32/64 {{architectures}} are supersets of the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures (respectively) {{designed to}} replace the MIPS16e ASE. A disadvantage of MIPS16e is that it requires a <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> before any of its 16-bit instructions can be processed. microMIPS adds versions of the most-frequently used 32-bit instructions that are encoded as 16-bit instructions. This allows programs to intermix 16- and 32-bit instructions without having to switch modes. microMIPS was introduced alongside of MIPS32/64 Release 3, and each subsequent release of MIPS32/64 has a corresponding microMIPS32/64 version. A processor may implement microMIPS32/64 or both microMIPS32/64 and its corresponding MIPS32/64 subset. Starting with MIPS32/64 Release 6, support for MIPS16e ended, and microMIPS is the only form of code compression in MIPS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} Rosetta’s reduced {{compatibility}} compared to Apple’s earlier 68k emulator for PPCs lies within its implementation: Rosetta is a user-level program {{and can only}} intercept and emulate user-level code, while the older emulator was integrated with the system {{at a much lower}} level. The 68k emulator was given access to the very lowest levels of the OS by being at the same level as, and tightly connected to, the Mac OS nanokernel on PPC Macs (later used for multiprocessing under Mac OS 8.6 and later), which means that the nanokernel was able to intercept PowerPC interrupts, translate them to 68k interrupts (then doing a mixed <b>mode</b> <b>switch,</b> if necessary), and then executing 68k code to handle the interrupts. This allowed lines of 68k and PPC code to be interspersed within the same binary of a fat application. While a similar effect could likely have been achieved for Mac OS X by running Rosetta within XNU, Apple instead chose to implement Rosetta as a user-level process to avoid excessive debugging and the potential for security issues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{adaptive}} reconfigurable {{flight control}} system using the <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> of multiple models is studied. The conventional <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> method may not guarantee the stability {{and the performance of}} the system. In this study, modified adaptive <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> and decision logic are proposed to improve the adaptiveness of the transient dynamics of a system while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system in the overall flight envelope. Fixed parameter models and adaptive models are used for <b>mode</b> <b>switching,</b> and a re-initialized adaptive model is also considered. Proper fixed system models are determined by considering various flight conditions with possible aircraft fault models. The <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> control system is designed based on the selected models for reconfiguration. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Applying the derived optimal transmit power and bandwidth, <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> is addressed then to choose the optimal mode. An ergodic capacity-based <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm is proposed. We derive the accurate close-form capacity approximation for each mode under imperfect CSIT at first and calculate the optimal BPJ-EE of each mode based on the approximation.

A <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> system {{can be viewed as a}} collection of continuous models together with rules for switching between them. An intuitive picture is an automaton with continuous models in the vertices and switching rules as transitions. When simulating a physically modeled <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> system, the state space may change size when changing modes.

30|$|Adapting the routing {{behavior}} {{to the network}} context has to happen with minimal impact on the ongoing network traffic. This is a challenging aspect, since changing from one mode to another has its implications, {{not only for the}} node that changes its mode, but also for all the other nodes for which this mode change involves updates in their routing table. This means that {{in order to keep the}} routing tables consistent and to maintain mode compatibility, appropriate actions need to be taken. As all <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> can occur, the protocol should be able to deal with them. This section describes the desired protocol behavior upon <b>mode</b> <b>switches.</b> This behavior has been verified through simulations in GloMoSim and guarantees that during <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> connectivity between applications is maintained. As all <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> involve transitions from or to a proactive mode, between proactive modes or changes within a proactive mode, we have chosen to manage these <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> through the propagation of special proactive update entries.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presented}} a transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy for D 2 D communication underlaying cellular networks in both single-cell and multi-cell scenarios. We first introduced three communication transmission modes {{in these two}} scenarios, which are the traditional cellular communication mode, direct D 2 D communication mode, and two-way DF-relayed D 2 D communication mode. By deriving the expression for the ergodic achievable sum-rate of these transmission modes, we got the threshold of different transmission modes to attain maximum sum-rate of the system. Based on this, we got the transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy theoretically. Simulation results showed that by applying the transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy, the ergodic achievable sum-rate of the system achieves a remarkable enhancement under different interference level and distance of D 2 D users. The proposed transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy could be an effective method for efficient D 2 D communication.|$|R

30|$|In this article, we {{proposed}} a dynamic rate-adaptive MIMO <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> scheme between spatial multiplexing and diversity modes.

30|$|The above {{procedure}} {{is based on}} the instant CSIT. As we know, there are two main schemes to choose the optimal mode in the spectral efficient multimode transmission systems. The one {{is based on the}} instant CSIT [12 – 14], while the other is based on the ergodic capacity [15 – 17]. The ergodic capacity-based <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> can be performed off-line and can provide more guidance on the preferred mode under given scenarios. If applying the ergodic capacity of each mode in the energy-efficient <b>mode</b> <b>switching,</b> similar benefits can be exploited. The next subsection will present the approximation of ergodic capacity and propose the ergodic capacity-based <b>mode</b> <b>switching.</b>|$|R

30|$|From Figures 10 and 11, we can {{conclude}} that significant energy saving can be further acquired when adaptive <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> between SIMO and MIMO is applied. However, adaptive <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> may be dificult due to some practical reasons. First, when SIMO mode is configured, parameters like PCI and CQI for the second stream are not available because the second antenna is switched off to save energy. Thus, how to estimate the available EE for D-TxAA is a challenge. Second, the transmit antenna number information should be informed through the system information, so the <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> will impact all users in the cell and bring huge signaling overhead. To sum up, the protocol {{may need to be}} redesigned to utilize the potential EE improvement with <b>mode</b> <b>switching.</b> Nevertheless, the Node B can decide the active antenna number according to the load of the systems, which should be realized in the network level and {{is beyond the scope of}} this article.|$|R
40|$|Physical system {{modeling}} {{benefits from}} the use of implicit equations because it is often an intuitive way to describe physical constraints and behaviors. To achieve efficient models, model abstraction may lead to idealized component behavior that <b>switches</b> between <b>modes</b> of operation (e. g., an electrical diode may be on or off) based on inequalities (e. g., voltage > 0). In an explicit representation, the combination of these local <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> leads to a combinatorial explosion of the number of global modes. It is shown how an implicit formulation can be used to formulate these <b>mode</b> <b>switches,</b> thereby circumventing the combinatorial problem. This leads to the use of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) for each of the modes. In case these DAEs are of high index, jumps in generalized state variables may occur. In combination with the inequalities that define <b>mode</b> <b>switching,</b> this leads to rich and complex mode transition behavior.
