In 2005-2007 these four companies {{carried out a}} successfully completed research and technological development project “Lasers for <b>microprocessing</b> and diagnostics” partially financed from EU Structural Funds. The purpose {{of the project was}} to develop a new type of laser meeting the requirements for industrial applications. Light Conversion and EKSPLA did the research work for development of high repetition rate, short pulse, high medium power diode-pumped lasers and investigated harmonic generation, and tunable optical parametric radiation. Such sources of radiation are supposed to be used in <b>microprocessing.</b> as well as other applications.|$|E
5000|$|Robert (Bob) Herman Cushman (16 January 1924 in Evanston, Illinois - 27 January 1996 in Essex, Connecticut) was an American trade {{magazine}} journalist {{who had written}} extensively across several engineering disciplines, two in particular during the vanguard of rapid technological advances and ensuing market boom of their respective technologies. In the late 1950s, {{at the beginning of}} the Space Race, Cushman had been an editor at Aviation Week & Space Technology. [...] From 1962 to the late-1980s, he was an editor for Electronic Design News. He started out at EDN as the East Coast editor and soon rose to Special Features Editor covering <b>microprocessing.</b> Cushman was widely known within the <b>microprocessing</b> industry for his influential writings in Electronic Design News about microprocessors during its infancy in the early 1970s, through its period of rapid growth and development in the 1980s. His articles, collectively, chronicle the birth and early milestones of microprocessors and, at the time, helped bridge technical development with applications. Citations of his work are prevalent in documents produced by academicians, engineers, the military, and NASA.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, Pierre Delval {{moved to}} a {{different}} environment once again, this time developing a piece of private international engineering dedicated {{to the protection of}} fiduciary currencies and identity documents against forgeries affecting the State or involving organised crime. His project was an international first: combining fiduciary security traditions with <b>microprocessing</b> procedures on the world’s first identity and voter registration smart card, on behalf of the Paraguayan State. Several other similar projects immediately followed in East Africa and in the Gulf.In January 1994, Pierre Delval was appointed by the Iraqi Government to examine the possibility of creating a national official government printing works, capable of halting the wave of forgeries affecting the State in provenance from Asia Minor. Iraq was under international embargo and certain States were attempting to destabilise the Ba'athist economy, which had already been weakened by the long war against Iran and the recent UN economic blockade. Pierre Delval thus spent seven years working in relation with Europe, Iraq and the UN, trying to find the technical, financial and political solutions necessary for putting an arsenal of anti-forgery measures in place in Baghdad, while respecting the conditions set by the UN Security Council.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} model behind the electric utility {{has changed over}} the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK’s National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought New England’s electric system for $3.2 billion. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; solar engineering and photovoltaic systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with <b>microprocessing</b> which aids in monitoring and dispatching.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of mammalian microRNA (miRNA) genes reside within introns of protein-encoding and non-coding genes, yet the mechanisms coordinating primary transcript processing into both mature miRNA and spliced mRNA are poorly understood. Analysis of melanoma invasion suppressor miR- 211 expressed from intron 6 of melastatin revealed that <b>microprocessing</b> of miR- 211 promotes splicing of the exon 6 -exon 7 junction of melastatin by a mechanism requiring the RNase III activity of Drosha. Additionally, mutations in the 5 ' splice site (5 'SS), {{but not in}} the 3 'SS, branch point, or polypyrimidine tract of intron 6 reduced miR- 211 biogenesis and Drosha recruitment to intron 6, indicating that 5 'SS recognition by the spliceosome promotes <b>microprocessing</b> of miR- 211. Globally, knockdown of U 1 splicing factors reduced intronic miRNA expression. Our data demonstrate novel mutually-cooperative <b>microprocessing</b> and splicing activities at an intronic miRNA locus and suggest that the initiation of spliceosome assembly may promote <b>microprocessing</b> of intronic miRNAs...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} laser-induced {{structural}} modifications inside BK 7 glass (OHARA, S-BSL 7) using a femtosecond laser and a CO 2 laser system. A femtosecond laser has extremely short pulse duration (less than 10 - 12 sec) and high peak power. When an intense femtosecond laser pulse irradiates inside transparent material, the nonlinear absorption phenome-non generates around the focal spot, {{and leads to}} a localized structural modification in the material. Also CO 2 laser can gen-erate the thermal effect around laser-irradiated area. By combining the nonlinear absorption and thermal effect, we develop novel femtosecond laser <b>microprocessing</b> using thermal effect. We found the 2 -wavelengths laser <b>microprocessing</b> (TLAM) {{has the effect of}} displacing the focal point of femtosecond laser pulse with the increase of the CO 2 laser power. Moreover the TLAM increases heat-affected zone in the unit time than that using single femtosecond laser <b>microprocessing</b> (SFLAM). The processed diameter using TLAM is approximately twice the size of the diameter using SFLAM.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the given paper spatial, time and energy {{characteristics}} of a copper vapor laser (CVL|) have been investigated in the mode of one convex mirror using the most powerful industrial sealed-off active elements (AE) of “Kulon” series: 15 W GL- 206 D model and 20 W GL- 206 I model in order to define the capabilities of using its one-beam radiation for effective <b>microprocessing</b> of materials. The carried out calculations and experimental investigations showed that one can vary the radiation beam divergence within a wide range by changing the radius of curvature of CVL convex mirror; and one can reach values close to diffraction limit at radii of curvature one-two orders lower than the distance from the mirror to AE output aperture. At small radii of mirror curvature (R = 6 - 30 mm) the CVL output radiation beam divergence can only 2 - 3 times (0. 15 - 0. 35 mrad) differ from diffraction limit. At these divergences the peak power density in a focused spot can reach 109 … 1010 W/cm 2 values. With the increase of AE discharge channel length the CVL output radiation beam divergence in one-mirror mode decreases and tends to diffraction limit, while power increases, which in the aggregate leads to the sharp increase of peak power density. Therefore, from practical point of view the industrial AEs “Crystal” GL- 205 А and GL- 205 B with 0. 93 and 1. 23 m discharge channel length and 20 mm diameter are the most effective ones. Besides the formation of one high quality beam, the advantages of one-mirror mode include a high axis stability of directivity pattern of this beam and pulsed energy, which increase the quality of <b>microprocessing</b> of materials. Practical experience of using CVL with one convex mirror shows that 109 W/cm 2 peak power density level is sufficient only for efficient <b>microprocessing</b> of foiled materials and solder cutouts (0. 02 - 0. 1 мм). The use of this CVL as a driving oscillator (DO) in a copper vapor laser system (CVLS) of the type: driving oscillator – power amplifier (DO – PA) using 30 - 50 W industrial “Crystal” AEs in PAs allows to increase peak power density up to 1011 W/cm 2, sufficient for efficient and qualitative <b>microprocessing</b> of materials up to 1 mm thick. The main conclusions on the results of CVL investigations are also true for other metals vapor pulsed lasers as well as for gas and solid-state lasers with a short period of population inversion existence. </p...|$|E
