The {{determination}} method of calcium content in calcium tablet using the micro titration has introduced, {{and also has}} compared the obtaining results by the <b>microburette</b> and by the routine analysis. F examination and t examination {{are all in the}} appropriate scope. The relative standard de-viation is less than 0. 3 %. There is no obvious difference in the results...|$|E
40|$|A {{straightforward}} method {{for both the}} quantitative and the equilibrium analysis of humic acids in solution, based on the combination of potentiometry with coulometry, is presented. The method is based on potentiometric titrations of alkaline solutions containing, besides the humic acid sample, also NaClO 4 1 M; by means of constant current coulometry the analytical acidity in the solutions is increased with a high precision, until {{the formation of a}} solid phase occurs. Hence, the total acid content of the macromolecules may be determined from the e. m. f. data by using modified Gran plots or least-squares sum minimization programs as well. It is proposed to use the pKw value in the ionic medium as a check of the correctness of each experiment; this datum may be readily obtained as a side-result in each titration. Modelling acid–base equilibria of the HA samples analysed was also performed, {{on the basis of the}} buffer capacity variations occurring during each titration. The experimental data fit, having the least standard deviation, was obtained assuming a mixture of three monoprotic acids (HX, HY, HZ) having about the same analytical concentration, whose acid dissociation constants in NaClO 4 1 M at 25 ◦C were pKHX = 3. 9 ± 0. 2, pKHY = 7. 5 ± 0. 3, pKHZ = 9. 5 ± 0. 2, respectively. With the proposed method the handling of alkaline HA solutions, the titration with very dilute NaOH or HCl solutions and the need for the availability of very small volumes of titrant to be added by <b>microburettes</b> may be avoided...|$|R
