The rocky coast of Twin Islands contains the southernmost outcropping of Hartland Schist, the major bedrock component of New England coastlines, as well as granite with <b>migmatite</b> dikes as well as veins made of quartz. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem that is rare in New York State. It holds the largest continuous oak forest in Pelham Bay Park, including white, red, and black oak, as well as black cherry, white pines, Norway spruce, and black locust trees.

40|$|Sm-Nd {{data for}} the Archean {{granulite}} and amphibolite facies <b>migmatites</b> of Langøy and Hinnøy in Vesterålen are presented which indicate that their protoliths formed ∼ 2. 6 AE ago. Rubidium and U loss during a granulite facies metamorphism at ∼ 1. 8 AE caused serious disturbance of total-rock U-Pb and Rb-Sr systems. Therefore these systems do not provide any precise age information for the granulite facies <b>migmatites.</b> For the amphibolite facies <b>migmatites</b> of Vesterålen both Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and Pb-Pb total-rock systems give model ages of ∼ 2. 6 AE. The results on both granulite and amphibolite facies rocks are thus in agreement. Previous interpretations based on Pb-Pb data, which indicated an age of 3. 41 AE for the Archean terrane of Vesterålen, are not valid. One Sm-Nd model age from the granulite facies <b>migmatites</b> at Moskenesøy in Lofoten indicates that the protoliths of these <b>migmatites</b> formed ∼ 2. 0 AE ago and are thus {{not related to the}} Vesterålen <b>migmatites...</b>|$|R

25|$|One of {{the major}} aspects that changed early during the Coast Range Arc was {{the status of the}} {{northern}} end of the Farallon Plate, a portion now known as the Kula Plate. About 85million years ago, the Kula Plate broke off from the Farallon Plate to form an area of seafloor spreading called the Kula-Farallon Ridge. This change apparently had some important ramifications for regional geologic evolution. When this change was completed, Coast Range Arc volcanism returned and sections of the arc were uplifted considerably in latest Cretaceous time. This started a period of mountain building that affected much of western North America called the Laramide orogeny. In particular a large area of dextral transpression and southwest-directed thrust faulting was active from 75to 66million years ago. Much of the record of this deformation has been overridden by Tertiary age structures and the zone of Cretaceous dextral thrust faulting appears to have been widespread. It was also during this period when massive amounts of molten granite intruded highly deformed ocean rocks and assorted fragments from pre-existing island arcs, largely remnants of the Bridge River Ocean. This molten granite burned the old oceanic sediments into a glittering medium-grade metamorphic rock called schist. The older intrusions of the Coast Range Arc were then deformed under the heat and pressure of later intrusions, turning them into layered metamorphic rock known as gneiss. In some places, mixtures of older intrusive rocks and the original oceanic rocks have been distorted and warped under intense heat, weight and stress to create unusual swirled patters known as <b>migmatite,</b> appearing to have been nearly melted in the procedure.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma.

[...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich <b>migmatite,</b> a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] wide belt. Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching, shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked. This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates, about [...] Structures in the <b>migmatite</b> include folds and foliations; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier-phase folds.

500|$|The Piedmont {{geologic}} {{region is}} composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks resulting from ancient (300 to 600 million year old) sediments that were subjected to high temperatures and pressures and re-exposed about 250 to 300 million years ago.

40|$|Metasediments of the Rantasalmi-Sulkava area (Finland) show {{progressive}} {{regional metamorphism}} with migmatization. The metasediments {{are represented by}} various types of metapsammites (plagioclase-rich, quartz-rich, and layers of granitic compositions—some rich in microcline and others in plagioclase) and metapelites (dark and light layers). The <b>migmatites</b> of this area are of stromatic type. They consist of leucosomes, mesosomes, and light-coloured plagioclase-rich layers which do not fit the definition of leucosome. Melanosomes, which usually separate leucosomes and mesosomes in stromatic <b>migmatites,</b> are almost absent. The leucosomes are of three types: (i) quartz-rich; (ii) cordierite-rich; and (iii) granitic. The quartz-rich leucosomes formed first at subsolidus temperatures through recrystallization. The granitic leucosomes are considered to have developed via partial melting. The cordierite-rich leucosomes are formed—like the granitic ones—at supersolidus conditions, but the role of partial melting is not clear. The mesosomes are the metamorphic portions of the <b>migmatites</b> which are not transformed into leucosomes. They include metapsammitic layers and light-coloured metapelitic layers, both rich in plagioclase. Besides mineral reactions resulting in new assemblages during regional metamorphism, the main process changing the protoliths into <b>migmatites</b> is the conversion {{of some of the}} protolith layers into leucosomes, through (as we believe) an almost isochemical partial melting. The <b>migmatites</b> of the Rantasalmi-Sulkava area differ from other <b>migmatites</b> investigated by the authors in having two different genetic types of leucosomes: one formed via partial melting and the other through subsolidus recrystallization as mentioned above. The process of migmatization is described and modelled in three steps...|$|R
500|$|The Quetico gneiss belt extends some [...] across Ontario {{and parts}} of Minnesota. The {{dominant}} rocks within the belt are schists and gneisses produced by intense metamorphism of greywackes and minor amounts of other sedimentary rocks. The sediments, alkalic plutons and felsic plutons are aged from 2,690 to 2,680million years. The metamorphism is relatively low-grade on the margins and high-grade in the center. The low-grade components of the greywackes were derived primarily from volcanic rocks; the high-grade rocks are coarser-grained and contain minerals that reflect higher temperatures. The granitic intrusions within the high-grade metasediments were produced by subduction of the ocean crust and partial melting of metasedimentary rocks.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the compositional evolution of metamorphic terranes that underwent disequilibrium melting reactions control the petrology, the geochemistry and the isotopic composition of the resulting anatectic magmas. The high-grade metamorphic Tarra Padedda Complex (northern Sardinia, Italy) provides a suitable opportunity to study the isotopic (Sr–Nd) and geochemical evolution of both the anatectic magmatic products and their source. The metamorphic complex consists of <b>migmatites</b> (diatexites, metatexites and hornblende-bearing <b>migmatites)</b> and sillimanite-bearing metasediments, which were intruded by syntectonic peraluminous granitoids, aplites and pegmatites. The diatexites consist of stromatic <b>migmatites</b> and nebulites. Neosomes in stromatic <b>migmatites</b> show either granitic or trondhjemitic leucosomes, and hornblende-bearing or hornblende-free melanosomes. Petrographic characteristics of the melanosomes and hornblende-bearing <b>migmatites</b> suggest two distinct biotite-dehydration melting reactions: (a) biotite þ sillimanite þ plagioclase þ quartz !garnet K-feldspar þ melt; and (b) biotite þ plagioclase (An 40) þ quartz ! hornblende þ plagioclase (An. 60) þ titanite þ melt. In contrast, textural features in metatexites favour dehydration melting of muscovite: muscovite þ quartz þ plagioclase ! sillimanite þ K-feldspar þ melt. A progressive variation of chemical composition coupled with a decrease of Sr and Nd crustal isotopic signatures is observed both within the metamorphic rocks and the granitoids. Field relationships, petrological, geochemical and isotope evidence of the Tarra Padedda Complex are consistent with a multi-stage anatexis of a heterogeneous metasedimentary source within the same Hercynian orogenic cycle. The variation of Sr and Nd isotope compositions within both the granitoids and the <b>migmatites</b> is interpreted in terms of anatexis of the various metasedimentary components, via different melting reactions involving micas plus variable amounts of accessory phases (apatite, monazite, zircon and/or xenotime) ...|$|R
40|$|The Hercynian crustal {{section in}} the Serre (southem Italy) is about 20 km thick and {{includes}} sub-greenschist to granulite facies metamorphic rocks which {{have been used to}} study chemical modifications during metamorphism and migmatization. The rocks studied include: (l) Stilo phyllites and Mammola paragneisses from the upper crustal metasediments; (2) migmatitic paragneisses from the lower crustal segment that contain evidence for multi-stage melting and different degrees of partial melting and extraction of melts. The upper crustal rocks and the uppermost <b>migmatites</b> retain the composition of common shales. Descending to the lower levels the migmatitic metapelites show modified bulk compositions relative to common shales. The degree of chemical modification increases towards the base of the investigated section. The bulk-migmatites and the melanosomes show an enrichment in MgO, FeO*, Ti 02, A 1203, MnO, Sc, Y, V, Cr and REE and a depletion in Si 02, K 20, Na 20, CaO, Rb, P, U. In the lowermost migmatitic metapelites enrichment of Th and Zr is also evident. Bulk <b>migmatites</b> have negative Eu anomaly which is larger in the residua. The <b>migmatites</b> reflect: i) diverse protolith bulk compositions, ii) the effects of hydrous melting and mica dehydration melting producing both melts crystallizing in situ and melts which were extracted, iii) a different degree of melting and of separation melt-restite, iv) different effects of rehydration on cooling.

This study is a closer look on the mesoscopic and microscopic characteristics and the chemical behaviour of typestromatic <b>migmatites,</b> associated with amphibolite bands and boudins that are exposed in the northeastern part of the Migif dome, Hafafit area. Therefore, the major oxides for the studied rocks were analyzed by using the wet chemical analysis technique, whereas the trace elements analyses were carried out by XRF technique. Microprobe analyses of the investigated minerals (amphiboles, plagioclase, biotite and muscovite) were carried out with a scanning microscope and wave length dispersive spectrometers. The paragenesis and microfabric evolution of these <b>migmatites</b> show that they are affected by three phases of deformation. These are associated with metamorphic differentiation, crystallization and segregation. Geochemical variation between mesosomes and leucosomes reflect original compositional variations, enhanced by metamorphic differentiation and short-range migration resulting in segregation of bands.
