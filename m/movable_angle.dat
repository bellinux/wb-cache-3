40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether elementary school children who had participated in a simple and easy program for the improvement of running performance, held for 10 minutes a time and once a week for 12 weeks, showed an improvement in their running speed. In addition, this study aimed to make a better children's sprint program by referring to the results of the study. A total of 30 children in the second grade (26 boys and 4 girls) participated. Of the 22 out of the 30 children who improved their 50 m running speed, 8 children improved their speed by increasing the stride frequency only, 9 children improved it by extending the stride length only and 5 children increased it by improving both the stride frequency and the stride length. For the children who had improved their speed by increasing the stride frequency only, both the time that the foot was on the ground and the time that the foot was away from the ground had been significantly shortened. Additionally, the phase that the foot was away from the ground was shortened to a greater extent than the phase that the foot was on the ground. For the children who had improved their speed by extending the stride length only, the time that the foot was away from the ground was significantly extended and the <b>movable</b> <b>angle</b> of the hip and knee joints was significantly increased in the cycle of running motion. Therefore, it is thought that continuing the training may lead to improvements in running performance, even though the program is simple and easy, and is held once a week for about ten minutes...|$|E
50|$|Known as Emergency 3 in North America, this {{installment}} is {{the first}} to use a 3D engine and a <b>movable</b> camera <b>angle</b> instead of a 2D engine. In addition there are 20 brand new missions, as well as two new game-modes; free play Endless and free play Challenge, for watching over a single city.|$|R
50|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} gym equipment, costing £150,000, are all {{linked to}} a computer system which can activate a personalised fitness programme for individual players. The gym also houses an iso-kinetic machine, which allows players to work out despite being injured by testing muscle strength and reactions. There is a hydrotherapy pool that has an <b>angled,</b> <b>movable</b> floor {{and a series of}} massage jets and currents that allows a range of rehabilitation exercises to take place. There is also a media editing suite costing £50,000 which is where a video analyst will video each training session. The footage will be used to conduct tactical lessons in the lecture room afterwards.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA F- 14 {{high angle}} of attack flight test program, a nose mounted {{hemispherical}} flow direction sensor was calibrated against a fuselage mounted <b>movable</b> vane flow <b>angle</b> sensor. Significant discrepancies were found {{to exist in the}} angle of attack measurements. A two fold approach taken to resolve these discrepancies during subsonic flight is described. First, the sensing integrity of the isolated hemispherical sensor is established by wind tunnel data extending to an angle of attack of 60 deg. Second, two probable causes for the discrepancies, pneumatic lag and upwash, are examined. Methods of identifying and compensating for lag and upwash are presented. The wind tunnel data verify that the isolated hemispherical sensor is sufficiently accurate for static conditions with angles of attack up to 60 deg and angles of sideslip up to 30 deg. Analysis of flight data for two high angle of attack maneuvers establishes that pneumatic lag and upwash are highly correlated with the discrepancies between the hemispherical and vane type sensor measurements...|$|R
