All of these albums include guitar cameos from Harrison (often credited to his pseudonym [...] "Hari Georgeson"), yet his playing on Extra Texture was surprisingly minimal. Harrison's signature instrument since 1970, the slide guitar, appeared significantly on [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] only, and in his extended solo on [...] "This Guitar", on which he shared the lead guitarist's role with Jesse Ed Davis.|$|E
500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E

Angelo Congear, whose career completely overlapped with Oliver, said that [...] "As an all-roundplayer, Harold Oliver is my pick. In his prime he played a wonderfully clever game anywhere. He is also the fairest player it has been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> to play with." [...] Tom Leahy, Magarey Medalist and captain of North Adelaide, once stated after a game at Alberton Oval that [...] "North Adelaide would certainly have won had Port not possessed a superman in Oliver." [...] Vic Richardson, captain of the Sturt Football Club and Australian cricket team, described Harold Oliver as being [...] "The finest all-round exponent of Australian football in my playing and watching experience of it".|$|E

During the promotion of Stripped, she appeared on VH1's Big In Awards, Top of the Pops, and the 46th Grammy Awards. The song was included on the setlists of The Stripped Tour, the Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003 and the Back to Basics Tour in 2006.

500|$|The leading tenor part of Don José {{was given}} to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had {{recently}} appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was {{at the beginning of}} a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her [...] "one of the most charming vocalists it has been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> to know". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned by her firing from Dr. Vegas, Adams, at 30 years old, {{considered}} {{looking for}} an alternate career after finishing work on the sole project she was signed to. It was the independent comedy-drama Junebug, which had a production budget of under $1 million. Directed by Phil Morrison, the film featured Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman. Morrison was impressed by Adams' ability to not question her character's inherently good motives. She found a connection with Johnsten's faith in God, and spent time with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (where the film is set), attending Sunday church. She described making the film as [...] "the summer I grew into myself", and after dyeing her hair red for the part, she decided to {{not go back to}} her natural blonde color. Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph labeled the film a [...] "small, quiet miracle" [...] and wrote that Adams had given [...] "one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> to review". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post opined that her [...] "radiant portrayal" [...] reflected the film's [...] "deeply humanist heart". Adams received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E

In his resignation letter to President Aquino, he once again thanked him for his endorsement and vowed to [...] "begin the process of turning over {{in an orderly manner}} all the matters pending in my office." [...] During his final flag ceremony at Camp Crame, Roxas bade goodbye to his colleagues and thanked the members of the Philippine National Police.

2500|$|The first {{movement}} on Picander's text is {{a duet with}} obbligato violin. The tenor expresses the position of Jesus [...] "" [...] (I live, my heart, for your pleasure), whereas the soprano answers as the believer: [...] "" [...] (You live, my Jesus, for <b>my</b> <b>pleasure).</b> The movement resembles duets of Bach's secular cantatas and is possibly the parody of an unknown work. It is unusual that Bach has the tenor represent the voice of Jesus. The following secco recitative ends as an arioso to stress the words [...] "" [...] (My heart, take note!), a thought {{picked up in the}} following bass aria, the movement with the richest instrumentation, all instruments but the viola. It has the character of a dance in even periods and may also be a parody of a secular work. The cantata is closed by a four-part setting of the last stanza of the Easter hymn [...] "".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been <b>my</b> <b>pleasure</b> to meet. In {{all the time in the}} camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E
