The first <b>metallic</b> <b>material</b> discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium, uranium, and rhodium.|$|E

The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks.

40|$|Nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to exhibit outstanding performance which leads to their usage in challenging applications such as coatings and biomedical implant devices. To optimize the performance of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> according to the desired applications, {{it is important to have}} a decent understanding of the structure, processing and properties of these materials. Various efforts have been made to correlate microstructure and properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> Based on these research activities, it is noticed that microstructure and defects (e. g., dislocations and grain boundaries) play a key role in the behavior of these materials. Therefore, it is of great importance to establish methods to quantitatively study microstructures, defects and their interactions in nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> Since the mechanisms controlling the properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> occur at a very small length scale, it is fairly difficult to study them. Unfortunately, most of the characterization techniques used to explore these materials do not have the high enough spatial resolution required for the characterization of these materials. For instance, by applying complex profile-fitting algorithms to X-ray diffraction patterns, it is possible to get an estimation of the average grain size and the average dislocation density within a relatively large area. However, these average values are not enough for developing meticulous phenomenological models which are able to correlate microstructure and properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> As another example, electron backscatter diffraction technique also cannot be used widely in the characterization of these materials due to problems such as relative poor spatial resolution (which is ~ 90 nm) and the degradation of Kikuchi diffraction patterns in severely deformed nano-size grain <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> In this study, ASTAR/precession electron diffraction is introduced as a relatively new orientation microscopy technique to characterize defects (e. g., geometrically necessary dislocations and grain boundaries) in challenging nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> The capability of this characterization technique to quantitatively determine the dislocation density distributions of geometrically necessary dislocations in severely deformed <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> is assessed. Based on the developed method, it is possible to determine the distributions and accumulations of dislocations with respect to the nearest grain boundaries and triple junctions. Also, the competency of this technique to study the grain boundary character distributions of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> is presented...|$|R

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Blackman {{was concerned}} over the {{re-creation of the}} Klingon uniforms seen in The Original Series as {{he thought that the}} <b>metallic</b> <b>material</b> used would be nearly impossible to create accurately. He was subsequently relieved to have found four original costumes and an additional shirt in the costume archives, calling them a [...] "godsend". His team created patterns from other costumes to remake them. Make-up supervisor Michael Westmore had previously worked on a television series during the 1960s and recalled what type of make-up was available at the time. He had the team restrict themselves to techniques of that era to ensure that the DS9 crew blended properly into the scenes. The hairstyles of the crew were also meant to be reminiscent of The Original Series, with Alexander Siddig sporting a style previously seen on James Doohan. René Auberjonois said that his new hairstyle reminded him of Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} of polyacetylene polymerization {{was made by}} Hideki Shirakawa’s group {{who were able to}} prepare silvery films of polyacetylene. They discovered that the polymerization of polyacetylene could be achieved at the surface of a concentrated solution of the catalyst system of Et3Al and Ti(OBu)4 in an inert solvent such as toluene. In parallel with Shirakawa's studies, Alan Heeger and Alan MacDiarmid were studying the metallic properties of polythiazyl , a related but inorganic polymer. [...] Polythiazyl caught Heeger's interest as a chain-like <b>metallic</b> <b>material,</b> and he collaborated with Alan MacDiarmid who had previous experience with this material. By the early 1970s, this polymer was known to be superconductive at low temperatures. Shirakawa, Heeger, and MacDiarmid collaborated on further development of polyacetylene.|$|E

60|$|Thus far {{of labor}} or wages {{as an element}} in cost of production. But in our analysis, in the First Book, of the {{requisites}} of production, we found that there is another necessary element in it besides labor. There is also capital; and this being the result of abstinence, the produce, or its value, must be sufficient to remunerate, not only all the labor required, but the abstinence of all the persons by whom the remuneration of the different classes of laborers was advanced. The return from abstinence is Profit. And profit, we have also seen, is not exclusively the surplus remaining to the capitalist after he has been compensated for his outlay, but forms, in most cases, no unimportant part of the outlay itself. The flax-spinner, part of whose expenses consists of the purchase of flax and of machinery, has had to pay, in their price, not only the wages of the labor by which the flax was grown and the machinery made, but the profits of the grower, the flax-dresser, the miner, the iron-founder, and the machine-maker. All these profits, together {{with those of the}} spinner himself, were again advanced by the weaver, in the price of his material—linen yarn; and along with them the profits of a fresh set of machine-makers, and of the miners and iron-workers who supplied them with their <b>metallic</b> <b>material.</b> All these advances form part of the cost of production of linen. Profits, therefore, as well as wages, enter into the cost of production which determines the value of the produce.|$|E
