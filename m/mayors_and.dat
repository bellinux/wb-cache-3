There are self-governing towns outside the cities as well as precincts of urban wards. Like the cities, {{each has its own}} elected mayor and assembly. Villages are the smallest self-governing entities in rural areas.

Villages have <b>mayors</b> <b>and</b> councils elected to four-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Following his election, O'Malley's first {{personnel}} {{decision was}} {{to retain the}} director of the city's economic development agency.

5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the country into a full federation by allowing the election of town <b>mayors</b> <b>and</b> provincial presidents (governors).|$|E

5|$|GO Transit {{also went}} through three major reconfigurations. In January 1997, the {{province}} {{announced it would}} transfer funding responsibility for GO Transit to GTHA municipalities. The Greater Toronto Services Board, composed of regional municipality chairs, city <b>mayors</b> <b>and</b> municipal councillors, was created as a municipal agency in January 1999, and GO Transit was transferred as an arm of this agency in August 1999. However, then-Premier Mike Harris announced the province would re-assume funding responsibility for GO Transit two years later, and this was completed with {{the abolition of the}} Greater Toronto Services Board on January 1, 2002. The Greater Toronto Transportation Authority was created in 2006, with the responsibilities of co-ordinating, planning, financing and developing integrated transit in the GTHA. This agency would then become merged with GO Transit in 2009 under the name Metrolinx. GO Transit would continue as an operating division alongside two other major initiatives: the Union Pearson Express and Presto card.|$|E

Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned <b>mayors</b> <b>and</b> city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him.
