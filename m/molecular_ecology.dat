5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication <b>Molecular</b> <b>Ecology</b> in 1992. <b>Molecular</b> <b>ecology</b> uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. <b>Molecular</b> <b>ecology</b> engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, <b>molecular</b> <b>ecology</b> revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, modern {{biological}} sciences (including even {{concepts such as}} <b>molecular</b> <b>ecology)</b> are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly {{thought of as the}} life sciences industry. [...] Biotechnology is the research and development in the laboratory using bioinformatics for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production from any living organisms and any source of biomass by means of biochemical engineering where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by biosynthesis, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured, and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment, especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products).|$|E

50|$|Originally {{working in}} {{cooperation}} with Dr. David Stahl, Rittmann introduced the powerful tools of molecular biology to environmental engineering, helping create the exciting field known today as Environmental Biotechnology, in which {{the goal is to}} manage microbial communities so that they provide services to society. The tools of <b>molecular</b> microbial <b>ecology</b> directly interrogate the genetic information in microorganisms. They make it possible to determine what types of microorganisms are present in the complex communities of environmental biotechnologies, what reactions those microorganisms can carry out, what reactions they are carrying out, and how they interact with each other and their environment. Now working hand-in-glove with Center colleague Dr. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, Rittmann is using <b>molecular</b> microbial <b>ecology</b> to understand and manage microbial communities {{in a wide range of}} microbiological processes used for removing pollution from water, generating renewable resources, and improving human health.|$|R
