40|$|The genetic {{determinants}} for replication and incompatibility of plasmid R 1 {{were investigated}} by gene cloning methods, and {{three types of}} R 1 <b>miniplasmid</b> derivatives were generated. The first, exemplified by plasmid pKT 300, consisted of a single BglII endonuclease-generated deoxyribonucleic acid fragment derived from the R 1 region that is located between the determinants for conjugal transfer and antibiotic resistance. Two types of miniplasmids could be formed from PstI endonuclease-generated fragments of pKT 300. One of these, which is equivalent to miniplasmids previously generated from plasmids R 1 - 19 and R 1 - 19 B 2, consisted of two adjacent PstI fragments that encode the RepA replication system of plasmid R 1. The other type contained a segment of R 1, designated the RepD replication region, that is adjacent to the RepA region and {{that has not been}} identified previously as having the capacity for autonomous replication. Plasmid R 1, therefore, contained two distinct deoxyribonucleic acid segments capable of autonomous replication. The RepA-RepD <b>miniplasmid</b> pKT 300 had a copy number about eightfold higher than that of R 1 and hence lacked a determinant for the regulation of plasmid copy number. Like R 1, it was maintained stably in dividing bacteria. RepA miniplasmids had copy numbers which were two- to fourfold higher than that of R 1 (i. e., which were lower than that of pKT 300) and were maintained slightly less stably than those of pKT 300 and R 1. The RepD <b>miniplasmid</b> was not maintained stably in dividing bacteria. Previous experiments have shown that incompatibility of IncFII group plasmids is specified by a plasmid copy control gene. Despite the fact that RepA miniplasmids of R 1 were defective in copy control, they nevertheless expressed incompatibility. This suggests that two genes are responsible for plasmid copy control, one that specifies incompatibility and is located on RepA miniplasmids and another that is located outside of, but adjacent to, the RepA replication region. Hybrid plasmids composed of pBR 322 and one PstI fragment from the RepA region, P- 8, exhibited incompatibility towards R 2 and RepA miniplasmids but not the RepD <b>miniplasmid,</b> whereas hybrids composed of pBR 322 and the PstI fragment of the RepD region, P- 3, exhibited incompatibility towards R 1 and the RepD <b>miniplasmid</b> but not RepA miniplasmids. These results indicate that the two replication systems are functionally distinct and that, although the RepA system is the principal replication system of R 1, the RepD system also plays a role in the maintenance of this plasmid...|$|E
40|$|Several pAD 1 <b>miniplasmids</b> were {{constructed}} {{that consisted of}} all or {{a portion of the}} pAD 1 EcoRI B fragment with pheromone-inducible "E region" lacZ transcriptional fusions. <b>Miniplasmids</b> containing the entire EcoRI B fragment (the "E miniplasmids") were found to regulate LacZ expression normally, indicating that sufficient information is present on this fragment to regulate a pheromone response. These plasmids also encoded normal replication functions. The E <b>miniplasmids</b> were further reduced by deleting a KpnI fragment. These "K miniplasmids" were able to perform most of the functions central to a pheromone response but failed to induce the fused transcripts to levels observed in the parental plasmids. This defect was found to be due to a pheromone-dependent growth inhibition of cells containing the K <b>miniplasmids.</b> Evidence indicated that this inhibition was due to transcriptional readthrough beyond the lacZ gene and into the putative replication region of the plasmid. Possible mechanisms of this inhibition as well as its potential usefulness in further examining the characteristics of the pheromone response are discussed...|$|R

If either ssiA or ssiB was deleted or inverted, the RSF 1010 <b>miniplasmids</b> containing engineered oriVs were maintained at low copy numbers, replicated abnormally as dimers, and accumulated specific single strands in the Escherichia coli strain supplying the three RSF 1010 -encoded RepA, RepB', and RepC proteins. Interestingly, an additional intracellular supply of the Sog primase (the sog gene product of plasmid CoIIb-P 9) reversed the replication deficiency of these <b>miniplasmids</b> with respect to all three aspects described above. These were also true for the RSF 1010 <b>miniplasmids</b> in which either ssiA or ssiB was replaced by the primosome assembly site (PAS) or by the G 4 -type ssi signal (G site). Furthermore, comparative analysis of the functional contribution of the two oppositely oriented ssi signals to the DNA replication of RSF 1010 showed that, irrespective of their types, ssi signals conducting the initiation of DNA chain elongation away from the iterons were functionally more important than ones in the inverted orientation. We consider that this functional difference reflects the inherent properties of the initiation mechanism of RSF 1010 DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|Major {{heat shock}} proteins, {{such as the}} Escherichia coli DnaK protein, not only are {{required}} for cell growth after heat shock but seem to possess important functions in cellular metabolism at normal growth temperatures as well. E. coli delta dnaK 52 mutants have severe cellular defects at 30 degrees C, {{one of which is}} in cell division (B. Bukau and G. C. Walker, J. Bacteriol, 171 : 2337 - 2346, 1989). Here we show that at 30 degrees C, delta dnaK 52 mutants have defects in chromosome segregation and in maintenance of low-copy-number plasmids. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that chromosomes were frequently lacking at peripheries of cell filaments of delta dnaK 52 mutants and clustered at other locations. In other parts of the cell filaments, chromosomes were apparently normally distributed and they were also present in most of the small cells found in populations of delta dnaK 52 cells. These defects might be at the level of DNA replication, since delta dnaK 52 mutants have a threshold lower rate of DNA synthesis than wild-type cells. Chromosome segregation defects of delta dnaK 52 mutants were also observed in an rnh dnaA mutant background, in which initiation of DNA replication is DnaA-oriC independent. We also found that low-copy-number P 1 <b>miniplasmids</b> could not be stably maintained in delta dnaK 52 mutants at 30 degrees C. delta par P 1 <b>miniplasmids</b> that carry the P 1 -encoded rep functions required for their replication but lack the P 1 -encoded par functions required for faithful partitioning of the plasmids during cell division were also unstable in delta dnaK 52 mutants. Taken together, our results indicate important, although not absolutely essential, functions for DnaK at 30 degrees C in one or more processes necessary for correct replication and/or partitioning of chromosomes and P 1 <b>miniplasmids.</b> Furthermore, we found that P 1 <b>miniplasmids</b> were also highly unstable in dnaJ 259 mutants, indicating a role for the DnaJ heat shock protein in maintenance of these plasmids...|$|R

40|$|Small, closed {{circular}} {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} molecules, called miniplasmids, {{were observed in}} Escherichia coli harboring copy number mutants of the R plasmid NR 1 after growth in medium containing tetracycline. The level of tetracycline resistance conferred by the copy mutant plasmids was lower (3 to 6 microgram/ml) than that conferred by NR 1 (100 MICROGRAM/ML). The presence of the <b>miniplasmid</b> enhanced the level of tetracycline resistance conferred by the copy mutant. Miniplasmids of molecular weights 4 X 10 (6) to 13 X 10 (6) were found. They carried no antibiotic resistance markers and could be eliminated by growth {{in the presence of}} chloramphenicol and/or streptomycin-spectinomycin. Studies with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and Sal I indicated that the miniplasmids are derived from the region of the copy mutant plasmids that contains the origin for replication of the resistance transfer factor.

Plasmids containing both f 5 and f 7 fragments were also obtained. Expression of resistance to "female-specific" bacteriophages requires that f 5 and f 7 {{be present in the}} same plasmid since cells containing separate f 5 and f 7 plasmids are not resistant to bacteriophage phi II. f 7 plasmids were less stable than <b>miniplasmids</b> containing f 5, particularly at fast growth rates.

In this report we describe three improvements in the earlier constructions.

Second, a series of <b>miniplasmids</b> have been developed, which we call adaptors, and these <b>miniplasmids</b> {{can be used to}} convert virtually any DNA segment into a ClaI fragment suitable for insertion into the retroviral (or other) vectors.

When Escherichia coli ML 1410 (Rms 201 ts 14) + was grown at temperatures between 40 and 42 °C in L broth, antibiotic-sensitive cells were segregated. When the incubation temperature of ML 1410 (Rms 201 ts 14) + in L-broth was shifted to 42 from 30 °C, {{the increase in}} the number of antibiotic-resistant cells ceased 90 min after the temperature shift. However, the total number of cells continuously increased, and only 3 % of the cells retained the plasmid at 5 h after the temperature shift to 42 °C. At 30 °C the amounts of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid per chromosome of Rms 201 ts 14 and Rms 201 were 3. 8 and 6. 3 %, respectively. Incorporation of radioactive thymidine into the covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of Rms 201 ts 14 did not take place at 42 °C, whereas radioactive thymidine was incorporated into the covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of Rms 201 at a rate of 4 %/chromosome even at 42 °C. The synthesis of plasmid covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid in a cell harboring Rms 201 ts 14 was almost completely blocked at 42 °C.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of this 4. 2 -kb region revealed the presence of three possible reading frames in the same direction (repA, repB, and repC). Proteins coded for by these frames were identified by in vitro synthesis in a coupled transcription-translation system. The replicating ability became attenuated by repA and repB mutations but was completely abolished by repC mutations. The size, arrangement, and mutational effects of the three rep genes were quite similar to those of the rep genes that were previously identified in the hairy root-inducing plasmid pRiA 4 b.

40|$|By {{transformation}} of dnaA null mutant host {{cells that are}} suppressed either by an rnh mutation or by chromosomal integration of a mini-R 1 plasmid, it was shown that replication of <b>miniplasmids</b> composed of the NR 1 minimal replicon had no absolute dependence upon DnaA protein. In addition, {{the suppression of the}} dnaA null mutation by the integrated mini-R 1, which is an IncFII relative of NR 1, was found {{to be sensitive to the}} expression of IncFII-specific plasmid incompatibility. This suggests that the integrative suppression by mini-R 1 is under the control of the normal IncFII plasmid replication circuitry. Although NR 1 replication had no absolute requirement for DnaA, the copy numbers of NR 1 -derived <b>miniplasmids</b> were lower in dnaA null mutants, and the plasmids exhibited a much reduced stability of inheritance during subculture in the absence of selection. This suggests that DnaA protein may participate in IncFII plasmid replication in some auxiliary way, such as by increasing the efficiency of formation of an open initiation complex at the plasmid replication origin. Such an auxiliary role for DnaA in IncFII replication would be different from that for replication of most other plasmids examined, for which DnaA has been found to be either essential or unimportant...|$|R

The nucleotide sequence of pCAR 1 has been determined previously. In this study, we characterized pCAR 1 {{in terms of its}} replication, maintenance, and conjugation. By constructing <b>miniplasmids</b> of pCAR 1 and testing their establishment in Pseudomonas putida DS 1, we show that pCAR 1 replication is due to the repA gene and its upstream DNA region. The repA gene and putative oriV region could be separated in P. putida DS 1, and the oriV region was determined to be located within the 345 -bp region between the repA and parW genes. Incompatibility testing using the minireplicon of pCAR 1 and IncP plasmids indicated that pCAR 1 belongs to the IncP- 7 group. Monitoring of the maintenance properties of serial <b>miniplasmids</b> in nonselective medium, and mutation and complementation analyses of the parWABC genes, showed that the stability of pCAR 1 is attributable to the products of the parWAB genes. In mating assays, the transfer of pCAR 1 from CA 10 was detected in a CA 10 derivative that was cured of pCAR 1 (CA 10 dm 4) and in P. putida KT 2440 at frequencies of 3 × 10 − 1 and 3 × 10 − 3 per donor strain, respectively.

A derivative of the pi VX <b>miniplasmid,</b> pi AN 7 beta 1, was constructed by insertion of the 600 -base-pair 3 ' untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA expressed in human fibroblasts.

The amino acid and nucleotide sequences encoded by the unmutated gene predict that a guanine-to-adenine transition is responsible for the glycine-to-aspartic acid mutation at codon 244 and would also result in the loss of a HaeIII site.

These and other experiments have shown that three plasmid determinants [...] copA/incA, copB, and copT [...] are involved in DNA replication control. The products of the copB and copA/incA genes, a 9500 -dalton basic polypeptide and either a 7200 -dalton basic polypeptide or a short untranslated RNA molecule, respectively, are negative-acting elements that interact with the third element, their target, the copT DNA sequence, or its product to regulate the frequency of initiation of plasmid replication. The location of copT within the copA/incA gene and 1600 base pairs upstream from the origin of replication indicates that regulation is effected at a preinitiation stage of replication, such as {{the production of a}} primer or other initiation factor...|$|R
40|$|PY 54 is a {{temperate}} phage isolated from Yersinia enterocolitica. Lysogenic Yersinia strains harbour the PY 54 prophage as a plasmid (pY 54). The plasmid {{has the same}} size (46 kb) as the PY 54 genome isolated from phage particles. By electron microscopy, restriction analysis and DNA sequencing, it was demonstrated that the phage and the plasmid DNAs are linear, circularly permuted molecules. Unusually for phages of Gram-negative bacteria, the phage genome has 3 '-protruding ends. The linear plasmid pY 54 has covalently closed ends forming telomere-like hairpins. The equivalent DNA sequence of the phage genome is a 42 bp perfect palindrome. Downstream from the palindrome, an open reading frame (ORF) was identified that revealed strong DNA homology to the telN gene of Escherichia coli phage N 15 encoding a protelomerase. Similar to PY 54, the N 15 prophage is a linear plasmid with telomeres. The N 15 protelomerase has cleaving/joining activity generating the telomeres by processing a 56 bp palindrome (telomere resolution site tel RL). To study {{the activity of the}} PY 54 protein, the telN-like gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli. A 77 kDa protein was obtained and partially purified. The protein was found to process recombinant plasmids containing the 42 bp palindrome. Telomere resolution of plasmids under in vivo conditions was also investigated in Yersinia infected with PY 54. Processing required a plasmid containing the palindrome as well as adjacent DNA sequences from the phage including an additional inverted repeat. Regions on the phage genome important for plasmid maintenance were defined by the construction of linear and circular <b>miniplasmid</b> derivatives of pY 54, of which the smallest <b>miniplasmid</b> comprises a 4. 5 kb DNA fragment of the plasmid prophage...|$|E
40|$|Construction and {{characterization}} {{of a class}} of multicopy plasmid cloning vehicles containing the replication system of <b>miniplasmid</b> P 15 A are described. The constructed plasmids have cleavage sites within antibiotic resistance genes {{for a variety of}} commonly employed site-specific endonucleases, permitting convenient use of the insertional inactivation procedure for the selection of clones that contain hybrid DNA molecules. Although the constructed plasmids showed DNA sequence homology with the ColE 1 plasmid within the replication region, were amplifiable by chloramphenicol or spectinomycin, required DNA polymerase I for replication, and shared other replication properties with ColE 1, they were nevertheless compatible with ColE 1. P 15 A-derived plasmids were not self-transmissible and were mobilized poorly by Hfr strains; however, mobilization was complemented by the presence of a ColE 1 plasmid within the same cell...|$|E
40|$|Replication {{functions}} of a bacteriophage P 1 <b>miniplasmid</b> are {{carried on a}} 1. 2 -kilobase pair (kb) segment that can be subdivided into a 245 -base pair (bp) replication origin and a 959 -bp region that encodes a protein required for replication (RepA). The origin region contains five 19 -bp direct repeats. By using primer extension and gene-fusion assays, we mapped the promoter of the repA gene within the repeated sequences and showed that the promoter is repressed by RepA. Regulation of RepA synthesis is apparently achieved by the binding of RepA to the repeat sequences. This regulation might be a key step in the replication-control circuit, as we found that overproduction of RepA (from a foreign promoter) inhibits replication. Thus, {{in addition to being}} an autoregulated activator of replication, the protein also can have a negative regulatory role...|$|E
40|$|Replication of plasmid R 1 is {{controlled}} by the products of two genes, copA and copB, that act as inhibitors of replication. Here it is shown that one small RNA synthesized from the copA gene acts as replication inhibitor. This RNA molecule was identified from analyses of RNAs synthesized in EScherichia coli minicells carrying R 1 <b>miniplasmids</b> or chimeric plasmids containing the copA gene. In minicells, This RNA was found to be unstable with a half-life of less than a few minutes. Two mutant hybrid plasmids lacking the inhibitor function did not express the RNA normally made from plasmids carrying the wild-type copA allele. Nucleotide sequence analysis of one of the copA mutants showed that a base substitution had occurred within the promoter sequence in front of the copA gene. DNA sequence analysis of the other mutant showed that a putative transcription-termination sequence was affected. The DNA sequence analysis also showed that the RNA molecule synthesized from the copA gene is untranslatable but has the potential for a high degree of secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|Replication of the mini-R 1 {{plasmids}} pKN 177 and pKN 182 can {{be carried}} out efficiently in cell extracts of Escherichia coli and depends on both transcription and translation. Heteroduplex and restriction analyses indicate that both plasmids are derived from the R 1 copy mutant pKN 104 by Is 1 -mediated recombination events without involving structural alterations in the replication region. To ascertain whether the in vitro replication of these <b>miniplasmids</b> corresponds to R 1 replication in vivo, the origin and direction of replication were analyzed by electron microscopy of replicative intermediates. It was found that replication starts at a unique origin located within the RepA region at R 1 coordinate at 82. 4 kilobases and proceeds unidirectionally toward the IS/b sequence. The specification of the origin and the direction of in vitro replication are therefore in full agreement with the pattern observed previously for the in vivo replication of the closely related plasmids R 100 and R 6 - 5. This agreement provides additional evidence that R 1 DNA synthesis in vitro employs the same replication mechanism as it does in vivo...|$|R
40|$|A {{restriction}} {{map of the}} 272 -kb IncHI 2 plasmid R 478 was constructed by using the enzymes ApaI, XbaI, Sail, and XhoI. The map was derived from cloned restriction fragments from R 478 inserted into cosmid and plasmid vectors {{as well as from}} double-digestion analysis of R 478 and R 478 <b>miniplasmids.</b> All previously known resistance determinants were cloned from R 478, and their positions were located on the {{restriction map}}. A region involved in incompatibility was cloned and mapped. The location of a previously unreported arsenite resistance gene was also determined. The genes encoding tellurite resistance, colicin B resistance, and phage inhibition were found to be associated with a 6. 7 -kb Sail fragment of R 478. The first reported isolation of a plasmid of the H incom-patibility group was from the chloramphenicol-resistant Sal-monella typhi strain responsible for the 1972 Mexican ty-phoid epidemic (2). IncH plasmids have since been shown to encode for multiple drug and metal resistances in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1, 31, 36). Plasmids from this group are large, with molecular masses of up to 200 MDa (36, 37). Two major IncH plasmid groups, designated IncHI an...|$|R
