5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the severe}} amount of {{poaching}} for its <b>musk</b> gland, the <b>deer</b> population {{is continuing to}} decrease. It is expected that the population will be reduced to at least 30% {{over the next three}} generations. However, efforts from each sighted countries are beginning to reintroduce the <b>musk</b> <b>deer’s</b> population.|$|R
50|$|Another threat {{comes from}} the habit loss by deforestation. For a long period, China cut more of its forest than they could replant. 200million cm3 of China’s forest recourses were cut down in the past 25 years in order to harvest the timber stock in trade for commerce. Deforestation is a severe threat to the <b>musk</b> <b>deer’s</b> long term {{survival}} because the deer can only live in a few areas.|$|R
25|$|In three days, Mireuk fled {{his prison}} by {{transforming}} into a <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> In response, Seokga led his three thousand priests to kill Mireuk. Seokga killed and ate the <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> and shared Mireuk's flesh with his priests. But {{two of the}} priests refused to eat the venison. They were killed by Seokga, {{and turned into a}} large rock and a pine tree. However, people still eat flower pancakes (Hwajeon) in remembrance of the murdered priests.|$|E
25|$|Great Himalayan National Park: This park {{is located}} in Himachal Pradesh and ranges in {{altitude}} from 5,000 to 17,500 feet. Wildlife resident here includes the snow leopard, the Himalayan brown bear and the <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E

[...] "Beavers and <b>musk</b> <b>deers</b> were sought after for castoreum and musk, respectively. The secretions from their anal glands (sometimes confused with their testicles) were used in medicine {{as well as in}} cosmetics. Ancient legend had it that when the beaver sensed he was about to be captured in a hunt, he would voluntarily castrate himself to elude capture. It is this story which this illustration in f. 28r tries to render." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although more {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "musk", the term itself is often used to describe a wide variety of [...] "musky" [...] substances from other animals such as the African civet ("civet musk") or various synthetic musks whose compound exhibits some character of <b>deer</b> <b>musk.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{wide range}} of land mammals {{can be found in}} the {{habitats}} around the lake, such as brown bear, wolf, red fox, sable, stoat, moose, Siberian red deer, reindeer, Siberian roe deer, Siberian <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> wild boar, red squirrel, Siberian chipmunk, marmot, lemming and Alpine hare. Until the Early Middle Ages, the wisent (or European bison) was present near the lake, which was the easternmost part of its range.|$|E
25|$|Animals such as yaks and dzos roam {{across the}} wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a {{decrease}} in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the Tibetan antelope, argali, kiangs, <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. However, in the Lahaul valley, one can see ibex, brown bears, foxes and snow leopards during winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley is}} {{blessed with the}} good {{population}} of snow leopards, ibex, Himalayan Brown Bear, <b>Musk</b> <b>Deer,</b> Himalayan Blue Sheep etc. which serves as the boon for the wildlife lovers. There are two important protected areas {{in the region that}} are a home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, people of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.|$|E

25|$|The faunal {{complex of}} the region is {{represented}} by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms. The ungulate complex is represented by seven species, with Manchurian wapiti, Siberian roe deer, and wild boar being the most common throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce-fir forests. Sika deer are restricted to the southern half of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. Siberian <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> and Amur moose {{are associated with the}} conifer forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote-Alin mountains.|$|E
25|$|Bears, foxes, otters, and sables are numerous, as are {{reindeer}} in the north, and <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> hares, squirrels, rats, {{and mice}} everywhere. The bird fauna is mostly the common east Siberian, {{but there are}} some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer) and the Sakhalin leaf warbler (Phylloscopus borealoides). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (Oncorhynchus). Numerous whales visit the sea coast, including the critically endangered Western Pacific gray whale, for which the coast of Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground. Other endangered whale species known to occur in this area are the North Pacific right whale, the bowhead whale and the beluga whale.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
50|$|The Aleut {{survived by}} hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, {{as well as}} {{harvesting}} sea mammals such as seal, walrus and whales. The fish and sea animals were processed {{in a variety of}} ways: dried, smoked or roasted. Caribou, <b>musk</b> oxen, <b>deer,</b> moose, whale and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. Berries were dried. They were also processed as alutiqqutigaq, a mixture of berries, fat and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale was a delicacy, as was walrus.Today many Aleut continue to eat their traditional foods, but also buy the processed foods from Outside, which are very expensive in Alaska.|$|R
50|$|Good <b>deer</b> <b>musk</b> is {{of a dark}} purplish color, dry, {{smooth and}} {{unctuous}} to the touch, and bitter in taste. The grain of musk will distinctly scent millions of cubic feet of air without any appreciable loss of weight, and its scent is not only more penetrating but more persistent than {{that of any other}} known substance. In addition to its odoriferous principle, it contains ammonia, cholesterol, fatty matter, a bitter resinous substance, and other animal principles.|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic musks, {{known as}} white musks in the perfume industry, are {{a class of}} {{synthetic}} aromachemicals to emulate the scent of <b>deer</b> <b>musk</b> or other natural musk. Synthetic musks have a clean, smooth and sweet scent lacking the fecal/"animalic" [...] notes of natural musks and are sometimes attributed as having notes of blackberry, ambrette or ambergris. These compounds are essential in modern perfumery and form the base note foundations of most perfume formulas. Most, if not all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic.|$|R
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions {{that it was}} female; perhaps even a female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that {{it is at least}} a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a secondary sexual characteristic, weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Of {{wild species}} of ungulate, deer are the {{preferred}} prey family. In {{a study in}} the Italian Alps, the most common prey species of all was the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), which made up 32.2% of nest remains. The roe deer was also a prominent prey item in the French Pyrenees (14.9%) and Switzerland (14.6%), respectively. In several parts of the Scottish Highlands, red deer (Cervus elaphus) are eaten with some regularity, the maximum representation there being 22.3% of prey remains in the Northwest Highlands. In North America, several deer species, but mainly mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns, were significant in the diet in Washington state (14.3%) and California (12.7%). Around the Himalayas, the small white-bellied <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). In the near Arctic regions of Scandinavia, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity; one study in northern Sweden found reindeer formed 11.4% of prey items. In the northernmost stretches of Alaska, golden eagles are more scarce than in equivalent areas of Scandinavia and only occasionally hunt wild reindeer. However, golden eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the Porcupine caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. Partial moose (Alces alces) remains have been found at a nest in Sweden. Live fawns and carrion probably comprise most of the golden eagle's consumption of deer (certainly in larger-bodied species such as red deer). Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) calves in Europe. Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) comprised about 15% of the remains found at a nest in Mongolia. Up to seven wild species of goat, five other wild species of sheep and at least two wild gazelle species are confirmed golden eagle prey. In North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are occasionally hunted.|$|E

5000|$|The {{material}} hardens {{and ages}} {{until it becomes}} a fairly sterile, rock-like material (also referred to as [...] "Africa Stone") that contains compounds giving it an animal, deeply complex fermented scent that combines the elements of musk, castoreum, civet, tobacco and agarwood. The material is harvested without disturbing the animals by digging strata of the brittle, resinous, irregular, blackish-brown stone; because animals are not harmed in its harvesting, it is often an ethical substitute for <b>deer</b> <b>musk</b> and civet, which require killing or inflicting pain on the animal.|$|R

50|$|The musk glands of the full-grown {{males have}} been {{collected}} for use in soaps and perfumes. The deer are hunted by people and companies looking to make money. At {{one point in the}} 1980s, the musk of the adult male deer was worth four times its weight in gold. Because of its high demand in the soap and perfume market, the price of the musk was very high. Another reason the deer are hunted is due to the belief that the <b>musk</b> of the <b>deer</b> has medicinal purposes. By tradition, they use it as a sedative and a stimulant.|$|R

50|$|<b>Deer</b> <b>musk</b> {{was unknown}} in the Western world in {{classical}} antiquity and reference to {{it does not appear}} until the 5th century AD when it is mentioned in the Talmud (Brachot 43.) as an animal-based fragrance. The 6th-century Greek explorer Cosmas Indicopleustes mentioned it as a product obtained from India. Soon afterwards Arab and Byzantine perfume makers began to use it, and it acquired a reputation as an aphrodisiac. Under the Abbasid Empire of Arabs it was highly regarded, and the caliphs of Baghdad used it lavishly. In the early 9th century, Al-Kindi included it in a large number of his perfume recipes and it became one of the important luxury items brought by Arabian ships from the East.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{obtaining the}} <b>deer</b> <b>musk</b> {{requires}} killing the endangered animal, nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called [...] "white musk". They {{can be divided}} into three major classes: aromatic nitro musks, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk compounds. The first two groups have broad uses in industry ranging from cosmetics to detergents. However, the detection of the first two chemical groups in human and environmental samples as well as their carcinogenic properties initiated a public debate on the use of these compounds and a ban or reduction of their use in many regions of the world. Macrocyclic musk compounds are expected to replace them since these compounds appear to be safer.|$|R
