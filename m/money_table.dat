25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he will speak in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the <b>money</b> <b>tables.</b> Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what they should have done — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|R

30|$|Contrary to Da et al. (2011), {{we observe}} a weak {{evidence}} of Google data ability to forecast (with negative sign) the long-term cumulative returns. Nevertheless, {{in line with}} the authors, we show that the high attention IPOs leaving a lot of <b>money</b> on the <b>table</b> experience a price reversal in long-term. In correspondence with the initial returns results, the long-term cumulative returns seem to be inversely proportional to the IPO investor attention only for firms that emitted shares during the positive sentiment periods. The findings correspond to predictions of Derrien (2005) claiming that it is the overoptimistic investors who leave the <b>money</b> on the <b>table</b> rather than the issuing firms.|$|R

Furthermore, there is the promise that these agents can be integrated into practicable electronic commerce systems which would not only leave less <b>money</b> on the <b>table,</b> but would enable new types of transactions to be negotiated cost eflectively.

Not only is there a direct cost in employing an underwriter but this study suggests there might also be an indirect cost.
