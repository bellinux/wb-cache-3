50|$|Malignant edema (or <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema)</b> is an acute, {{generally}} rapidly fatal wound infection (toxemia) {{most common}} in grazing animals. It affects cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, and deer. It is caused {{by one or more}} species of bacteria in the Clostridium genus.|$|E
40|$|Moderate {{hypothermia}} {{may reduce}} mortality in malignant brain infarction. However, {{due to the}} extremely limited number of patients treated, it is still unknown whether it may be beneficial if undertaken several days after acute stroke, when {{the probability of a}} <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema</b> is higher. We report on a patient with malignant brain oedema after middle cerebral artery infarction, who was treated with moderate hypothermia on the third day after stroke when he became comatose. Hypothermia was induced at a rate of 1. 25 °C/h by an intravascular cooling catheter. The target temperature of 32 °C was reached in about 6  h. After 36  h of hypothermia, the patient was actively re-warmed at a rate of 0. 2 °C/h. The patient survived and showed a progressive reduction of mass effect on CT scan. This single case study suggests a beneficial effect of hypothermia in the treatment of severe space-occupying ischemic infarction even on the third day after stroke onset...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} transient response second harmonic imaging (HI) by means of ultrasound to assess abnormalities of cerebral echo contrast agent enhancement in patients with acute stroke.  METHODS—The study comprised 25 patients with acute onset of hemispheric stroke (< 24 h) with sufficient insonation conditions and 14 control subjects without cerebrovascular disease. All stroke patients had HI, extracranial and transcranial colour coded duplex examinations of the arteries supplying the brain, and clinical examinations (European stroke scale) performed in the acute phase, on day 2,and within 1 week. Acute CT was repeated within 1 week and facultatively accompanied by angiography. Examinations using HI were performed in an axial diencephalic plane of section using the transtemporal acoustic bone window. After bolus application of galactose based microbubbles, 61 ultrasound images with a cardiac cycling triggering frequency of once every 2 seconds were recorded and evaluated off line. Focal perfusion deficit was identified if no contrast enhancement was visualised in a circumscribed region of interest and insufficient temporal bone window was excluded. In cases of reappearance of contrast enhancement reperfusion was assessed.  RESULTS—Adequate cerebral contrast enhancement {{could be seen in}} 21 subjects. In seven, a large hemispheric deficit of contrast enhancement affecting the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was detectable; the lentiform nucleus was affected in three subjects. Assessment of cerebral contrast abnormalities was possible in two patients with superficial MCA infarctions but in none of the patients with lacunar ischaemias. None of the control persons had focal deficits of cerebral echo contrast enhancement. In all patients with complete MCA infarction and striatocapsular infarction, presumed ischaemic areas in HI examinations correlated with final CT findings. Overall sensitivity and specifity of HI examinations for predicting size and localisation of the infarction were 75 and 100 %, respectively. During follow up, reappearance of contrast enhancement was determined in three patients, in two patients circulatory arrest due to <b>malignant</b> brain <b>oedema</b> with missing contrast enhancement in the entire cerebral hemisphere could be seen. Extent of contrast enhancement deficits significantly correlated with the clinical status on admission and after 1 week (p< 0. 01).  CONCLUSIONS—Second harmonic imaging is the first ultrasonic technique that enables visualisation of pathological cerebral echo contrast enhancement. Because this method identifies deficits of focal contrast enhancement in patients with acute stroke and allows estimation of the final infarct size and clinical prognosis, it may help to select and monitor patients for invasive therapies. ...|$|R
40|$|OPINION STATEMENT Children who {{present with}} acute {{neurological}} symptoms suggestive {{of a stroke}} need immediate clinical assessment and urgent neuroimaging to confirm diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of first choice due to limited sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) for detection of ischaemia. Acute monitoring should include monitoring of blood pressure and body temperature, and neurological observations. Surveillance in a paediatric high dependency or intensive care unit and neurosurgical consultation are mandatory in children with large infarcts at risk of developing <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema</b> or haemorrhagic transformation. Thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment, whilst not currently approved for use in children, may be considered when stroke diagnosis is confirmed within 4. 5 to 6  h, provided there are no contraindications on standard adult criteria. Standard treatment consists of aspirin, but anticoagulation therapy is frequently prescribed in stroke due to cardiac disease and extracranial dissection. Steroids and immunosuppression have a definite place in children with proven vasculitis, but their role in focal arteriopathies is less clear. Decompressive craniotomy {{should be considered in}} children with deteriorating consciousness or signs of raised intracranial pressure...|$|E
40|$|Imaging {{has become}} a {{cornerstone}} of stroke management, translating pathophysiological knowledge to everyday decision-making. Plain computed tomography is widely available and remains the standard for initial assessment: the technique rules out haemorrhage, visualizes the occluding thrombus and identifies early tissue hypodensity and swelling, which have different implications for thrombolysis. Based on evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), however, multimodal imaging is increasingly advocated. Computed tomography perfusion and angiography provide information on the occlusion site, on recanalization and {{on the extent of}} salvageable tissue. Magnetic resonance-based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has exquisite sensitivity for acute ischaemia, however, and there is increasingly robust evidence that DWI combined with perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) and angiography improves functional outcome by selecting appropriate patients for thrombolysis (small DWI lesion but large PWI defect) and by ruling out those who would receive no benefit or might be harmed (very large DWI lesion, no PWI defect), especially beyond the 3 -hour time window. Combined DWI–PWI also helps predict <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema</b> formation and therefore helps guide selection for early brain decompression. Finally, DWI–PWI is increasingly used for patient selection in therapeutic trials. Although further methodological developments are awaited, implementing the individual pathophysiologic diagnosis based on multimodal imaging is already refining indications for thrombolysis and offers new opportunities for management of acute stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|Blackleg {{is caused}} by Clostridium chauvoei, whereas <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema</b> {{is caused by}} C. chauvoei, C. septicum, C. sordellii, C. {{perfringens}} type A, and/or C. novyi type A. Anti-C. chauvoei, anti-C. septicum, anti-C. sordellii and anti-C. novyi type A polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits and purified in a column of DEAE-cellulose. Aliquots of the antisera were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and the remaining {{was used for the}} streptavidin biotin peroxidase technique (SBPT). SBPT was standardized to detect C. chauvoei, C. septicum, C. sordellii and C. novyi type A in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of guinea pigs. SBPT was compared to a fluorescent antibody technique (FAT). Sections and smears of muscle from inoculation area (MIA), heart, liver, spleen and kidney, were obtained for both SBPT and FAT. Cross-reactions between the different Clostridial species were not observed. C. chauvoei and C. septicum were detected in all specimens from the animals inoculated with these microorganisms, while only sections of muscle obtained from all the animals inoculated with C. sordellii and C. novyi type A were positive. The same results observed by the SBPT, were obtained on tissue smears of these microorganisms stained by the FAT. The results indicate that SBPT is suitable for detection of C. chauvoei, C. septicum, C. sordellii and C. novyi type A in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of guinea pigs...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium chauvoei is {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} diseases such as symptomatic coal (blackleg) and <b>malignant</b> <b>oedema</b> in cattle, sheep and many other domestic and wild animals. Vaccines for the control of this and other livestock diseases caused by various species of clostridia are widely used. For vaccine production it is desirable that high cellular density cultures with high immunogenic power are obtained, mainly because immunity to Clostridium chauvoei is generally considered to be antibacterial rather than antitoxic. Consequently, culture conditions have to be adequately monitored and controlled. The aim of this work was to optimise the production of a vaccine against Clostridium chauvoei based on strains IRP- 434, IRP 206, ATCC 10092, ATCC 11957 and LANIP, used by “Empresa Colombiana de Productos Veterinarios”, VECOL, S. A., to determine the culture medium that allows the highest cellular density. Results show that modified clostridium medium allows the highest cellular density production with average values of 31, 5 X 108 cell/ml for the stock IRP 434 and 31, 8 X 108 cell/ml for the stock IRP 206. Once defined the modified clostridium medium, the stock IRP 434,IRP 206 and growth time as the most suitable for optimal biomass production (16  – 48 hours), the lethal activity of the stock (LD 50 = 106. 6, 106. 8) was determined, the immunogenicity was evaluated through a potency test carried out in guinea-pigs. The presence of the flagellar protein was confirmed through the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis technique...|$|E
