During nodal transportation to the extracellular space, the nodal co-receptor captures the nodal precursor in lipid rafts and once in the cell surface, Cripto interacts with the convertases and forms a complex that facilitates the processing of nodal.|$|E

Significant levels of the <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> {{in the absence of}} Rev were localized in the cytoplasm, while very low levels of Gag protein were produced. In the presence of Rev, the levels of mRNA increased by 4 - to 16 -fold, while the Gag protein production increased by 800 -fold. These findings indicated that in addition to promoting nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport, Rev increased the utilization of cytoplasmic viral mRNA. Poly(A) selection and in vitro translation of cytoplasmic gag mRNA verified that the <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the absence of Rev was functional. To analyze the translational defect in the absence of Rev, we examined the association of the cytoplasmic gag mRNA with ribosomes. gag <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the absence of Rev was excluded from polysomes, while gag <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the presence of Rev was associated with polysomes and produced Gag protein. These observations showed that the presence of Rev was required for efficient loading of gag mRNA onto polysomes. This effect required the presence of the RRE on the mRNA. Analysis of <b>mRNAs</b> <b>produced</b> from a rev-minus proviral clone confirmed that the presence of Rev promoted polysomal loading of both gag/pol and vpu/env mRNAs. The localization of gag mRNA was also examined by in situ hybridization. This analysis showed that in the presence of Rev, most of the gag mRNA was found in the cytoplasm, while in the absence of Rev, most of the gag mRNA was found in the nucleus and in the region surrounding the nucleus. These results suggest that a substantial fraction of the gag mRNA is retained in distinct cytoplasmic compartments in the absence and presence of Rev. These findings indicate that the presence of Rev is required along the entire mRNA transport and utilization pathway for the stabilization, correct localization, and efficient translation of RRE-containing mRNAs...|$|R

Regulation of splicing at HIV- 1 3 ′ splice sites (3 ′ss) requires suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts, and positive or negative regulation of splicing occurs through binding of cellular factors to cis-acting splicing regulatory elements. We have previously shown that splicing at HIV- 1 3 ′ss A 2, which produces vpr mRNA and promotes inclusion of HIV- 1 exon 3, is repressed by the hnRNP A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer ESSV. Here we show that ESSV activity downstream of 3 ′ss A 2 is localized to a 16 -nucleotide element within HIV- 1 exon 3. HIV- 1 replication was reduced by 95 % when ESSV was inactivated by mutagenesis. Reduced replication was concomitant with increased inclusion of exon 3 within spliced viral mRNA and decreased accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA, resulting in decreased cell-associated p 55 Gag. Prolonged culture of ESSV mutant viruses resulted in two independent second-site reversions disrupting the splice sites that define exon 3, 3 ′ss A 2 and 5 ′ splice site D 3. Either of these changes restored both HIV- 1 replication and regulated viral splicing. Therefore, inhibition of HIV- 1 3 ′ss A 2 splicing is necessary for HIV- 1 replication...|$|E

To investigate the possibility that p 40 contains a nucleolus targeting sequence in its N-terminal region, COS cells were transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the p 40 N terminus. The localization of this fusion protein in the nucleolus indicated that the N-terminal amino acids of p 40 probably contain a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). To find the structural motifs required for nucleolar localization of p 40, deletion mutants were expressed in COS cells as fusion polypeptides with GFP. We defined a domain of 19 amino acids near the N terminus that contains an arginine-rich subdomain that conforms to other known NoLS.

40|$|In many {{developmental}} systems, {{spatial pattern}} arises from morphogen gradients, which provide positional information for cells {{to determine their}} fate. Typically, diffusion {{is thought to be}} the mechanism responsible for building a morphogen gradient. An alternative mechanism is investigated here. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate how a nondiffusive morphogen concentration gradient can develop in axially growing tissue systems, where growth is due to cell proliferation only. Two distinct cases are considered: in the first, all cell proliferation occurs in a localized zone where active transcription of a morphogen-producing gene occurs, and in the second, cell proliferation is uniformly distributed throughout the tissue, occurring in both the active transcription zone and beyond. A cell containing morphogen <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> the morphogen protein, hence any gradient in mRNA transcripts translates into a corresponding morphogen protein gradient. Proliferation-driven growth gives rise to both advection (the transport term) and dilution (a reaction term). These two key mechanisms determine the resultant mRNA transcript distribution. Using the full range of uniform initial conditions, we show that advection and dilution due to cell proliferation are, in general, sufficient for morphogen gradient formation for both types of axially growing systems. In particular, mRNA transcript degradation is not necessary for gradient formation; it is only necessary with localized proliferation for one special value of the initial concentration. Furthermore, the morphogen concentration decreases with distance away from the transcription zone, except in the case of localize...|$|E

In this model, reverse transcription of <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> cDNA molecules that replace part of the parental gene by homologous recombination. In vivo evidence of reverse transcription of physiologically relevant mRNAs is generally lacking, however, except in genetically engineered cells. Here, we provide in vivo evidence for reverse transcription of the chloroplast psbAmRNA in two naturally occurring species of Chlamydomonas (raudensis and subcaudata) that is based on the presence of spliced cDNAs in both organisms. The psbA cDNAs, which lack the group II intron of the genomic gene, are nearly full length, and the majority of them— though not all—are in the form of RNA–cDNA hybrids. Moreover, the presence in these species of psbA cDNAs is correlated with the loss of an early group I intron from the same psbA gene. The group II intron that interrupts psbA in C. raudensis and C. subcaudata potentially encodes a protein with a reverse transcriptase domain, and the C. raudensis protein was shown to have reverse transcriptase activity in vitro. These results provide strong evidence for reverse transcription of a physiologically important mRNA (psbA) in two species of Chlamydomonas that have also lost an intron from the same gene, possibly through recombination with the cDNA...|$|E

The ndhC and ndhK genes are partially overlapped and cotranscribed in many land plants. The downstream ndhK mRNA possesses 4 possible AUG initiation codons in many dicot plants. By using an efficient {{in vitro translation}} system from tobacco chloroplasts, we defined that the major initiation site of tobacco ndhK mRNAs is the third AUG that is located 4 nt upstream from the ndhC stop codon. Mutation of the ndhC stop codon (UAG) arrested translation of the ndhK cistron. Frameshift of the ndhC coding strand inhibited also translation of the distal cistron. The results indicated that ndhK translation depends on termination of the preceding cistron, namely translational coupling. Surprisingly, removal of the ndhC 5 ′-UTR and its AUG still supported substantial translation of the ndhK cistron. This translation was abolished again by removing the ndhC stop codon. Although translation of the downstream cistron of an overlapping mRNA is generally very low, {{we found that the}} ndhC/K <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> NdhK and NdhC in similar amounts. Based on subunit compositions of the bacterial complex I, the stoichiometry of NdhK and NdhC is suggested to be 1 : 1 in chloroplasts.

40|$|Adult {{skeletal}} muscles have remarkable regenerative capacity. Muscle regeneration {{occurs when}} muscle tissue experiences injury, causing {{a population of}} normally quiescent muscle-resident stem cells, called satellite cells, to become activated. The CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins known as C/EBPs are transcription factors belonging to the bZIP family. Previous work from our lab has identified C/EBPβ as an important negative regulator of myogenesis. C/EBPβ expression is localized to muscle satellite cells and is downregulated upon induction to differentiate, mirroring the loss of Pax 7 expression in early myogenesis. C/EBPβ expression also negatively regulates MyoD protein expression. Leaky ribosomal scanning of the Cebpb <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> three C/EBPβ isoforms: LAP*, LAP and LIP, though the individual role {{of each of these}} isoforms has not been investigated in myoblasts. This thesis focuses on determining the role of each of the C/EBPβ isoforms during skeletal muscle differentiation. Forced expression of the C/EBPβ-LIP isoform in myoblasts led to a decrease in Myf 5, MyoD, and myogenin expression under differentiation conditions when compared to empty vector controls. Further, the fusion of cells was greatly reduced following differentiation. C/EBPβ-LIP expressing cells also demonstrated a growth defect, with pronounced G 1 arrest and features of senescence. In contrast, myoblasts expressing the C/EBPβ-LAP isoform has impaired differentiation, though this was not as pronounced as in C/EBPβ-LIP expressing cells and proliferated normally. While LIP is not normally expressed in primary myoblasts from healthy muscle, the ratio of LIP:LAP was increased in primary myoblasts isolated from mdx mice, an animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These findings suggest that the regulation of C/EBPβ isoform expression could regulate stem cell stamina and may contribute to defects in muscle regeneration in disease...|$|E

Alternative splicing of VEGF <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> two functionally distinct families of proteins, the conventional pro-angiogenic family, VEGFxxxa, and an anti-angiogenic family, VEGFxxxb. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, I investigated the cytoprotective effect of the predominant VEGFxxxb isoform, VEGF 165 b, on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Like its sister isoform VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b was cytoprotective for RPE cells and, hippocampal and DRG neurons against various insults and the underlying mechanism was explored. I investigated the effect of VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b and a VEGF neutralizing antibody on mechanical withdrawal nociceptive behaviour in normal and nerve-injured mice. Key findings were that VEGF isoforms affected nociceptive behaviour in an opposing and isoform-specific manner and the pro-nociceptive effect of VEGF 165 a was dependent the ion channel, transient receptor potential- vanilloid-l (TRPVl). The VEGF isoforms also affected TRPVI channel activity in an opposing and isoform-specific manner in vitro.

While the stoned locus {{is required for}} synaptic-vesicle cycling in neurons, distinct or overlapping synaptic functions of stonedA and stonedB have not been clearly identified. Potential functions of stoned products in nonneuronal cells remain entirely unexplored in vivo. Transgene-based analyses presented here demonstrate that exclusively neuronal expression of a dicistronic stoned cDNA is sufficient for rescue of defects observed in lethal and viable stoned mutants. Significantly, expression of a monocistronic stonedB trangene is sufficient for rescuing various phenotypic deficits of stoned mutants, including those in organismal viability, evoked transmitter release, and synaptotagmin retrieval from the plasma membrane. In contrast, a stonedA transgene does not alleviate any stoned mutant phenotype. Novel phenotypic analyses demonstrate that, in addition to regulation of presynaptic function, stoned is required for regulating normal growth and morphology of the motor terminal; however, this developmental function is also provided by a stonedB transgene. Our data, although most consistent with a hypothesis in which stonedA is a dispensable protein, are limited {{by the absence of}} a true null allele for stoned due to partial restoration of presynaptic stonedA by transgenically provided stonedB.

She was born with bilateral hip dislocations, knee subluxations, and generalised joint hypermobility. Bilateral inguinal herniae and an umbilical hernia were present at birth. Facial features included a depressed nasal bridge with prominent paranasal folds. The skin was soft, moderately hyperelastic, and sagged over the face. Skin fragility and easy bruising were apparent from childhood. Skin wounds healed slowly and with broad, paper thin scars.

40|$|Abstract Background Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal {{proteins}} {{found in}} animals and amoebozoans such as Dictyostelium discoideum. Since {{the identification of}} a second talin gene in vertebrates, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that vertebrate Talin 1 and Talin 2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin 1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin 1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin 2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin <b>mRNA</b> <b>produces</b> two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene. Results We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C. intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin 1 and Talin 2. Conclusion Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution. </p...|$|E

Importantly, magoh also binds to <b>mRNAs</b> <b>produced</b> by splicing upstream (∼ 20 nucleotides) of exon– exon junctions and its binding to mRNA persists after export. These experiments thus reveal specific protein–protein interactions among the proteins of the splicing-dependent mRNP complex and suggest an important role for the highly evolutionarily conserved magoh protein in this complex...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Genetic variation {{is known to}} influence the amount of <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> by a gene. Because molecular machines control mRNA levels of multiple genes, we expect genetic variation in components of these machines would influence multiple genes in a similar fashion. We show that this assumption is correct by using correlation of mRNA levels measured from multiple tissues in mous...|$|R
50|$|Obestatin is encoded by {{the same}} gene that encodes ghrelin, a peptide hormone. The <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> from the GHRL gene has four exons. Five {{products}} of similar structure and function arise: {{the first is the}} 117-amino acid preproghrelin. (It is homologous to promotilin; both are members of the motilin family). It is cleaved to produce proghrelin which is cleaved to produce a 28-amino acid ghrelin (unacylated) and C-ghrelin(acylated). Obestatin is presumed to be cleaved from C-ghrelin.|$|R

RT- PCR conditions were: 2 min at 50 °C, 30 min at 60 °C, and 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 20 s at 92 °C, 1 min at 62 °C. The Ct values obtained by amplification were used to create standard curves for target genes.|$|R
