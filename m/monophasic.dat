25|$|Typically, ADEM {{appears in}} {{children}} following an antigenic challenge and remains <b>monophasic.</b> Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, {{and can also}} be clinically multiphasic.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{allergic}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) is {{an animal}} model of CNS inflammation and demyelination frequently used to investigate potential MS treatments. An acute <b>monophasic</b> illness, EAE {{is far more}} similar to ADEM than MS.|$|E
25|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{also known}} as Devic's disease or Devic's syndrome, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). It can be <b>monophasic</b> or recurrent.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the relapsing form is related to the antiAQP4+ seropositive status and the <b>monophasic</b> form related to its absence Unlike multiple sclerosis, Devic's disease rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have wide {{diversity}} in sleep phenomena. Generally, {{they go through}} periods of alternating non-REM and REM sleep, but these manifest differently. Horses and other herbivorous ungulates can sleep while standing, but must necessarily lie down for REM sleep (which causes muscular atony) for short periods. Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep {{for a few minutes}} at a time. Bats sleep while hanging upside down. Inversely to humans and rats, male armadillos get erections during non-REM sleep. Early mammals engaged in polyphasic sleep, dividing sleep into multiple bouts per day. Higher daily sleep quotas and shorter sleep cycles in polyphasic species as compared to <b>monophasic</b> species, suggest that polyphasic sleep may be a less efficient means of attaining sleep’s benefits. Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns. It follows that the evolution of <b>monophasic</b> sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR.|$|E
25|$|ADEM has {{an abrupt}} onset and a <b>monophasic</b> course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major {{symptoms}} include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially {{the symptoms are}} usually mild, they worsen rapidly {{over the course of}} hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{patients}} with tumors containing mixtures of histological subtypes are usually excluded from clinical trials, {{the properties of}} multiphasic tumors like c-SCLC are much less well understood than those of <b>monophasic</b> tumors. C-SCLC contains both SCLC and NSCLC by definition, and since patients with SCLC and NSCLC are usually treated differently, the lack of good data on c-SCLC means {{there is little evidence}} available with which to form consensus about whether c-SCLC should be treated like SCLC, NSCLC, or uniquely.|$|E
25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. <b>Monophasic</b> sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have nothing better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E
500|$|Other {{diagnostic}} entities {{are often}} {{included in the}} spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, for instance, {{is part of the}} group of conditions now regarded as forms of Miller Fisher syndrome (anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome), as well as a related condition labelled [...] "acute ataxic hypersomnolence" [...] where coordination problems and drowsiness are present but no muscle weakness can be detected. BBE is characterized by the rapid onset of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and disturbance of consciousness, and may be associated with absent or decreased tendon reflexes and as well as Babinski's sign. The course of the disease is usually <b>monophasic,</b> but recurrent episodes have been reported. MRI abnormalities in the brainstem have been reported in 11%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease can}} be <b>monophasic,</b> i.e. a single episode with {{permanent}} remission. [...] However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing {{form of the}} disease with repeated attacks of transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the <b>monophasic</b> form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. [...] On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form {{are more likely to}} have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment is with {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Biphasic defibrillation {{may be better}} than <b>monophasic.</b> The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective. Rates of survival {{among those who are}} out of hospital when the arrhythmia is detected is about 17% while in hospital it is about 46%.|$|E
2500|$|All {{contain an}} estrogen, {{ethinylestradiol}} or mestranol, in varying amounts, {{and one of}} a number of different progestogens. (Regarding the estrogen, the inactive 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol, which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinylestradiol; 50µg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35µg of ethinylestradiol and should not be used when high-dose [...] estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid). They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are <b>monophasic</b> (the same dose of estrogen and progestogen during each of the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle <b>monophasic</b> pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the withdrawal bleeding intervals can be decreased.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very large}} number of {{clinical}} trials have been conducted in [...] "pure" [...] SCLC over the past several decades. As a result, evidence-based sets of guidelines for treating <b>monophasic</b> SCLC are available. While the current set of SCLC treatment guidelines recommend that c-SCLC be treated {{in the same manner as}} [...] "pure" [...] SCLC, they also note that the evidence supporting their recommendation is quite weak. It is likely, then, that the optimum treatment for patients with c-SCLC remains unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{patients}} with <b>monophasic</b> Devic's disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. [...] Among patients with relapsing Devic's disease, 50% have paralysis or blindness within five years. [...] In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. [...] However, the spectrum of Devic's disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{available}} AEDs {{were all of}} a <b>monophasic</b> type, which gave a high-energy shock, up to 360 to 400 joules depending on the model. This caused increased cardiac injury {{and in some cases}} second and third-degree burns around the shock pad sites. [...] Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120 - 200 joules, with each shock moving in an opposite polarity between the pads. [...] This lower-energy waveform has proven more effective in clinical tests, as well as offering a reduced rate of complications and reduced recovery time.|$|E

50|$|As {{in other}} apteronotids, O. {{tamandua}} generates a continuous weak electric field for electrolocation and communication. At 452-605 Hz, the electric organ discharge (EOD) of O. tamandua {{has a much}} lower frequency than most other apteronotids and approaches the frequencies of the sternopygid knifefishes. The EOD is also unusual in that the waveform is <b>monophasic,</b> with a head-negative spike followed by a positive baseline (the EOD of most apteronotids have {{both positive and negative}} spikes). The only other apteronotid known to have a <b>monophasic</b> EOD is the related Sternarchorhamphus muelleri. The <b>monophasic</b> waveform of these two genera is similar to the EOD of a larval Apteronotus, suggesting that it may be a paedomorphic or evolutionarily ancestral trait.|$|E
