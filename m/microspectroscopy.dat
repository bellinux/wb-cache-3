This study aimed at applying complementary vibrational spectroscopy methods to evaluate the cellular impact of two Pt(ii) and Pd(ii) dinuclear chelates with spermine (Pt 2 Spm and Pd 2 Spm), using cisplatin (cis-Pt(NH 3) 2 Cl 2) as a reference compound. Their effects on cellular metabolism were monitored in a human triple-negative metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB- 231) by Raman and synchrotron-radiation infrared <b>microspectroscopies,</b> for different drug concentrations (2 - 8 μM) at 48 h exposure. Multivariate data analysis was applied (unsupervised PCA), unveiling drug- and concentration-dependent effects: apart from discrimination between control and drug-treated cells, a clear separation was obtained for the different agents studied - mononuclear vs. polynuclear, and Pt(ii) vs. Pd(ii). Spectral biomarkers of drug action were identified, as well as the cellular response to the chemotherapeutic insult. The main effect of the tested compounds was found to be on DNA, lipids and proteins, the Pd(ii) agent having a more significant impact on proteins while its Pt(ii) homologue affected the cellular lipid content at lower concentrations, which suggests the occurrence of distinct and unconventional pathways of cytotoxicity for these dinuclear polyamine complexes.

Specifically, we studied Mn–Co–Cu/PP, Mn–Co–Mg/PPy and Mn–Ni–Mg/PPy co-electrodeposits. The Mn–Co–Cu system features the best ORR electrocatalytic activity in terms of electron transfer number, onset potential, half-wave potential and current density. XRF maps and micro-XAS spectra yield compositional and chemical state distributions, contributing unique molecular-level information on the pulse-plating processes. Mn, Ni, Co and Mg exhibit a bimodal distribution consisting of mesoscopic aggregates of micrometric globuli, separated by polymer-rich ridges. Within this common qualitative scenario, the individual systems exhibit quantitatively different chemical distribution patterns, resulting from specific electrokinetic and electrosorption properties of the single components. The electrodeposits consist of Mn 3 +, 4 +-oxide particles, accompanied by combinations of Co 0 /Co 2 +, Ni 0 /Ni 2 + and Cu 0,+/Cu 2 + resulting from the alternance of cathodic and anodic pulses. The formation of highly electroactive Mn 3 +, 4 + in the as-fabricated material is a specific feature of the ternary systems, deriving from synergistic stabilisation brought about by two types of bivalent dopants as well as by galvanic contact to elemental metal; this result represents a considerable improvement in material quality with respect to previously studied Mn/PPy and Mn-based/PPy binaries...|$|R
40|$|In higher plants, {{a network}} of {{vascular}} tissues (the phloem and the xylem), which supply water, minerals and other nutrients, connects the different organs and provides mechanical support for the aerial organs. The xylem and the phloem are two highly specialized conductive tissues. The cell wall surrounding the vascular cells is reinforced by a complex matrix of sugar-derived compounds (i. e. : cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins) and lignin, whose compositions depend on the cell type and developmental stage. For example low lignin and high hemicellulose content characterize phloem cells, while lignin and xylans are enriched in xylem cells. The supply and synthesis of the cell wall precursors take place in specialized parenchyma and fibre cells, which are responsible of the thickening of the associated conductive cell walls. As a consequence phloem and xylem cells represent a sink for consumption and sequestration of carbohydrates, with a competitive allocation of carbon pools between lignin and cellulosic compounds, {{which leads to a}} negative correlation between biomass production and lignin content. To improve our knowledge on these processes, we focus on the carbohydrate components deposited during cell wall formation of phloem and xylem cells using the Arabidopsis thaliana floral stem as a model for carbon allocation. Our investigations, by label-free Synchrotron FT-IR, Raman and deep ultra violet <b>microspectroscopies,</b> of the cell wall composition and the cytosolic content of the different xylem and phloem cell types will be presented, using the floral stem of both Arabidopsis wild-type plants and mutants affected in sugar homeostasis...|$|R

30|$|Four {{brightly colored}} calligraphic prints from the “Poem” series (1970 / 71) by Japanese artist Haku Maki (1924 – 2000) were {{examined}} using multiple light-based analytical techniques {{in an effort}} to address conservation concerns regarding these artworks. A distracting white haze on the surface of some of the prints was determined by light microscopy and infrared microanalysis to be fungal mycelium from an inactive mold infestation that occurred prior to the artwork’s acquisition by the museum. Pigment analysis by Raman, X-ray fluorescence, and infrared <b>microspectroscopies</b> identified the artist’s palette as containing common printing ink colors such as aniline black (PBk 1), carbon black (PBk 7), phthalocyanine blue (PB 15), Prussian blue (PB 27), ultramarine blue (PB 29), molybdate orange (PR 104), chrome yellow (PY 34), barium yellow (PY 31), viridian (PG 17), barium sulphate (PW 21), and synthetic organic red pigments (PR 3, PR 22, PR 48 : 3). Although aniline black and molybdate orange are common industrial pigments, reference vibrational spectra to assist in their identification have not appeared previously in the conservation literature. Moreover, this investigation includes to the authors’ knowledge the first published identification of these pigments in a work of fine art. Haku Maki’s unique ‘cement-on-woodblock’ printing technique in combination with his vibrant palette creates dynamic, embossed effects in these prints. However, lightfastness testing using a microfade tester identified the potential for light-based damage to the artwork, in some instances showing poorer lightfastness for colors reported to be stable pigments and greater stability than anticipated for others. These analyses are the first objective study of this innovative artist’s material choices, and they enhance our understanding of his printing technique while helping to determine the proper stewardship protocols to protect his artistic legacy.|$|R
40|$|Wall {{structure}} has been analysed {{by a process}} of careful demolition, in which chemical extractants are used to remove specific polymers for sugar and linkage analysis, gel-permeation or ion-exchange chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sequence-dependent endoglycanases cleave certain polysaccharides into oligomers that can be sequenced completely and give {{a clear picture of}} the repetitive units used to make fundamental polymers. We have also developed and adapted new chemical procedures and pulse-labelling techniques to give more information on the ways that wall polymers are subtly modified during growth. In this report, we review these conventional means of carbohydrate analyses together with newer methods of selective enzymic hydrolysis, separation of large oligosaccharides by high pH anion-exchange chromatography, and detection of molecular mass of several thousand daltons by electrospray mass spectrometry. These new technologies have already given much valuable information about the polymeric building blocks, but little information on how these polymers are arranged in space. For this, we adapted new cryopreservation techniques for electron microscopy that can image the wall in as close to the in vivo state as possible. In addition to defining anomeric linkages and linkage structures in preparations of native polymers, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also determine the relative mobility of particular polymers within the structure of hydrated cell walls. The generation of antibodies to particular cell wall epitopes has enabled us to define architectural differences among species, among tissue types, and even among domains within a single wall.

40|$|Cylindrical or spherical {{catalyst}} {{bodies with}} sizes ranging from tens of micrometers {{to a few}} millimeters have {{a wide variety of}} industrial applications. They are crucial in the oil refining industry and in the manufacture of bulk and fine chemicals. Their stability, activity, and selectivity are largely dependent on their preparation; thus, achieving the optimum catalyst requires a perfect understanding of the physicochemical processes occurring in a catalyst body during its synthesis. The ultimate goal of the catalyst researcher is to visualize these physicochemical processes as the catalyst is being prepared and without interfering with the system. In order to understand this chemistry and improve catalyst design, researchers need better, less invasive tools to observe this chemistry as it occurs, from the first stages in contact with a precursor all the way through its synthesis. In this Account, we provide an overview of the recent advances in the development of space- and time-resolved spectroscopic methods, from invasive techniques to noninvasive ones, to image the physicochemical processes taking place during the preparation of catalyst bodies. Although several preparation methods are available to produce catalyst bodies, the most common method used in industry is the incipient wetness impregnation. It is the most common method used in industry because it is simple and costeffective. This method consists of three main steps each of which has {{an important role in the}} design of a catalytic material: pore volume impregnation, drying, and thermal treatment. During the impregnation step, the interface between the support surface and the precursor of the active phase at the solid-liquid interface is where the critical synthetic chemistry occurs. Gas-solid and solid-solid interfaces are critical during the drying and thermal treatment steps. Because of the length scale of these catalyst bodies, the interfacial chemistry that occurs during preparation is space-dependent. Different processes occurring in the core or in the outer rim of the catalytic solid are enhanced by several factors, such as the impregnation solution pH, the metal ion concentration, the presence of organic additives, and the temperature gradients inside the body. Invasive methods for studying the molecular nature of the metal-ion species during the preparation of catalyst bodies include Raman, UV-vis-NIR, and IR <b>microspectroscopies.</b> Noninvasive techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Synchrotron-based techniques such as tomographic energy dispersive diffraction imaging (TEDDI) and X-ray microtomography for noninvasive characterization are also evaluated...|$|R
