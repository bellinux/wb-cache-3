5000|$|Root has {{previously}} used Jackson, Charvel, PRS and Maverick guitars. He {{was impressed with}} the quality of Fender and contacted Alex Perez. They used the Fender Showmaster as an idea to build on. In July 2007, Fender released a Jim Root Signature Fender Telecaster guitar. The guitar comes in two models - one with a black finish and maple fingerboard and the other in a white finish with an ebony fingerboard. It differs from many Fender guitars. The guitar has a mahogany body, nitro-lacquer finish, dual humbuckers, a single master volume, an ebony fingerboard and a 12" [...] neck radius. It has traits of a Gibson guitar and a Fender guitar. Root said it's a mix of classic and modern. The guitar's heel is shaved so the player can access higher frets. Root chose a nitro-lacquer finish because it tends to wear quicker than the normal polyurethane finish. The guitar comes with a SKB <b>molded</b> <b>case</b> with a blood red plush interior. Root uses EMG active pickups. This guitar is made in Mexico while his signature Stratocasters are made in America. The retail price is $1,469.99.More recently they have released a Squier version of the Telecaster with passive solid-covered humbuckers.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, the coal mining {{industry}} has made {{significant changes in the}} design of longwall mining systems to make them more productive. Some changes, such as increasing the length of the coal faces and increasing the capacity of the face conveyors, have resulted in problems with achieving sufficient motor torque to start and operate the longwall face conveyors.

40|$|Soldering of <b>molded</b> <b>case</b> {{tantalum}} capacitors {{can result}} in damage to Ta 205 dielectric and first turn-on failures due to thermo-mechanical stresses caused by CTE mismatch between materials used in the capacitors. It is also known that presence of moisture might cause damage to plastic cases due to the pop-corning effect. However, there are only scarce literature data {{on the effect of}} moisture content on the probability of post-soldering electrical failures. In this work, that is based on a case history, different groups of similar types of CWR tantalum capacitors from two lots were prepared for soldering by bake, moisture saturation, and longterm storage at room conditions. Results of the testing showed that both factors: initial quality of the lot, and preconditioning affect the probability of failures. Baking before soldering was shown to be effective to prevent failures even in lots susceptible to pop-corning damage. Mechanism of failures is discussed and recommendations for pre-soldering bake are suggested based on analysis of moisture characteristics of materials used in the capacitors' design...|$|E
40|$|Polymer cathode {{tantalum}} capacitors {{have lower}} ESR (equivalent series resistance) {{compared to other}} types of tantalum capacitors {{and for this reason}} have gained popularity in the electronics design community. Their use allows improved performance of power supply systems along with substantial reduction of size and weight of the components used. However, these parts have poor thermal stability and can degrade in humid environments. Polymer hermetically sealed (PHS) capacitors avoid problems related to environmental degradation of <b>molded</b> <b>case</b> parts and can potentially replace current wet and solid hermetically sealed capacitors. In this work, PHS capacitors manufactured per DLA LAM DWG# 13030 are evaluated for space applications. Several lots of capacitors manufactured over period from 2010 to 2014 were tested for the consistency of performance, electrical and thermal characteristics, highly accelerated life testing, and robustness under reverse bias and random vibration conditions. Special attention was given to analysis of leakage currents and the effect of long-term high temperature storage on capacitors in as is condition and after hermeticity loss. The results show that PHS capacitors might be especially effective for low-temperature applications or for system requiring a cold start-up. Additional screening and qualification testing have been recommended to assure the necessary quality of capacitors for space projects...|$|E
