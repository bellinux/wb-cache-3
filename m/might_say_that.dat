25|$|In {{the field}} of physics, the {{adjective}} covariant is often used informally as a synonym for invariant. For example, the Schrödinger equation does not keep its written form under the coordinate transformations of special relativity. Thus, a physicist <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Schrödinger equation is not covariant. In contrast, the Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation do keep their written form under these coordinate transformations. Thus, a physicist <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these equations are covariant.|$|E

25|$|The derived {{category}} {{allows us}} to encapsulate all derived functors RnF in one functor, namely the so-called total derived functor RF: D+(A) → D+(B). It is the following composition: D+(A) ≅ K+(Inj(A)) → K+(B) → D+(B), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors {{are related to the}} total one via RnF(X) = Hn(RF(X)). One <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes.|$|E

Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals.|$|E
25|$|While some <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Nakamichi {{violated}} the tape recording standards {{to achieve the}} highest dynamics possible, producing non-compatible cassettes for playback on other machines, {{the reasons for this}} are more complex than they appear on the surface. Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4dB ambiguity at 16kHz. Technically, both camps in this debate were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response was provided above 12.5kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5kHz are considered optional. But also Nakamichi is not error-prone. Decreasing noise at 16kHz also decreases the maximum signal level at 16kHz, the HighFrequency-Dynamics stay almost constant.|$|E
25|$|Surrealists {{have also}} drawn on sources as {{seemingly}} diverse as Clark Ashton Smith, Montague Summers, Horace Walpole, Fantômas, The Residents, Bugs Bunny, comic strips, the obscure poet Samuel Greenberg and the hobo writer and humourist T-Bone Slim. One <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Surrealist strands {{may be found}} in movements such as Free Jazz (Don Cherry, Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions. Thought of as the effort of humanity to liberate imagination as an act of insurrection against society, Surrealism finds precedents in the alchemists, possibly Dante, Hieronymus Bosch, Marquis de Sade, Charles Fourier, Comte de Lautreamont and Arthur Rimbaud.|$|E

25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E

One <b>might</b> also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was a subject as to talking on which the choice certainly ought to have been left to himself.

500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and you <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he has been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations {{have been allowed to}} deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

Mike Ragogna with The Huffington Post wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. {{and two of}} the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen's E Street Band, has said: [...] "Astral Weeks was like a religion to us." [...] According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, [...] "from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed 'the Van Morrison'." [...] In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote [...] "It was almost as if Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later they <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks, but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was like anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Addition {{of a text}} can {{effectively}} change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of Franz Liszt. Both the Faust and Dante symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies. However, while Liszt authority Humphrey Searle asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up Faust and makes it complete, another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus {{to the point of}} meriting a different interpretation of the work itself. According to Shulstad, [...] "Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an ... orchestral peroration in C major, based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. One <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination". When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a [...] "Chorus mysticus", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's Faust. The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. [...] "With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text", Shulstad writes, [...] "the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption".|$|E

2500|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} appear {{prima facie}} more {{compatible with the}} philosophical theory of representationalism. [...] According to this theory, the immediate objects of experience when we are perceiving the world normally are representations of the world, rather than the world itself. [...] These representations have been variously called sense-data or images. In {{the case of an}} apparitional experience one <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the subject is aware of sense-data or images which happen not to correspond to, or represent, the external world in the normal way.|$|E
2500|$|In languages, {{modality}} {{deals with}} the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the voltage amplifier, the output voltage βVout of the {{feedback}} network is applied in series and with an opposite polarity to the input voltage Vx travelling over the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are the same).
