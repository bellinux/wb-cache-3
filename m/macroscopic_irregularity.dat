Based on the casting process analysis and gating system design, the numerical simulation of gray iron butterfly valve was done by hydrodynamic software Flow- 3 D to obtain its optimal process scheme. According to the simulation results including flow field, temperature field and defect distribution, the merits and faults of designed schemes were investigated and then the feasible gating system was proposed. The results showed that, compared with top or intermediate casting, when adopting bottom casting, steady flow of molten metal and reasonable temperature distribution could be achieved. And workpiece defects mainly distributed in riser. The predicted results are in good agreement with practical ones...|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} {{laboratory experiments}} of granular streams using poly-dispersed glass beads with median diameters of 55  μm (50  μm glass beads) and 93  μm (100  μm glass beads), alumina particles, and silica sand grains {{to investigate the}} formation conditions of agglomerates in granular streams. The glass beads were spherical, whereas the alumina particles and silica sand grains had irregular, non-spherical shapes. We measured the adhesion of the particles using a centrifugal separation method. The 50  μm glass beads had a relatively smaller range of adhesion, which was closer to theoretical expectations than the other particles. The other particles showed discrepancies of orders of magnitude from the theoretical values of perfect spheres, {{as well as a}} large spread in the values, which was likely due to the microscopic roughness of the particle surfaces, in addition to the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>irregularity</b> in their shape. Based on the measured adhesion, the critical collision velocity for agglomerates of these particles was up to a few centimeter per second, while the typical horizontal velocity of the particles just below the aperture of the funnel was approximately 1  cm s−[*] 1.|$|E
40|$|CASE 1 : Following 2 {{years of}} rectal blood loss, a 31 -year-old male was {{diagnosed}} with ulcerative pancolitis in 1978. Initial treatment consisted of both topical and systemic 5 -aminosalicylic acids [5 -ASAs], and remission was achieved. In both 1984 and 1986 he was hospitalised due to exacerbations necessitating treatment with intravenous corticosteroids. The following years went well, without disease activity, under treatment with 5 -ASA. In 1997, {{at the age of}} 50 years, a surveillance colonoscopy showed a stenotic process with a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the sigmoid region. Histology revealed at least high-grade dysplasia [HGD] and signs of an invasive growth pattern which could indicate colorectal cancer [CRC]. The patient underwent restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [IPAA]. Histology of the resection specimen confirmed active inflammation in the colon and rectum and a carcinoma in situ was identified in the sigmoid colon without invasive growth. This patient did not have significant comorbidities-for example primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]-and the CRC family history was negative. What pouch surveillance strategy should be recommended? CASE 2 : A 34 -year-old man presented at our inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] centre with ulcerative proctitis. Ten years later, after an initially mild disease course, his disease progressed to a pancolitis. An 11 -year period with multiple exacerbations [on average every 2 year, including hospitalisation] followed and treatment consisted of topical and systemic 5 -ASAs with intermittent corticosteroids. In 1998, at the age of 65 years, a two-stage restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA was performed due to disease activity refractory to systemic corticosteroids. The colectomy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of ulcerative pancolitis without evidence for colorectal dysplasia or carcinoma. Other than steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, this patient had no comorbidities. His father died from CRC at unknown age. What pouch surveillance strategy should be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} {{years there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the development of robotic technologies for attaching to, grasping and manipulating a wide range of objects, regardless of their shape, material and the presence of specific features on their surface. This issue has become of particular interest in the space field as regards the execution of ‘on-orbit servicing’ operations and the active removal of space debris, where the presence of non-cooperative objects requests the employment of grasping systems that are effective when the properties of the target object are unknown. In this framework, the paper deals with the study of an interface to be employed in a gripping device where morphing and adhesive capabilities are combined in a single smart system. On one hand, the morphing behaviour is provided by a foam support that could be easily deformed at ambient temperature, enhancing a good compliance with the target surface, even when <b>macroscopic</b> <b>irregularities</b> that obstacle the contact over the entire surface, like screws, nuts or reinforcements, are present. On the other hand, the adhesion is provided by means of electrostatic forces (electro-adhesion) generated when a high voltage, on the order of 1 – 5 kV, is applied to a pair of electrodes embedded inside an insulating material. Two different solutions are considered to make an electro-adhesive layer with flexible electrodes: one consists of using a conductive fabric, from which the electrodes are cut with the desired geometry; the second one consist of fabricating a conductive silicone by mixing 20 % conductive particles (carbon black particles) in a 10 : 1 PDMS silicone matrix. In both cases, the electrodes are embedded inside an insulating layer of TC- 5005. The electro-adhesive layer obtained is then bonded with the foam support. Two sets of tests are performed as regards the adhesion capabilities and the morphing behaviour, aiming to evaluate (1) the force level reached with the two different types of electrodes and (2) the morphing capabilities of the entire substrate, i. e. its ability to conform to objects of different shapes or with <b>macroscopic</b> <b>irregularities</b> on the surface, and to determine how the compliance aids the adhesion behaviour...|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo soil {{reflectance}} {{model has}} been developed to study the effect of <b>macroscopic</b> surface <b>irregularities</b> larger than the wavelength of incident flux. The model treats incoherent multiple scattering from Lambertian facets distributed on a periodic surface. Resulting bidirectional reflectance distribution functions are non-Lambertian and compare well with experimental trends reported in the literature. Examples showing the coupling of the Monte Carlo soil model to an adding bidirectional canopy of reflectance model are also given...|$|R
40|$|R-band CCD {{photometry}} of 2060 {{was carried}} out on nine nights in Nov. and Dec. 1986. The rotation period is 5. 9181 + or - 0. 0003 hr and the peak to peak lightcurve amplitude is 0. 088 + or - 0. 0003 mag. Photometric parameters are H sub R = 6. 24 + or - 0. 02 mag and G sub R = + or - 0. 15, though formal errors may not be realistic. The lightcurve has two pairs of extrema, but its asymmetry, {{as evidenced by the}} presence of significant odd Fourier harmonics, suggests <b>macroscopic</b> surface <b>irregularities</b> and/or the presence of some large scale albedo variegation. The observational rms residual is + or - 0. 015 mag. On time scales from minutes to days there is no evidence for nonperiodic (cometary) brightness changes at the level of a few millimagnitudes...|$|R

Signs of {{pathogenicity}} were quantified in cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus, living adjacent (Birchy Cove and Summerside) to a non-chlorinated {{pulp and}} paper mill in the Humber River Estuary, western Newfoundland, compared with a reference site (Gillams) approximately 12 kilometers downstream of effluent outfall(s). Several bioindicators of pulp toxicity were utilized, including condition factor, organ somatic indices, <b>macroscopic</b> and microscopic <b>irregularities,</b> parasitofauna, age structure and induction of hepatic mixed function oxygenases. Condition factors were nonsignificant among sites in contrast to exaggerated growth at impact sites compared to Gillams' fish. Male and female gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) and histological analyses suggested a delay in spawning and/or gametogenesis of impacted fish versus mature, reference cunner. However, consideration of the short reproductive cycle of this species {{it is possible that}} polluted fish may have been sampled {{at the beginning of the}} maturational phase in comparison to Gillams' counterparts. Hepatosomatic indices (HSIs) were exaggerated at polluted sites and may reflect proliferation of hepatic smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). This was consistent with significant induction of 7 ethoxyresorufin deethylase at the Birchy Cove site, since SER is the site of both Phase-I and Phase-II enzymes. However, increased liver size may be attributed to vitellogenesis of female fish. No consistent differences were observed in visceralsomatic indices (VSIs), but splenosomatic indices (SSIs) were, in general, larger at Birchy Cove and Summerside than at Gillams. Percent splenic deposits did not demonstrate site significance. Histological surveys indicated more pronounced tissue pathology at Birchy Cove and Summerside. Quantification of Cryptocotyle lingua did not establish any site-specific trends, however, enteric parasitization was considerably more intense at the reference site compared to Birchy Cove and Summerside, possibly due to voiding or reduced proliferation in effluent-exposed cunner. Otolith analysis (1994) showed the mean age of the Gillams' sample to be significantly greater than at polluted sites. Chronic stress observed in cunners suggests that evidence of pulp-induced toxicity in this population is not necessarily due to chlorine constituents...|$|R
