5|$|The {{stabilization}} policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling gerontocracy, and political corruption became a normal phenomenon. Brezhnev, however, never initiated any large-scale anti-corruption campaigns. Due {{to the large}} <b>military</b> <b>buildup</b> of the 1960s, the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule. The era ended with Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{government}} spending {{often lead to}} significant shifts in demand across sectors. This paper analyzes the effects of sector-specific changes {{in government}} spending in a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model in which the reallocation of capital across sectors is costly. The two-sector model leads to a richer array of possible responses of aggregate variables than the one-sector model. The empirical part of the paper estimates the effects of <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> {{on a variety of}} macroeconomic variables using a new measure of military shocks. The behavior of macroeconomic aggregates is consistent with the predictions of a multi-sector neoclassical model. In particular, consumption, real product wages and manufacturing productivity fall in response to exogenous <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> in the post-World War II United States. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{macroeconomic}} consequences of large <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> using a New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) approach that combines nominal rigidities within imperfectly competitive goods and labour markets. They {{show that the}} predictions of the NNS framework generally {{are consistent with the}} sign, timing, and magnitude of how hours worked, after-tax real wages, and output actually respond to an upsurge in military purchases. The key factors leading to these findings are: (i) variations in the ratio of price to marginal cost resulting from nominal-price inflexibilities, (ii) staggered nominal-wage setting, and (iii) time-varying marginal tax rates. Unlike the standard neoclassical model, the NNS framework successfully explains the macroeconomic effects of <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> when taxes are distortionary.

5|$|After Reagan's <b>military</b> <b>buildup,</b> the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further {{building}} its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Chamberlin became Assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of War Department General Staff. At this time, the United States was {{embarking on}} a <b>military</b> <b>buildup</b> in {{response}} to a worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses.

5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} <b>military</b> <b>buildup</b> in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the United States had {{relied on the}} {{qualitative}} superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's <b>military</b> <b>buildup,</b> their large military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, {{which resulted in a}} drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during Gorbachev's tenure.|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of the}} century. During Japan's <b>military</b> <b>buildup</b> in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} an important set of linked {{questions about the}} relationship between military spending and society. A little explored dynamic of this complex picture is a potential feedback relationship between societal instability and military spending. We explore related questions here: first, what is the impact of internal societal instability on military spending, and then what is the corresponding impact of military spending on society. Most traditional theories have considered military spending to be a function of either external threat or economic capacity. While these factors matter, scholars fail to investigate the important linkage between the issue of societal stability and cohesion on one hand, and rapid <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> and defense burdens on the other. We examine the causes of rapid <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> and defense burdens and then investigate the impact of accelerating military spending on domestic economic growth. Overall we show an important linkage between social stability and military spending. We are also able to demonstrate that large defense burdens are, in fact, harmful for growth suggesting there is more to the relationship between military spending and social stability than most scholars realize...|$|R
2500|$|Following the [...] Allies' {{victory over}} Germany and Japan in 1945, the Soviet Union became the sole superpower rival to the United States.

The complexities of nuclear strategy and the debates surrounding them helped produce a new group of 'defense intellectuals' and think tanks, such as the Rand Corporation (where Kahn, among others, worked).|$|R
5|$|Appointed to {{the rank}} of {{lieutenant}} colonel, Định began to stockpile foodstuffs, manufacture weapons, and recruit forces from the populace with the help of officers from the imperial army. His forces grew to around 6,000 men by June 1861. The French began to report that junks from Singapore and Hong Kong had arrived in Gò Công with shipments of European-made weapons. Định's forces began inflicting substantial damage on the European troops, largely because of their intimate knowledge of the terrain, skill in hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, and support from the local villagers. Định's men focused on chasing French soldiers around the countryside and attacking military installations that were left undefended as a consequence of their guerrilla pursuit. Learning of Định's role in support of the Nguyễn dynasty's call for popular resistance, Tự Đức promoted him {{to the rank}} of lieutenant colonel for the Gia Định region. Later in 1861, the imperial regulars were defeated at Biên Hòa, and the commanding Vietnamese officers were ordered by the royal authorities to meet Định at Tan Hoa to develop a plan for retaking Biên Hòa. As a result, the number of troops under Định's direct authority grew. Early in 1862, the Nguyễn court granted Định command of all the southern nghĩa quân (righteous soldiers), the term that Huế used for the partisans. Định continued to lead raids on enemy forces from his base in Gò Công. Friction developed between the regular army and Định's partisans as to whether to stage aggressive sorties from Tan Hoa, as was Định's strategy, or to bide their time and engage in <b>military</b> <b>buildup.</b>|$|E

40|$|Most economists {{would agree}} that a hike in the federal funds rate will cause some {{slowdown}} in growth and in‡ation, and {{that the bulk of}} the empirical evidence is consistent with this statement. But perfectly reasonable economists can and do disagree even on the basic e¤ects of a shock to government spending on goods and services: neoclassical models predict that in general private consumption and the real wage will fall, while some neo-keyenesian models predict the opposite. This paper discusses alternative time series methodologies to identify government spending shocks and to estimate their e¤ects. Applying these methodologies to data from the US and three other OECD countries provides little evidence in favor of the neoclassical predictions. Using the US input-output tables, the paper then turns to industry-level evidence around two major <b>military</b> <b>buildups</b> to shed light on the e¤ects of government spending shocks...|$|R

40|$|The steps-to-war theory {{suggests}} that power politics strategies, such as alliance formation, <b>military</b> <b>buildups,</b> hardliner domestic actors, and aggressive crisis bargaining, often have the unintended consequence of escalating a crisis to war.

This paper questions if the steps-to-war theory can explain wars in a region where one might not expect power politics methods to be in operation. I first test the theory statistically by using a sample of only African dyads and then employ a structured comparison and process-tracing methods to examine the steps taken prior to two African wars, the Ogaden War (1977 – 1978) and the Ugandan-Tanzanian War (1978 – 1979). This research is unable to falsify the theory in the Africa region, although the theory does require modifications in that the actions of rebel groups are important in motivating territorial demands and arms acquisitions in the region...|$|R
