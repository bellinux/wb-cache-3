Extensive crystallisation driven by CO 2 fluxing is responsible for isobaric fractionation of parental basanite magmas close to their source depth. Magma deeper than 4 kbar equilibrates under vapour-buffered conditions. At shallower depths, CO 2 -rich fluids accumulate and are then released either via convection-driven, open-system gas loss or as closed-system slugs that ascend and result in Strombolian eruptions in the lava lake.

We find that within a pressure range between 100 MPa and 50 MPa (∼ 3. 6 km and ∼ 1. 8 km depth respectively) vesiculating magma ascending within the conduit becomes permeable to gas flow and a transition from closed- to open-system degassing takes place.

The development of abatement techniques for the reduction of emissions needs for accurate knowledge about their magnitude. Emission measurement techniques arise then as a key issue. The development <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> techniques considering not only the accuracy of the results but also the optimization of resources is needed. In this sense, in this thesis a tool and three options for the rationalization on the use of resources when measuring airborne emissions are investigated. The tool is the uncertainty analysis and the three options are: downscaling <b>measurements,</b> indirect <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> airflow rates and reduction of sampling rates. In this thesis, theoretical and practical studies were conducted to determine the suitability of these techniques to obtain reliable data from more rational measurements on airborne emissions. Firstly, an uncertainty model was developed in order to assess the trustworthiness of the results when determining N 2 and N 2 O {{emissions from}} a biological scrubber using a combined N-balance in air and water. This model was later partially validated throughout an experimental work in a chemical scrubber. The uncertainty model and the experimental work agreed in the key results of both studies, finding that N-balances were not successful for the proposed aims. Secondly, a flux chamber for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from rabbits was designed and built. A measuring protocol for <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from both animals and their manure was also developed. This chamber was later used to determine the CO 2 emission rate from fattening rabbits during the whole fattening cycle. Using this CO 2 emission rate from fattening rabbits, the carbon dioxide balance was tested as an option to determine the ventilation rate from fattening rabbit houses. The results of these balances were compared with direct <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> ventilation rates finding no statistical differences. Finally, the effect of reducing sampling when measuring ammonia emissions from livestock facilities was evaluated. Emissions calculated using semi-continuous <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> NH 3 concentrations and airflow rates were compared with emissions calculated on 24 -hour average values for these parameters. The error committed with these low time-resolution measurements resulted to be low in comparison with other error sources committed when measuring emissions from livestock facilities. The main conclusion of this work is that there are available techniques that allow optimizing the use <b>of</b> resources <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> processes, by keeping the accuracy of the results.

40|$|With a {{share of}} about 40 to 50 %, wooden {{sleepers}} are widely used across Europe on railways. Beside wood benefits on this application (CO 2 storage, technical advantages, etc [...] ), wooden sleepers also {{have a negative impact}} on the environment because of the preservative treatment that contains carcinogenic compounds. Classified as hazardous waste when removed, the valorization of the 0. 5 to 1 million tons per year is under incineration directive. The lack of environmental effective solution and the geographical dispersion of the stocks opened the way for gasification process. XYLOWATT's NOTAR® gasification technology showed its ability to handle this type of contaminated material. This paper details the experiments based on <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> on a pilot unit of 100 kW LHV 100 % fueled with used railway sleepers. Specific design of the reactor leads to high temperatures and allows destruction of the major part of organic compounds. High metallic compounds levels are managed through the temperature drop in the reduction zone as well as passing through the gas conditioning unit, preventing the release to the environment. Comparison of air emissions with incineration emission value limits demonstrated the effectiveness and environmental benefits when used railway sleepers are valorized with XYLOWATT's NOTAR® gasification process...|$|R
40|$|International audienceData from volcano-monitoring studies {{constitute}} the only scientifically valid basis for short-term forecasts {{of a future}} eruption, or of possible changes during an ongoing eruption. Thus, in any effective hazards-mitigation program, a basic strategy in reducing volcano risk is the initiation or augmentation of volcano monitoring at historically active volcanoes and also at geologically young, but presently dormant, volcanoes with potential for reactivation. Beginning with the 1980 s, substantial progress in volcano-monitoring techniques and networks ? ground-based as well space-based ? has been achieved. Although some geochemical monitoring techniques (e. g., remote <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> volcanic <b>gas</b> <b>emissions)</b> are being increasingly applied and show considerable promise, seismic and geodetic methods to date remain the techniques of choice and are the most widely used. Availability of comprehensive volcano-monitoring data was a decisive factor in the successful scientific and governmental responses to the reawakening of Mount St. elens (Washington, USA) in 1980 and, more recently, to the powerful explosive eruptions at Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines) in 1991. However, even with the ever-improving state-of-the-art in volcano monitoring and predictive capability, the Mount St. Helens and Pinatubo case histories unfortunately still represent the exceptions, rather than the rule, in successfully forecasting the most likely outcome of volcano unrest...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present {{simultaneous}} <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> {{and solid}} <b>emissions</b> from Strombolian explosions acquired on Stromboli volcano on 30 September 2012 using an SO 2 camera and an infrared camera. We find no {{significant correlation between}} solid and gas masses, consistent with the postulated independence of the processes controlling bubble film rupture and gas slug mass, which determine emitted solid and gas masses respectively. Our observations demonstrate the utility of simultaneous multi-parametric imaging of volcanic events at different wavelengths to elucidate the relationships between disparate volcanic processes. We also further demonstrate {{the utility of the}} SO 2 camera in quantifying explosion dynamics, and that by combining ultra violet camera images and spectral measurements we are able to image the spatial distribution of absorbance by SO 2 in volcanic plumes and, crucially, to calibrate the images to total SO 2 masses while compensating for light dilution effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to contribute to the knowledge concerning the abatement <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from livestock production. Investigations regarding the choice of sampling locations for <b>gas</b> concentration <b>measurements,</b> quantification <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and the factors that affect <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> were conducted. NH₃, CH₄, CO₂ and N₂O emissions were measured from two naturally ventilated buildings for dairy cows and from a mechanically ventilated building for fattening pigs. Animal activity, temperature and humidity were also measured. Gas and odour emissions from manure samples with and without the addition of wood shavings were measured in a flux chamber at different air and manure temperatures. Significant differences existed in the mean concentrations <b>of</b> all the <b>gases</b> at various indoor sampling locations in a naturally ventilated building for dairy cows. The differences in gas concentrations between various sampling locations were much smaller for long-term, relative to short-term, measurements, suggesting that a single sampling location during long-term measurements may generate representative data. Decreasing daily animal activity was associated with increasing pig weight, and with increasing air temperatures for the cows. Diurnal variations in <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> were related to feeding/cleaning routines and to animal activity. Daily emissions from the pig building increased with pig weight and temperature. Air temperature was more important than cow activity for daily NH₃ emissions while cow activity was more important than air temperatures for daily CH₄ emissions. Reducing manure temperatures and increasing manure carbon-to-nitrogen ratio are potential NH₃ abatement techniques. However, low air temperatures may increase cow activity which may in turn increase CH₄ emissions. Increasing the frequency of manure removal from the floor and from animal buildings reduces indoor <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> most <b>gases.</b> Low N₂O <b>emissions</b> were measured from the buildings in this study; hence the use of liquid manure systems might reduce N₂O emissions...|$|R
40|$|Volatiles carry crucial {{information}} on pre- to sin-eruptive processes at active volcanoes. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> rates (crater plumes, fumaroles, diffuse soil degassing) therefore improve {{our understanding of}} degassing processes and subsurface magmatic and hydrothermal conditions, and contribute to eruption forecasting. Recent technological developments in spectroscopy have allowed, over the last 30 years, the remote sensing of magmatic volatile emissions from quiescent and erupting degassing volcanoes. These data-sets have contributed to discovering cyclic gas flux components due to periodic magma supply and replenishment in magma storage zones, and/or timescales of magma migration (and degassing) within the feeding conduit systems of volcanoes (chapter 2). In spite of these relevant achievements, a number of magmatic degassing processes have remained elusive to measure, as they occur {{at a faster rate}} than the time resolution of most available spectroscopic techniques. In this study, I take advantage of a novel technique - the UV camera (chapter 3) - to image SO 2 emissions from the Italian volcanoes with improved high temporal resolution. The UV camera heralds the much awaited prospect of capturing transient (≤ tens of seconds) volcanic gas-driven phenomena, such as Strombolian explosions and puffing. Here, this technique has been updated to a new configuration (dual-camera system), which combines higher temporal resolution (0. 5 - 1. 2 Hz) and improved accuracy relative to the single-camera setup. During the first year of this PhD, the methodology has been extensively tested and improved, whilst developing a user-friendly control software (Vulcamera) and a calibration technique (in tandem DOAS-SO 2 quartz cells calibration), which simplify instrument deployment, acquisition and data analysis (chapter 4). The results of the volcano applications of the UV camera are described in chapter 5. A first application (chapter 5. 2) was focused on SO 2 gas flux measurements at individual fumaroles from the La Fossa crater (Vulcano island, Italy) fumarolic field. There, the dual- UV camera technique allowed the simultaneous imaging of multiple-source emissions, discriminating between SO 2 contributions from the four main fumarolic areas. The UV camera-derived individual fumarole SO 2 fluxes have been used in tandem with MultiGASderived gas/SO 2 molar ratios to accurately assess CO 2, H 2 O, and H 2 S fluxes. Results highlight a factor 2 increase in CO 2 and H 2 O degassing during the La Fossa crater degassing/heating unrest event of November-December 2009. Bubbles nucleation (birth), coalescence (growth), outgassing and fragmentation (death), are stages of volatile's life within the magma. Our understanding of these processes mainly comes from modelling and textural studies. In this work, I have attempted to retrace part <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> bubbles' life by measuring - at high rate - SO 2 outgassing rates from two openvent volcanoes: Stromboli and Etna. On Stromboli (Chapter 5. 3), the UV camera-derived data allowed the first simultaneous estimate of the SO 2 flux contribution from the three main forms of degassing at Stromboli (passive degassing, 84 - 92...|$|R
