The effectiveness of the monolayers are examined for use in an electrowetting-on-dielectric application using anodized aluminum as the substrate.

The procedure is intended to extend the range of applicability and the accuracy of contact stress analyses.

40|$|COPI-coated vesicles mediate {{retrograde}} membrane {{traffic from}} the cis-Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all eukaryotic cells. However, {{it is still}} unknown whether COPI vesicles fuse everywhere or at specific sites with the ER membrane. Taking advantage of the circumstance that the vesicles still carry their coat when they arrive at the ER, we have visualized active ER arrival sites (ERAS) by <b>monitoring</b> <b>contact</b> between COPI coat components and the ER-resident Dsl tethering complex using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). ERAS form punctate structures near Golgi compartments, clearly distinct from ER exit sites. Furthermore, ERAS are highly polarized in an actin and myosin V-dependent manner and are localized near hotspots of plasma membrane expansion. Genetic experiments suggest that the COPI•Dsl BiFC complexes recapitulate the physiological interaction between COPI and the Dsl complex and that COPI vesicles are mistargeted in dsl 1 mutants. We conclude that the Dsl complex functions in confining COPI vesicle fusion sites...|$|E

40|$|Cytochrome c-b_(562) {{belongs to}} an {{interesting}} family of four-helix bundle cytochromes that have nearly identical structures yet widely divergent folding pathways, creating {{a unique opportunity}} to study the relationship between primary sequences and folding in proteins with similar topologies. We characterize the dynamics of cytochrome c-b_(562) through a combination of electron transfer and fluorescence energy transfer (FRET). The dynamics of intrachain diffusion in unfolded cytochromes are probed by <b>monitoring</b> <b>contact</b> quenching of a photoexcited, covalently-bound [Ru(bpy) 2 (IA-phen) ]^(2 +) dye by the heme Fe^(III). Quenching of the *Ru^(II) luminescence decay provides information about the electron transfer rates, which correspond to the rates of transient contact formation. We resolve fast folding by coupling time-resolved FRET with an ultrafast continuous flow mixer. FRET occurs between a small, covalently-bound dansyl fluorophore and the heme. Fitting the dansyl fluorescence decay following picosecond laser excitation provides us with time-dependent dansyl-heme distance distributions during the two-state folding process...|$|E

40|$|Integrated Circuit (IC) sockets provide {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of electrical interconnects in enterprise servers, where quality and reliability are critical for customer applications. The evaluation of IC sockets, according to current industry practices, relies on the execution of stress loads and stress levels that are defined by standards, having no consideration to the physics of failure (PoF), target operating environment, or contact resistance behavior over time. In a similar manner, monitoring of contact resistance during system operation has no considerations to the PoF or environmental conditions. In this dissertation a physics of failure approach was developed to model the reliability of elastomer sockets {{that are used in}} an enterprise server application. The temperature and relative humidity environment, at the IC socket contact interface, were characterized as a function of external environmental conditions and microprocessor activity. The study applied state-of-the-art health monitoring techniques to assess thermal gradients on the IC socket assembly and to establish an operating profile {{that could be used for}} the development of a PoF model. A methodology was developed for modeling and <b>monitoring</b> <b>contact</b> resistance of electrical interconnects. The technique combined a PoF model with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). In the methodology the resistance behavior is characterized as a function of temperature. The effective a-spot radius was extracted from the characterization data and modeled with a power-law. A PoF model was developed to estimate the resistance of an elastomer contact, based on the effective a-spot radius and the ambient temperature. The methodology was experimentally demonstrated with a temperature cycle test of the elastomer socket. During the evaluation the difference between estimated and observed resistance values were tested with the SPRT. The technique was shown to be very accurate for modeling contact resistance and to be highly sensitive for the detection of resistance degradation. A qualitative reliability model was developed for the mean contact resistance of an elastomer socket, using fundamental material properties and user defined failure criteria. To derive the model, the resistance behavior of contacts under nominal mechanical load was studied as a function of time and temperature. The elastomer contact was shown to have a very complex resistance behavior, which was modeled by multiple statistical distributions. It was shown that elastomer sockets, in spite of experiencing stress relaxation at the macroscale (elastomer), can exhibit decreases in contact resistance, a result of stress redistribution at the microscale (Ag particles), which increases Ag-Ag particle stress and the effective contact area...|$|E
