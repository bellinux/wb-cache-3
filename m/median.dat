40|$|AbstractIn {{determining}} phylogenetic trees using gene order information, <b>medians</b> {{provide a}} powerful alternative to pairwise distances. On the other hand, both breakpoint and reversal <b>medians</b> are NP-hard to compute {{and the use}} of <b>medians</b> has been limited to relatively closely related genomes. In this paper, we show that in spite of the greater non-uniqueness of reversal <b>medians,</b> compared to breakpoint <b>medians,</b> <b>medians</b> of moderately distant genomes are often widely spread. This means that regardless of which approximation algorithms one may devise for computing reversal <b>medians,</b> the genomes need to be closely related for phylogenetic tree computations to be successful. To show this, we use results on transposition <b>medians,</b> which behave similarly, and also support our claims with simulations and a real data example with widely spread <b>medians...</b>|$|R

We also show that, in compact Riemannian manifolds, the Fréchet <b>medians</b> of generic data points are always unique. Stochastic and deterministic algorithms are proposed for computing Riemannian p-means. The rate of convergence and error estimates of these algorithms are also obtained.
