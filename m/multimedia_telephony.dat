40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a way of}} capturing and processing data in a multimedia real-time environment of parallel processes, where the data must be processed quickly before it becomes obsolete. It presents a mechanism that achieves this performance requirement by avoiding the overhead of locking or buffering while permitting concurrent access to shared data. Its novelty {{is based on the}} fact that in a multimedia environment, data loss isn't catastrophic, but it must be recognized when data loss occurs. Thus, this approach effectively relaxes concurrency control by permitting the processing component to recognize whether captured data is obsolete prior to processing. If the data is obsolete, it is discarded. This is useful and acceptable in a multimedia environment where data to be processed has to be complete and not corrupted.

30|$|The {{importance}} of real-time systems has enormously {{increased in the}} last decade. Application areas that typically need real-time models include railroad systems, intelligent vehicle highway systems, avionics, <b>multimedia</b> and <b>telephony.</b> To assure that such systems are correct, additionally {{to prove that they}} provide the required functionality, time constraints must be satisfied. There are already formal specification methods for real-time systems, but most of them are difficult to use by software developers, that are usually not very familiar with mathematical notation but rather specify systems using the objectoriented paradigm. In this paper we propose a formal approach to specify and analyze real-time systems that has an object-oriented flavor. This approach is based on Object-Based Graph Grammars (OBGGs), a formal description technique suitable for the specification of asynchronous distributed systems, and intuitive even for nontheoreticians. We extend OBGGs to enable explicit modeling of time constraints, and define the semantics of the specifications via transition systems. Finally, we translate timed OBGGs to Timed Automata, a formal notation that is wide spread in the area of real-time systems modeling and allows the automatic verification of properties.|$|R

For the present, it is useful to consider the problem of generating the critical information useful for speechreading, based on existing narrowband communications systems used for speech. This paper focuses on the problem of synthesizing visual articulatory movements given the acoustic speech signal. In this application, the acoustic speech signal is analyzed and the corresponding articulatory movements are synthesized for speechreading. This paper describes a hidden Markov model (HMM) -based visual speech synthesizer designed to improve speech understanding. The key elements in the application of HMMs to this problem are the decomposition of the overall modeling task into key stages and the judicious determination of the observation vector's components for each stage. The main contribution of this paper is a novel correlation HMM model that is able to integrate independently trained acoustic and visual HMMs for speech-to-visual synthesis. This model allows increased flexibility in choosing model topologies for the acoustic and visual HMMs. Moreover the propose model reduces the amount of training data compared to early integration modeling techniques. Results from objective experiments analysis show that the propose approach can reduce time alignment errors by 37. 4 % compared to conventional temporal scaling method.

Traditional telephony {{services such as}} voice and video real-time communication will be provided {{through the use of}} IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Telephony</b> (MTSI) which imposes high demands on the transport channel. In a packet switched network any intermediary node can act like a congestion bottle neck leading to delay or packet loss. In this scenario a fast end to end adaptation scheme at the media layer can play a vital role to secure service performance by ensuring high quality throughout the session, even in extreme conditions, and keeps the service alive avoiding session termination. This thesis report describes a study of perceived video quality improvement using end to end congestion control depending on both “pre-warning” for congestion and packet loss observed at receiver in IMS video telephony over 3 GPP LTE system according to 3 GPP TS 26. 114 V 7. 0. 0. In the process of achieving the goal a new adaptation state machine was developed with different strategies to address the early congestion notification and packet losses. Simulations has been carried out with different adaptation schemes to compare results and benefits of newly proposed scheme. This thesis shows the effectiveness of early congestion notification for real-time video transmission and reveals some important aspects of adaptation procedure which need to be considered while designing adaptation for video traffic to avoid the congestion in a LTE network.

Indeed, Toulouse is a leading place in France and Europe for embedded and real-time systems design for many domains like aeronautics, and transportation in general. EWiLi workshop featured two distinguished keynote speakers, delivering state-of-the-art presentations on topics related to real-time and embedded operating systems: Dr. Joel Sherrill Director of Research and Development OAR Corporation, USA, with a talk on "Scheduling and Thread Management with RTEMS". Dr. Robert Davis Senior Research Fellow in the Real-Time Systems Research Group, University of York, and a Director of Rapita Systems Ltd., UK, with a talk on: "Uniprocessor Real-Time Scheduling" In addition to the keynotes, three sessions were programmed with three regular paper presentations each: "RTOS scheduling", "RTOS design and implementation" and "Performance and energy issues for embedded operating systems". Accepted regular papers were submitted from 8 different countries. The EWiLi Program Committee worked hard to provide high quality reviews for each paper (at least 3 reviews per paper). The 3 rd edition of EWiLi was made possible thanks to the support of different institutions including: AdaCore, Captronic, Lab-STICC laboratory, University of Western Brittany (UBO, Brest).
