500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had {{to have some sort}} of revenge. It could have <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E

Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of [...] "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed [...] "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan [...] "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: [...] "Now the heart is filled with gold {{as if it was a}} purse"? ...|$|E
500|$|Including his {{stops at}} both two- and {{four-year}} schools, Saban's overall collegiate coaching record was 94–99–4. Including playoffs, his professional football record stands at 97–101–7. Saban had periods of {{success as a}} player and as a coach at the college and professional levels, but his constant moves from job to job eventually came to define him. [...] "I have been known as a peripatetic coach", he said in 1994. [...] "The first time I was called that, I thought it was a dirty word. I looked it up in the dictionary and found it <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> moved around a lot." [...] Saban was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and, in a surprise move, was added to the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame in 2015.

500|$|On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., Sotomayor {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, {{the day before the}} new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. [...] The decision raised her profile, won her the plaudits of baseball fans, and had a lasting effect on the game. In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, [...] "I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> was not a baseball fan.

500|$|During the {{production}} of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series: [...] "After watching Joe [...] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I {{would never want to}} produce a show of my own." [...] However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: [...] "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E

500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1999–2000 season {{would be}} Barkley's final {{year in the}} NBA. Initially, Barkley {{averaged}} 14.5 points on [...]477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game. Along with Shaquille O'Neal, Barkley was ejected from a November 10, 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal. Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely {{at the age of}} 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began. Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation. He stated, [...] "I can't explain what tonight <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> did it for me. I've won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own." [...] After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career.|$|E
2500|$|When I played Booker's album, {{the first}} thing that I noticed was what bizarre song titles it had—stuff like [...] "Coquette" [...] and [...] "Piano Salad." [...] I didn't know what [...] "piano salad" [...] <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> {{had no idea what to}} make of the music either. I know how to listen to {{something}} like the Neville Brothers or Irma Thomas, but Booker's music I didn't even know how to listen to. It was like a different language.|$|E

2500|$|When {{talking about}} {{the close of the}} title, Cornell stated [...] "Our {{audience}} really left at issue four... People protest about events, but try and write a comic now without them.

I’d be part of an event every issue if I could, if it <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> could keep the title going. ... after [...] Birmingham I realised that the only way the book would survive would be huge event stories of our own."

He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In the place where I was a child, there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know what that <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> think I thought it meant that I would be in a situation different than the one that I was in." ...|$|E
2500|$|After graduating school Nina couldn't {{decide which}} college to go to, so Arkady Shatsky {{sent her to}} a {{settlement}} near an agricultural factory to work there for {{a year as a}} club administrator.

A year later Nina moved to Leningrad and enrolled in the Management faculty at the [...] Later she attended the Music Hall Studio School, graduating from both. In Leningrad she felt uncomfortable and lonely. [...] "While my girl friends were busy courting men, I spent all my evenings in the Conservatory or the Philharmonics," [...] she said in an interview. Yet Shatskaya recalled fondly her years at the Leningrad Music Hall. [...] "The teachers there were fantastic, and the performers were all individuals, each cultivating their own manner," [...] she reminisced. She moved to the Moscow Music Hall and studied vocals at [...] Gnesyn Academy, in the class of Natalya Andrianova, while also making miscellaneous recordings with orchestras for Soviet TV and radio.|$|E

2500|$|Developing for the PC {{brought a}} number of advantages, {{not the least of}} which was it allowed the team to make the game using 3D {{computer}} graphics. As Bruty explains, [...] "I wanted to work on PC because the game was 3D, which wasn't an option on consoles at that point." [...] Tim Williams explains another advantage of working on PC was [...] "it <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have to tone the game down to deal with the Sega and Nintendo's ratings boards. I loved [...] I could see immediately the game would have a unique look and plenty of design opportunities. We were all big fans of the Alien movies and H. R. Giger, so that probably had some influence." [...] As Shiny intended the game to be gory, even going so far as to study tapes of people dying in gruesome manners to see the effects of violent deaths on the human body, this lack of censorship was ideal. Once the decision was made to develop for the PC, the team quickly decided they wanted to make a game that would push the boundaries of PC gaming beyond anything seen up to that point.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

The group included future RCA Records producer and recording artist Rick Jarrard. Parks later said of this decision, [...] "Going to California <b>meant</b> <b>I</b> escaped John Cage. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can't remember, the highbrow angst." [...] The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco. One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future Byrds member David Crosby, who at the time remarked to friend David Lindley, [...] "If {{they can get away with}} it, so can we." [...] While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show Art Linkletter's House Party but was not accepted. Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England to be part of the Brandywine Singers, earning up to $3,000 a week.|$|E
