500|$|Chéreau {{was in a}} {{long-term}} relationship with his lover and favorite actor Pascal Greggory. He {{was not interested in}} gay topics, saying: [...] "I never wanted to specialise in gay stories, and gay newspapers have criticised <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> Everywhere love stories are exactly the same. The game of desire, and how you live with desire, are the same." ...|$|E
500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, while {{awaiting}} {{the consequences of}} the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: [...] "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens." [...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that happened to me in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't {{want to come out}} with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you actually felt it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A rematch {{between the}} two fighters was {{described}} (in 2009) as being [...] "much anticipated", but has failed to eventuate. In March 2009 Mundine stated [...] "I've been there and done that (with Green), so {{the only thing that}} is going to inspire <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> fight is the money" [...] and [...] "... all I want is champions. I don't want to be messing around with no contenders." [...] The rivalry continued into 2012 with Green stating: [...] "He won the fight on the night but since then he's avoided the immediate rematch clause" [...] and [...] "Most people in Australia know that that victory is pretty shallow, as far as him fighting a dehydrated, starving ghost" [...] (referring to the considerable weight drop Green undertook for the fight with Mundine).|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{has spoken}} {{extensively}} {{of her time}} in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being [...] "pelted with ketchup packets". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had [...] "always gotten along better with boys" [...] and that [...] "rubbed some people the wrong way". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that [...] "everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn’t like <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> I’ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has [...] "never been {{a big believer in}} formal education" [...] and that [...] "the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it".|$|E

2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E
