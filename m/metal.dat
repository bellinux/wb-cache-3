5|$|According to Johnny Loftus of AllMusic, Damageplan {{incorporated}} {{elements of}} traditional heavy <b>metal,</b> post-grunge, metalcore, and death <b>metal.</b> Their sound has mainly {{been described as}} nu <b>metal</b> and thrash <b>metal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{bands like}} Sarcofago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other black <b>metal</b> acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking <b>metal</b> and folk <b>metal</b> movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black <b>metal</b> scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death <b>metal</b> generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian <b>metal</b> underground shifted to support a black <b>metal</b> scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial <b>metal</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Christian <b>metal</b> soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian <b>metal</b> label was Pure <b>Metal</b> Records, a sublabel of Refuge Records. Soon there appeared other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's <b>Metal</b> as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested in Christian <b>metal,</b> and they advertised the newly signed <b>metal</b> bands on their roster on Heaven's <b>Metal</b> since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's <b>Metal</b> achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's <b>Metal</b> achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian <b>metal</b> releases were typically distributed in Christian bookstores, and those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian <b>metal</b> cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, the B-subgroup <b>metals</b> are the <b>metals</b> in Groups IB to VIB of the {{periodic}} table, corresponding to Groups 11 to 16 using current IUPAC nonmenclature. Practically, the group 11 <b>metals</b> (copper, silver and gold) are ordinarily regarded as transition <b>metals</b> (or sometimes as coinage <b>metals,</b> or noble <b>metals)</b> whereas the group 12 <b>metals</b> (zinc, cadmium, and mercury) {{may or may}} not be treated as B-subgroup <b>metals</b> depending on if the transition <b>metals</b> are taken to end at group 11 or group 12. The 'B' nomenclature (as in Groups IB, IIB, and so on) was superseded in 1988 but is still occasionally encountered in more recent literature.|$|R
2500|$|Van Wert grouped the {{periodic}} table <b>metals</b> into a. the light metals; b. the heavy brittle <b>metals</b> of high melting point, c. the heavy ductile <b>metals</b> of high melting point; d. the heavy <b>metals</b> {{of low melting point}} (Zn, Cd, Hg; Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn; As, Sb, Bi; and Po), and e. the strong, electropositive <b>metals.</b> Britton, Abbatiello and Robins speak of 'the soft, low melting point, heavy <b>metals</b> in columns lIB, IlIA, IVA, and VA of {{the periodic}} table, namely Zn, Cd, Hg; Al, Ga, In, Tl; , Ge, Sn, Pb; and Bi. The Sargent-Welch Chart of the Elements groups the <b>metals</b> into: light <b>metals,</b> the lanthanide series; the actinide series; heavy <b>metals</b> (brittle); heavy <b>metals</b> (ductile); and heavy <b>metals</b> (low melting point): Zn, Cd, Hg, Al, Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi; and Po.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common <b>metals</b> such as iron, copper, and tin, {{and precious}} <b>metals</b> such as silver, gold, and platinum—are heavy <b>metals.</b> From 1809 onwards, light <b>metals,</b> such as magnesium, aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy <b>metals</b> including gallium, thallium, and hafnium.|$|R
5|$|Christian <b>metal,</b> {{also known}} as white <b>metal,</b> Jesus <b>metal</b> or heavenly <b>metal,</b> {{is a form of}} heavy <b>metal</b> music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the {{dedication}} of the band members to Christianity. Christian <b>metal</b> is typically performed by professed Christians principally for Christians who listen to heavy <b>metal</b> music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, glam <b>metal</b> {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} an array of more aggressive styles: thrash <b>metal</b> broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of <b>metal</b> such as death <b>metal</b> and black <b>metal</b> remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove <b>metal</b> (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu <b>metal</b> (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E
5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom <b>metal</b> {{movement}} rejected other <b>metal</b> styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom <b>metal</b> traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom <b>metal</b> {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of <b>metal.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Metals</b> have non-zero {{density of}} states at the Fermi level. <b>Metals</b> with free-electron-like band {{structures}} (e.g. alkali <b>metals,</b> alkaline earth <b>metals,</b> Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low {{density of states}} at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition <b>metals,</b> wherein the flat d-bands lie close to the Fermi level, generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like <b>metals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Metals</b> {{comprise}} {{the large majority}} of the elements, and can be subdivided into several different categories. From left to right in the periodic table, these categories include the highly reactive alkali metals; the less reactive alkaline earth <b>metals,</b> lanthanides and radioactive actinides; the archetypal transition <b>metals,</b> and the physically and chemically weak post-transition <b>metals.</b> Specialized subcategories such as the refractory <b>metals</b> and the noble <b>metals</b> also exist.|$|R

5|$|Glam <b>metal</b> (also {{known as}} hair <b>metal</b> and often used synonymously with pop <b>metal)</b> is a subgenre of heavy <b>metal</b> which {{features}} pop-influenced hooks and guitar riffs, and borrows from {{the fashion of}} 1970s glam rock.|$|E
5|$|Gojira's {{sound is}} not easily classifiable as they blend several styles. Gojira are a {{technical}} death <b>metal</b> band that blends death <b>metal,</b> groove <b>metal,</b> and progressive <b>metal.</b> Gojira {{have been influenced by}} heavy <b>metal</b> artists such as Slayer, Sepultura, Death, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Tool, Metallica, Pantera, and Neurosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy <b>metal</b> music losing popularity and going underground for a decade. Many Christian <b>metal</b> musicians began to play extreme <b>metal,</b> and soon death <b>metal</b> replaced thrash <b>metal</b> in popularity. Audiences in many underground <b>metal</b> scenes began favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam <b>metal</b> acts of the time, Stryper lost popularity and split up in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Toxic <b>metals</b> {{sometimes}} {{imitate the}} action of an essential element in the body, interfering with the metabolic process resulting in illness. Many <b>metals,</b> particularly heavy <b>metals</b> are toxic, but some heavy <b>metals</b> are essential, and some, such as bismuth, have a low toxicity. Most often the definition of toxic <b>metals</b> includes at least cadmium, manganese, lead, mercury and the radioactive <b>metals.</b> Metalloids (arsenic, polonium) may {{be included in the}} definition. Radioactive <b>metals</b> have both radiological toxicity and chemical toxicity. <b>Metals</b> in an oxidation state abnormal to the body may also become toxic: chromium(III) is an essential trace element, but chromium(VI) is a carcinogen.|$|R
50|$|Noble <b>metals</b> are <b>metals</b> {{that are}} {{resistant}} to corrosion or oxidation, unlike most base <b>metals.</b> They tend to be precious <b>metals,</b> often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold, platinum, silver, rhodium, iridium and palladium.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century some groups reached {{mainstream}} popularity. There are Christian <b>metal</b> bands that perform virtually every subgenre of <b>metal.</b> The Christian <b>metal</b> movement has spread worldwide since it emerged in the early 1980s, and there are now hundreds of active Christian <b>metal</b> bands. Inspired by the <b>metal</b> revival, many 1980s bands have made comebacks including Saint, Bloodgood and Stryper. In October 2004, Doug Van Pelt brought Heaven's <b>Metal</b> back as its own fanzine. The Internet has had a significant role on the revival of Christian <b>metal</b> as well. Many websites and online communities are dedicated to discussions about Christian metal's music, events, and bands.|$|E
5|$|Industrial <b>metal</b> {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and <b>metal</b> began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the black <b>metal</b> scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Industrial <b>metal</b> did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The industrial <b>metal</b> movement began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Industrial <b>metal</b> is {{the fusion}} of heavy <b>metal</b> music and {{industrial}} music, typically employing repeating <b>metal</b> guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Founding industrial <b>metal</b> acts include Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, and Rammstein.|$|E

5|$|Korn are {{identified}} as the pioneers of nu <b>metal</b> music, a form of alternative <b>metal</b> music {{which began in the}} mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative <b>metal</b> and nu <b>metal</b> band, the band has also been labeled as heavy <b>metal,</b> grunge, hard rock, rap <b>metal,</b> funk <b>metal,</b> groove <b>metal</b> and industrial <b>metal.</b> Their debut album mixed <b>metal,</b> funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy <b>metal</b> themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu <b>metal</b> band in the world.|$|E
5|$|Many subgenres {{of heavy}} <b>metal</b> {{developed}} {{outside of the}} commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash. Several {{attempts have been made}} to map the complex world of underground <b>metal,</b> most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume <b>metal</b> encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash <b>metal,</b> death <b>metal,</b> black <b>metal,</b> power <b>metal,</b> and the related subgenres of doom and gothic <b>metal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah first {{attracted}} {{international attention}} with the 1995 release Destroy Erase Improve for its fusion of fast-tempo death <b>metal,</b> thrash <b>metal,</b> progressive <b>metal</b> and jazz fusion elements. Since its 2002 album Nothing, Meshuggah has switched from seven-string to downtuned eight-string guitars. Meshuggah {{has become known}} for their innovative musical style, complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. Meshuggah was labelled {{as one of the}} ten most important hard rock and heavy <b>metal</b> bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in <b>metal</b> by Alternative Press. Meshuggah has found little mainstream success, but is a significant act in extreme underground music and an influence for modern <b>metal</b> bands. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the djent subgenre within progressive <b>metal.</b>|$|E

This edition of <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid 3 features the first disc from the Subsistence version and a new second disc containing only the MSX2 <b>Metal</b> Gear games, lacking <b>Metal</b> Gear Online (due to the discontinuation of its servers), as well as all the other content that was present in Subsistences original second disc (Snake vs. Monkey, Duel Mode and Secret Theater). A similar box set was released for the North American market on March 2008, titled <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid: The Essential Collection, which includes the first disc of <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid 3: Subsistence along with the original <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid and <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid 2: Substance, but lacks the second disc with the MSX2 games from the Japanese 20th Anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Garth Richardson, Spit is a nu <b>metal</b> {{album with}} {{elements}} of heavy <b>metal,</b> speed <b>metal,</b> techno, alternative rock, rap, groove <b>metal,</b> alternative <b>metal</b> and death <b>metal.</b> Spit, whose lyrical themes include sexism, hatred, ignorance, betrayal, bullying and life experiences, received mixed or positive reviews. Some critics praised the album's aggression but some critics criticized the album's song titles, lyrics and attitude. After releasing Spit, Kittie went on tours with bands such as Chevelle, Slipknot, Suicidal Tendencies, and Shuvel. Kittie also performed at Ozzfest and the 2001 SnoCore festival. Kittie planned to tour with Pantera, but the tour fell through when Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo fell and broke two ribs.|$|E
50|$|Owing {{to their}} strong {{affinity}} for oxygen, lithophile <b>metals,</b> although they form the great {{bulk of the}} metallic elements in Earth's crust, were never available as free <b>metals</b> before the development of electrolysis. With this development, many lithophile <b>metals</b> are of considerable value as structural <b>metals</b> (magnesium, aluminium, titanium, vanadium) or as reducing agents (sodium, magnesium, calcium). The process of smelting these <b>metals</b> is extremely energy-intensive. With {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} suspected of contributing to climate change, the use of these elements as industrial <b>metals</b> is called into question, despite the depletion of rarer and less reactive chalcophile <b>metals</b> leaving few substitutes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metals</b> {{can also}} be used to create MEMS elements. While <b>metals</b> do not have some of the {{advantages}} displayed by silicon in terms of mechanical properties, when used within their limitations, <b>metals</b> can exhibit very high degrees of reliability. <b>Metals</b> can be deposited by electroplating, evaporation, and sputtering processes. Commonly used <b>metals</b> include gold, nickel, aluminium, copper, chromium, titanium, tungsten, platinum, and silver.|$|R
500|$|The group 11 <b>metals</b> (or coinage <b>metals),</b> copper, silver, and gold, are {{typically}} categorised as transition <b>metals</b> given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells.

Transition <b>metals</b> {{to the left of}} group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility." [...] Chemically, the group 11 <b>metals</b> behave like main-group <b>metals</b> in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is one reason for their previously being labelled as [...] "group IB", paralleling the alkali metals' [...] "group IA".
