Charlie was a great spinner and <b>many</b> <b>say</b> if he had played in the ACA {{competition}} he would have played for Auckland and maybe New Zealand but Charlie was a loyal C man and later played for the Greenlane Cricket Club up until the mid Nineties which made him a very mature cricketer indeed.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in recent}} years, {{there has been}} {{controversy}} over even consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers, especially within the last decade. Like many, Gallop asserts that the relationships between a teacher and a student {{is very much like}} that of a parent and a child. (Gallop, 1997) However, it is this parallel that <b>many</b> <b>say</b> is the reason teacher-pupil sexual contact and relations are immoral because they are too closely akin to incest, and similar long-term damages can result.|$|E
25|$|Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd {{instantly}} transfers its hatred {{to the new}} enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions {{from one}} power unit to another (for example, Communism, Pacifism, Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and <b>many</b> <b>say</b> {{that they must be}} the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.|$|E

There, he was entertained by Mansfield Markham and his wife Beryl Markham. Beryl and Henry soon started an affair (though sources differ over when the affair started; <b>many</b> <b>say</b> it was not until her visit to England). In November, the brothers were recalled to England due to their father’s worsening health, and soon after Beryl returned too. At the Grosvenor Hotel, close to Buckingham Palace, the affair continued with Prince Henry openly hosting parties with her in her suite and drinking too much.|$|E

Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which <b>many</b> <b>say</b> revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E

Previously, Marshall had been {{a leader of the}} Federalist Party in Virginia and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1799 to 1800.

25|$|Unitas {{resumed his}} torrid passing in 1965, as he threw for 2,530 yards, 23 touchdowns and {{finished}} with a league-high and career best 97.1 passer rating. But he was lost for {{the balance of the}} season due to a knee injury in a week 12 loss to the Bears. More postseason heartbreak would follow in 1965. The Colts and Packers finished in a tie for first place in the Western Conference and a one-game playoff was played in Green Bay to decide who would be the conference representative in the 1965 NFL Championship Game. The Colts lost in overtime 13–10 {{due in large part to}} a game-tying field goal by Don Chandler that <b>many</b> <b>say</b> was incorrectly ruled good. Backup quarterback Gary Cuozzo also suffered a season-ending injury the following week and it would be running back Tom Matte who filled in as the emergency QB for the regular-season finale and the playoff loss to the Packers.|$|E
25|$|The Dhakeshwari {{temple was}} built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and <b>many</b> <b>say</b> the city was named after this temple. The current {{architectural}} style of the temple cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many researchers say that the temple {{is also one of the}} Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. Although there is not enough historical context to establish this as a fact, researchers were directed to this site while trying to locate the particular Shakti Peetha. Since ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 800-year-old statue was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. There remains the replica of original idol in Dhaka. The temple was further damaged during the Muslim mob attacks of 1989–90.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and <b>many</b> <b>say</b> that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E
