Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease,</b> like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E

Because the integration of these stresses is critical to the pathogenesis of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> agents and cellular molecules that can modulate these stress responses are emerging as potential targets for intervention and treatment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> It has been recognized that heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{plays an important role in}} cellular protection. Because HO- 1 can reduce inflammatory stress, oxidative stress, and ER stress, in part by exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects, HO- 1 has been suggested to play important roles in pathogenesis of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> In the present review, we will explore our current understanding of the protective mechanisms of HO- 1 in <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> and present some emerging therapeutic options for HO- 1 expression in treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> together with the therapeutic potential of curcumin and resveratrol analogues that have their ability to induce HO- 1 expression...|$|R

40|$|Impaired glucose {{homeostasis}} {{is one of}} the risk factors for causing <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancers. In glucose metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) mediates a major regulatory step, an irreversible reaction of oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Tight control of PDC is critical because it {{plays a key role in}} glucose disposal. PDC activity is tightly regulated using phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK 1 to 4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP 1 and 2). PDKs and PDPs exhibit unique tissue expression patterns, kinetic properties, and sensitivities to regulatory molecules. During the last decades, the up-regulation of PDKs has been observed in the tissues of patients and mammals with <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> which suggests that the inhibition of these kinases may have beneficial effects for treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review summarizes the recent advances in the role of specific PDK isoenzymes on the induction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> and describes the effects of PDK inhibition on the prevention of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> using pharmacological inhibitors. Based on these reports, PDK isoenzymes are strong therapeutic targets for preventing and treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as {{obesity and}} type 2 diabetes, are world-wide health problems. The {{prevalence}} of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is associated with}} dynamic changes in dietary macronutrient intake during the past decades. Based on national statistics and from a public health viewpoint, traditional approaches, such as diet and physical activity, have been unsuccessful in decreasing the prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Since the approaches strongly rely on individual’s behavior and motivation, novel science-based strategies should be considered for prevention and therapy for the diseases. Metabolism and immune system are linked. Both overnutrition and infection result in inflammation through nutrient and pathogen sensing systems which recognize compounds with structural similarities. Dietary macronutrients (fats and sugars) can induce inflammation through activation of an innate immune receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). Long-term intake of diets high in fats and meats appear to induce chronic systemic low-grade inflammation, endotoxicity, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Recent investigations {{support the idea of}} the involvement of intestinal bacteria in host metabolism and preventative and therapeutic potentials of probiotic and prebiotic interventions for <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Specific intestinal bacteria seem to serve as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sources through LPS and/or bacterial translocation into the circulation due to a vulnerable microbial barrier and increased intestinal permeability and {{to play a role in}} systemic inflammation and progression of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review focuses on mechanistic links between <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> (mainly obesity and type 2 diabetes), chronic systemic low-grade inflammation, intestinal environment, and nutrition and prospective views of probiotic and prebiotic interventions for the diseases. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{alternative}} {{theories of}} carcinogenesis, however, {{are based on}} scientific evidence and are increasingly being acknowledged. Some researchers believe that cancer {{may be caused by}} [...] aneuploidy (numerical and structural abnormalities in chromosomes) [...] rather than by mutations or epimutations. Cancer has also been considered as a <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease</b> in which the cellular metabolism of oxygen is diverted from the pathway that generates energy (oxidative phosphorylation) to the pathway that generates reactive oxygen species (...) [...] This causes an energy switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's hypothesis) and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress (oxidative stress theory of cancer). All these theories of carcinogenesis may be complementary rather than contradictory.
