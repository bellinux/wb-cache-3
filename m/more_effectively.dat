5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed <b>more</b> <b>effectively.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Portugal's inaction, Fretilin leaders {{believed}} they could ward off Indonesian advances <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> if they declared an independent East Timor. National Political Commissioner Mari Alkatiri conducted a diplomatic tour of Africa, gathering support from governments there and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a Grand Tour {{to study}} the outer planets was {{proposed}} which prompted NASA to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s.

5|$|James Palermo, {{artistic and}} general {{director}} of the Grant Park Music Festival felt that the musicians were able to interact <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> with the new sound system because {{they were able to}} hear each other better.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey <b>more</b> <b>effectively,</b> the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|That {{exposed the}} fact that {{domestic}} firms could not compete with foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems.

5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus <b>more</b> <b>effectively,</b> leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly {{understood}} that his military decisions would be <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> {{carried out by}} conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much <b>more</b> <b>effectively.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> {{of the two}} and scored what {{proved to be the}} winning goal in the latter minutes of the first half – Freddie Ljungberg's rebounded goal effort was {{converted}} by Robert Pirès. Midway through the second half, Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi was substituted, as he strained his calf muscle; he was replaced by Paul Jones. In stoppage time, striker James Beattie had his header cleared off the line by Ashley Cole, in what was the final chance for Southampton.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited {{the effectiveness of their}} radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used <b>more</b> <b>effectively.</b>|$|E

5|$|General life {{themes are}} portrayed on wall panels {{such as the}} way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the {{depiction}} of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical).

5|$|In 2000, {{the brigade}} {{took on the}} {{additional}} responsibility of training Reserve Officer's Training Corps cadets. The 8th Brigade, 95th Division was activated as a provisional unit in charge of ROTC units throughout the southwestern United States.

This put the division at the area's major training center, allowing it to <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> provide training oversight.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} unit {{was formed to}} attack Italian forts <b>more</b> <b>effectively.</b> Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had to be abandoned and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he felt his writing staff {{would have been able to}} work <b>more</b> <b>effectively</b> if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson said he felt the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate <b>more</b> <b>effectively.</b> Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E
