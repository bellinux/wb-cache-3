5|$|Born in Michigan, Sebille {{worked as}} an MC in Chicago, Illinois before joining the U.S. Army Air Corps shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Sebille flew B-26 <b>Marauder</b> bombers over Europe from 1943 to 1945. He flew 68 combat {{missions}} and accrued more than 3,000 hours of flying time. Sebille briefly became a commercial airline pilot after the war before he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant and reentered the service in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No.3AD) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 16March 1942. It {{came under the}} control of No.5 (Maintenance) Group. The depot's first, temporary, {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader W.H. Nicholson. On establishment, No.3AD's main purpose was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters and a dozen Martin B-26 <b>Marauder</b> medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and despatching them to No.5 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, for repair.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps {{two weeks after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. He began flight {{training}} in January 1942, in spite of being two months older than the cutoff age of 26, as the desperate need for pilots combined with Sebille's skills as a pilot allowed him to waive the age restriction. During that time he was described as an outstanding pilot and leader, and his maturity was helpful for the younger flight trainees. After completing flight training, Sebille was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 450th Bombardment Squadron, 322nd Bombardment Group 3rd Bombardment Wing at MacDill Field, Florida. Sebille flew B-26 <b>Marauder</b> aircraft.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 3 June, she {{launched}} nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only {{six of the}} B5Ns {{and all of the}} Zeros were able {{to make it through the}} bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryūjō from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 <b>Marauder</b> bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Deployed to England in January 1943, Sebille flew bombing {{missions}} in the European theatre. The 322nd Bombardment Group, the first unit {{to fly the}} B-26 <b>Marauder,</b> was sent on its first mission on May 14, a low-altitude attack on an electrical power plant in the Netherlands {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany. The mission was Sebille's first sortie, and the group suffered one plane lost and 10 damaged. Three days later a second attack was assigned on the same target, however, Sebille was not on the mission list. Of the planes that flew the mission, one aborted and the rest did not return. Sebille advanced to flight leader and then was promoted to squadron operations officer with a temporary rank of major. By the end of the war, Sebille had flown 68 combat missions with 245 combat hours. In the war he had been awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and twelve Air Medals. His unit returned to the United States in March, 1945.|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 <b>Marauder</b> medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1942 Hansell {{received}} his first combat command, the 3rd Bombardment Wing. Originally {{one of the}} three wings of General Headquarters Air Force, the 3rd was now part of the Eighth Air Force in England, planned as a Martin B-26 <b>Marauder</b> unit with the mission of supporting the Eighth's heavy bomber operations by bombing Luftwaffe fighter airfields. However the wing had no aircraft or units yet assigned, and on January 2, 1943, Hansell was shifted to command the 1st Bomb Wing, the B-17 component of VIII Bomber Command. Hansell flew his first mission with his new command the next day to bomb the submarine pens at Saint-Nazaire, France. He saw first hand the effectiveness of German interceptors, as both wingmen of Hansell's bomber were shot down. Later that month, on a January 13 mission to Lille, France, the pilot of the B-17 in which he flew was killed in action and the plane nearly shot down on.|$|E
5|$|That day, Lützow had led {{a flight}} of six Me262s of JV44 against a force of 256 medium bombers of the 322nd and 344th Bombardment Group (344th BG). Lützow's flight {{included}} Hauptmann Walter Krupinski and Oberleutnant Klaus Neumann. Two of the Me262s had to abort the mission due to engine problems. The remaining four, of which at least Lützow's and Neumann's Me262s were armed with the R4M air-to-air rockets, attacked elements of 344thBG. Following the first attack, at least three B-26 <b>Marauder</b> bombers were seen trailing smoke, when the Me262s came under attack by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft of the 365th Fighter Group. Blue Flight leader Captain Jerry G. Mast and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Byron Smith, went into full power dives to drive the attacking Me262s away. Following the dive, Smith got separated from Mast and pursued an Me262. Mast and Second Lieutenant William H. Myers then jointly went after another Me262 which went into an even steeper dive. The Me262 was seen crashing {{into the ground and}} exploding. In Forsyth's account, the Me262 chased by Mast and Myers was Lützow's and had been flying furthest to the south.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{although}} not a mutant, she joined the <b>Marauders,</b> a group of mutants working as assassins for the enigmatic geneticist known as Mister Sinister. Sinister wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the Morlocks, who lived under New York City, as he had deemed them genetically useless. The <b>Marauders</b> did succeed in annihilating {{a large number of}} the underground mutants. While the <b>Marauders</b> were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men, X-Factor, Thor, and Power Pack. With the <b>Marauders,</b> she also attempted to kill Madelyne Pryor.|$|R
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 <b>Marauder</b> bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E

The Squadron flew its first operational mission on 6 November 1942, being used for long range reconnaissance, mine-laying and anti-shipping strikes. Unlike the USAAF, 14 Squadron made productive use of the equipment for carrying torpedoes, sinking several merchant ships with this weapon. The <b>Marauder</b> also proved useful in disrupting enemy air transport, shooting down considerable numbers of German and Italian transport aircraft flying between Italy and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Sint-Truiden Air Base was a {{frequent}} target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 <b>Marauder</b> medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Saint Trond after the <b>Marauder</b> raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Saint Trond on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.|$|E
