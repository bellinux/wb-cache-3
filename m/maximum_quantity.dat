Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the <b>maximum</b> <b>quantity</b> set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E

25|$|In 1798 Murdoch {{returned}} to Birmingham {{to work in}} the Soho foundry and continued his experiments with gas, as part of which he lit the interior of the Soho main building, although it is likely that it was lit only in part and not (at this time) permanently. In 1802 as part of the public celebrations of the Peace of Amiens he made a public exhibition of his lighting by illuminating the exterior of the Soho Foundry. The first industrial factory to be illuminated by gas was the Philips and Lee cotton mill in Manchester which was fully lit by Murdoch in 1805, four years after the idea was first broached. Initially this mill contained 50 gas lights, although this soon grew to 904. The length of time taken to complete this project was partly due to experimentations and improvements in the process developed by Murdoch to make the lighting of a large factory by gas practicable and cost effective – such as purifying the gas with lime to remove the smell and determining the best temperature to heat coal to obtain the <b>maximum</b> <b>quantity</b> of gas – although Murdoch continued to be involved in other engine work for Boulton and Watt, which took up much of his time.|$|E
6000|$|The {{foregoing}} considerations {{leave no}} doubt about the fundamental condition of the existence of any polity, or organised society of men, either in a purely pastoral or purely agricultural state, or in any mixture of both states. It must possess a store of vital capital to start with, and the means of repairing the consumption of that capital which takes place {{as a consequence of the}} work of the members of the society. And, if the polity occupies a completely isolated area of the earth's surface, the numerical strength of that polity can never exceed the quotient of the <b>maximum</b> <b>quantity</b> of food-stuffs producible by the green plants on that area, in each year, divided by the quantity necessary for the maintenance of each person during the year. But, there is a third mode of existence possible to a polity; it may, conceivably, be neither purely pastoral nor purely agricultural, but purely manufacturing. Let us suppose three islands, like Gran Canaria, Teneriffe and Lanzerote, in the Canaries, to be quite cut off from the rest of the world. Let Gran Canaria be [164] inhabited by grain-raisers, Teneriffe by cattle-breeders; while the population of Lanzerote (which we may suppose to be utterly barren) consists of carpenters, woollen manufacturers, and shoemakers. Then the facts of daily experience teach us that the people of Lanzerote could never have existed unless they came to the island provided with a stock of food-stuffs; and that they could not continue to exist, unless that stock, as it was consumed, was made up by contributions from the vital capital of either Gran Canaria, or Teneriffe, or both. Moreover, the carpenters of Lanzerote could do nothing, unless they were provided with wood from the other islands; nor could the wool spinners and weavers or the shoemakers work without wool and skins from the same sources. The wood and the wool and the skins are, in fact, the capital without which their work as manufacturers in their respective trades is impossible--so that the vital and other capital supplied by Gran Canaria and Teneriffe is most indubitably the necessary antecedent of the industrial labour of Lanzerote. It is perfectly true that by the time the wood, the wool, and the skins reached Lanzerote a good deal of labour in cutting, shearing, skinning, transport, and so on, would have been spent upon them. But this does not alter the fact that the only [...] "production" [...] which is essential to the existence of the population of Teneriffe and Gran Canaria is that effected by the [165] green plants in both islands; and that all the labour spent upon the raw produce useful in manufacture, directly or indirectly yielded by them--by the inhabitants of these islands and by those of Lanzerote into the bargain--will not provide one solitary Lanzerotian with a dinner, unless the Teneriffians and Canariotes happen to want his goods and to be willing to give some of their vital capital in exchange for them.|$|E

40|$|The National Residue Control Plan (NRCP) is a {{programme}} {{for examining}} foods of animal origin, such as meat, milk and honey, for residues and contaminants. Animal-based products {{from third countries}} are examined {{on the basis of}} the Import Control Plan (ICP). <b>Maximum</b> <b>quantities</b> and/or <b>maximum</b> levels which may not be exceeded have been established in many cases for residues of pharmacologically effective substances and environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals and dioxins, in foods of animal origin. The goal of food monitoring within the scope of the NRCP and ICP is to check for compliance with these <b>maximum</b> <b>quantities</b> and levels, to disclose the illegal use of prohibited or unauthorised substances and to identify the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants. Sampling is carried out risk-oriented. […] The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the health risk of the residue findings. […] In the view of the BfR, the total number of exceedances continues to lie on a low level. The levels of heavy metals and other contaminants determined in the NRCP in offal, fatty tissue and muscle give no indication of an additional health risk to consumers in the opinion of the BfR. Even in cases in which the maximum levels for lead, cadmium or mercury were exceeded, no health impairment is to be expected given the typical eating habits of the German population. It must be emphasised, however, that the overall intake of lead and cadmium from all foods, both animal and plant-based, is high.
