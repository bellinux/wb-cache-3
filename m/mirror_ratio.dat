It was also expected that smaller magnetic field would reflect less particles. However, the gyroradius in those circumstances is also larger, so that the radial component of the magnetic field seen by the particle is also larger.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{central focus}} of this thesis is the design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistor (TFT) current mirrors. The thin-film deposition and circuit fabrication methods used to realize zinc tin oxide (ZTO) TFT current mirrors are {{addressed in order to}} elucidate the processing challenges for this material system. Accurate current mirror behavior is demonstrated for current mirrors with small <b>mirroring</b> <b>ratios.</b> Deviations from the ideal <b>mirroring</b> <b>ratio</b> are attributed to three primary sources: TFT geometric mismatch, threshold voltage mismatch, and finite output resistance. The most significant source of mirroring error for the current mirrors fabricated is geometric mismatch associated with processing. Variations in TFT size leading to mirroring error arise from the use of mylar masks, inconsistent channel etching, and lift-off patterning of source-drain contacts. Geometric mismatch must be reduced before the effects of threshold voltage mismatch and finite output resistance on mirroring error can be unambiguously assessed. TFT size variation, and thus mirroring error, can be reduced by using chrome masks, developing an improved channel etch, avoiding lift-off processing and utilizing more sophisticated circuit layout. The work of this thesis continues to support the use of AOS for a variety of applications. Current mirrors are a vital analog circuit building block, used in a multitude of circuits, without which the scope of AOS-based electronics will be limited. The successful realization of such a circuit in ZTO, despite the processing challenges, bolsters the case that AOS can be used in the next stage of large-area electronics...|$|R
40|$|Production of high {{charge state}} ions with the Advanced Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source (AECR) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been {{significantly}} improved by application of various new techniques. Heating the plasma simultaneously with microwaves of two frequencies (10 and 14 GHz) {{has increased the}} production of very high charge state heavy ions. The two-frequency technique provides extra electron cyclotron resonance heating zone {{as compared to the}} single-frequency heating and improves the heating of the plasma electrons. Aluminum oxide on the plasma chamber surface improves the production of cold electrons at the chamber surfaces and increases the performance of the AECR. Fully stripped argon ions, {gt} 5 enA, were produced and directly identified by the source charge state analyzing system. High charge state ion beams of bismuth and uranium, such as {sup 209 }Bi{sup 51 +} and {sup 238 }U{sup 53 +}, were produced by the source and accelerated by the 88 -Inch Cyclotron to energies above 6 MeV/nucleon for the first time. To further increase the production of high charge state ions to support the nuclear science research programs at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron, an upgrade is taking place to increase the AECR magnetic field strengths and <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios</b> to improve the plasma confinement.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular ways to obtain higher beam intensities in ECR ion sources is to install an {{electrode}} (usually disc) into the plasma chamber. Examined this method in detail we found that majority of the groups observed the beam intensity improvement by supplying a suitable biased voltage to the electrode and an electron current was injected into the plasma. A few groups observed the enhancement, however, when the electrode operated at floating potential - without being an electron donor. Only a few (and sometimes contradictionary) information was found on the optimised properties of the electrodes, i. e. position, dimension, shape, material. In spite of the great success of the "biased-disc" method, the mechanism is still not completely clear. In this contribution, as one step of understanding, we examine what condition we observed the above mentioned two modes. The experiments were performed at the 18 GHz RIKEN and at the 14. 5 GHz ATOMKI ECR ion sources. It was found that effect of the electrode is strongly depends on the local plasma parameters and on the position of the electrode. At certain <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios</b> and electrode positions we needed to negatively bias the electrode and inject electrons into the plasma. The electrode operated as an electron source (Electron Donor ED mode). At higher <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios</b> and other axial positions the electrode works by directly changing the plasma potential dip (Potential Tuner PT mode). These two modes were checked and successfully found both in continuos and in pulsed mode operation.

40|$|The {{straight}} {{field line}} mirror field is a marginally stable, non-axisymmetric magnetic well, {{which could be}} applied to a single cell mirror machine of the 2 XIIB type. A long thin flux tube confinement region has been modeled with zero plasma beta and a paraxial central magnetic flux line [1, 2], and the study has been extended to the first order in the plasma beta [3]. There are important beneficial properties of this vacuum field. The three dimensional marginal minimum B field and the ellipticity of the magnetic flux tube have been obtained analytically. For a given <b>mirror</b> <b>ratio,</b> the maximum ellipticity is smaller than obtained at experimental facilities with a <b>mirror</b> <b>ratio</b> below 5 or so. An additional important result for the marginal minimum B field is that the perpendicular gyro centre drift is zero, and the radial drift component is zero even to the first order in plasma beta and thereby the gyro centre drift surfaces lie on the magnetic flux surfaces, and a locally omnigenious equilibrium is provided.

40|$|Although the Advanced Electron Cyclotron Resonance {{ion source}} has {{produced}} record high charge state beams {{and is now}} in operation with the 88 -Inch Cyclotron, development of a third generation ECR source could provide major new research opportunities at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron.

40|$|The gasdynamic mirror {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a concept which could {{form the basis of}} a highly efficient fusion rocket engine. Gasdynamic mirrors differ from most other mirror type plasma confinement schemes in that they have much larger aspect ratios and operate at somewhat higher plasma densities. To evaluate whether a gasdynamic mirror could indeed confine plasmas in a stable manner for long periods of time, a small scale experimental gasdynamic mirror was built and tested. The objective of this experiment was to determine ranges of <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios</b> and plasma densities over which gasdynamic mirror could maintain stable plasmas. Theoretical analyses indicated that plasma magnetohydrodynamic instabilities were likely to occur during subsonic to supersonic flow transitions in the mirror throat region of the gasdynamic mirror. The experimental evidence based upon data derived from the Langmuir probe measurements seems to confirm this analysis. The assumption that a gasdynamic mirror using a simple mirror geometry {{could be used as a}} propulsion system, therefore, appears questionable. Modifications to the simple mirror concept are presented which could mitigate these MHD instabilities...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the gasdynamic mirror (GDM) fusion {{propulsion}} system is capable of producing specific impulses in excess of 105 seconds and thrusts in the tens of kilonewtons. These propulsive capabilities arise from the ability of this magnetic fusion system to confine a hot plasma long enough to produce fusion energy while allowing a certain fraction of its charged particle population to escape through one end (a magnetic nozzle) to generate thrust. Earlier investigations have revealed that the optimum performance arise from the use of large <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios</b> which require large magnets and result in very massive vehicles. Major contributors to the large mass, in addition to the magnetic fields, are the large radiators required to dispose of waste heat. In this paper we address the question of mass reduction by investigating the role of magnetic field reversal near the mirror region, on the one hand, and the utilization of the liquid droplet radiator design on the other. We find that significant reduction in the mass of the vehicle can be achieved, and a reduction in cost and travel time are the direct beneficiaries of this reduction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For better {{area and}} power efficiencies, rail-to-rail-output {{single-stage}} amplifiers are a potential replacement of their multi-stage counterparts, especially for display applications that entail massive buffer amplifiers in their column drivers. This paper describes a nested-current-mirror (NCM) technique for a single-stage amplifier to achieve substantial enhancements of DC gain, gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew rate (SR). Specifically, NCM is customizable for different mirror steps, and sub <b>mirror</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{to balance the}} performance metrics and capac-itive-load () drivability, avoiding any compensation passives while preserving a rail-to-rail output swing. Analytical treatments of the NCM technique in terms of performance limits and robust-ness reveal that the NCM amplifier can surpass the fundamental power-efficiency limit set by the basic differential-pair (DP) am-plifier. Two prototypes, 3 -step and 4 -step NCM amplifiers, were fabricated in 0. 18 m CMOS for systematic comparison with the DP amplifier. The former represents a robust design exhibiting 72 dB DC gain and 0. 0028 – 0. 27 MHz GBW over 0. 15 – 15 nF with 80 phase margin (PM). The latter embodies an aggressive design attaining 84 dB DC gain and 0. 013 – 1. 24 MHz GBW over 0. 15 – 15 nF with 62 PM. All amplifiers were sized for the same area (0. 0013 mm) and power (3. 6 W).
