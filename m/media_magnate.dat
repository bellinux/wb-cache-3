5000|$|A Wall Street-based {{industrialist}} named Wendell Willkie, who {{had never}} before run for public office, emerged as the unlikely nominee. Willkie, a former Democrat {{who had been a}} pro-Roosevelt delegate at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, was considered an improbable choice. Willkie had first come to public attention as an articulate critic of Roosevelt's attempt to break up electrical power monopolies. Willkie was the CEO of the Commonwealth and Southern power company, and he opposed the federal government's attempts to compete with private enterprise, claiming that the government had unfair advantages over private companies. Willkie did not dismiss all Roosevelt's social welfare programs, and in fact he supported those he believed free enterprise could not do better. Furthermore, unlike the leading Republican candidates, Willkie was a forceful and outspoken advocate of aid to the Allies, especially Britain. His support of giving all aid to the British [...] "short of declaring war" [...] won him the support of many Republicans on the East Coast, who disagreed with their party's isolationist leaders in Congress. Willkie's persuasive arguments impressed these Republicans, who believed that he would be an attractive presidential candidate. Many of the leading <b>media</b> <b>magnates</b> of the era, such as Ogden Reid of the New York Herald Tribune, Roy Howard of the Scripps-Howard chain and John and Gardner Cowles, publishers of the Minneapolis Star and the Minneapolis Tribune, as well as the Des Moines Register and Look magazine, supported Willkie in their newspapers and magazines. Even so, Willkie remained a long-shot candidate; the May 8 Gallup Poll showed Dewey at 67% support among Republicans, followed by Vandenberg and Taft, with Willkie at only 3%.|$|R

The article {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of the political system of Lithuania on the formation of the country’s system of the mass media. Since 2001 the implementation of the state mass media policy has been coordinated by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania. There is no consistent and clear strategy of the mass media policy. Amendments to the law related to the mass media are adopted chaotically. There are no special regulations on the ownership of the mass media in Lithuania. The passive position of the state is useful for the mass <b>media</b> <b>magnates</b> which have acquired significant public power in relation to the state. In 2009 mass media organizations received financial support amounting to 11. 1 million LTL from the state. This amount is twice as much as in 2008. In 2009 – 2010 Lithuanian public institutions were among the major advertisers in the mass media and the leading advertisers in the press. There is increased financial dependence on the state by the mass media. The influence of the state on the economy and content agenda of the mass media is very significant. Members of parliament have proposed law amendments which envisage the formation of the Board of Public Broadcasting (LRT) after each general election. In this way features of patronage to Lithuanian political system are provided. Direct financial support for public broadcasting from the citizens does not exist. The budget of the LRT depends on political will. A classic case of a clientelistic system can be observed: resources are controlled and distributed by the patrons (politicians who represent the state) for the clients (representatives of the public) in exchange of support and deference. In 2009 a social security tax was imposed on the income of journalists that work under author agreements (for the first time since declaration of the state independence). The state exerted its power on the business of the mass media. In 2009 VAT privilege for the press was slashed. VAT was raised from 5 to 21 per cent. Lithuania is one of three EU countries (with Bulgaria and Slovakia) which do not have VAT privileges for the press. In this way mass media organizations are economically weakened which in turn has a negative impact on quality of their content. There are three self-regulation institutions for the mass media in Lithuania. They are established by the state, and not at the initiative of the mass media. Two of the three self-regulation institutions are accountable to Parliament. The self-regulation system is too bureaucratic and inefficient...|$|R
40|$|Ceci n’est pas une critique” {{might well}} be the leitmotiv of Ella and Marion Hepworth Dixon’s {{representations}} of their contemporary art world. It was a world which, thanks to their upbringing and artistic training, they knew {{from both sides of}} the canvas. It was not, however, a world easily accessible to women. As late as 1921 Ella Hepworth Dixon wrote, “In Art, as in Literature, it is only during the last few years that women have become completely emancipated…. For fifty years men have been assiduous in assuring women that they had no creative talent, and that no woman would ever achieve a masterpiece. ” With uncharacteristic solemnity, she concludes, “It was a depressing period. ” (Lady’s Pictorial. January 29, 1921, p. 140). Ella (1857 - 1932) and Marion (1856 - 1936) were the younger daughters of William Hepworth Dixon (1821 – 1879), for many years the renowned, or notorious, editor of The Atheneaum, then the leading literary journal. Such a “literary lion” was naturally in contact with the most eminent members of the higher echelons of London society and, to quote from the Sunday Times’ review of Ella Hepworth Dixon’s memoirs, “celebrities of all kinds used to go to their house in Regent’s Park”. (Sunday Times, March 30, 1930, p. 11) Their mother also appears to have been a remarkable woman in her own right, as, according to the above-mentioned memoirs, she “went to all Ibsen’s plays (by herself) when they were first produced; and was almost the first woman in London to call in a woman doctor when my youngest brother, Sydney, was born. It was she who presented me, on my return from school-days in Germany, with a petition to sign for women’s suffrage”. (As I Knew Them, p. 14) It is hardly surprising that such parents brought their children up in rather avant-garde ways, in particular giving to their daughters the same education as to their sons. Ella and Marion Hepworth Dixon, therefore, grew up surrounded by artists, sometimes even serving as models, and, at a time when for women of their class marriage was seen as the ultimate career, they initially intended to pursue artistic careers. To this end, they trained in London and Paris, and in the late 1870 s/early 1880 s exhibited works, watercolours and oils, notably at the Society of Lady Artists. For various reasons, however, primarily in order to earn a living, they were thereafter obliged to exchange their paint brushes for pens. Nevertheless, the world of Art remained omnipresent in their lives and in their writing. Even in her last published work, her memoirs, Ella Hepworth Dixon actually introduces herself in the “Foreword” as both an object of art, a portrait, and as a practising artist. Indeed, she continually drew on her knowledge of art and artists for both her fiction and her non-fiction, not always, it has to be acknowledged, in the most respectful fashion. Her background provided her with the necessary insight to see through the artifices of the artistic world, whilst her witty pen enabled her to draw memorable portraits of both the producers and the consumers of art/Art. For example, at the beginning of My Flirtations (1892), Margaret Wynman, the first-person narrator, declares, “Father is a Royal Academician, and paints shocking bad portraits, but the British public is quite unaware of the fact. ” Moreover, even when not dealing with artistic topics, Ella Hepworth Dixon’s prose reveals her painter’s fine eye for detail and colour. In careers which spanned more than four decades, Ella and Marion Hepworth Dixon met and worked with most of the luminaries of their day including Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Aubrey Beardsley, H. G. Wells, George Meredith, Sarah Bernhardt, Cecily Hamilton, Elizabeth Robins, as well as <b>media</b> <b>magnates</b> such as William Heinemann and Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe. They were alternately journalists, critics, essayists and fiction-writers, contributing to various prestigious periodocals and publications such as The Yellow Book. Ella Hepworth Dixon even became that rara avis a woman Editor of a woman's magazine, albeit for a very short time, before also trying her hand at drama. Such multiplicity of output was not then uncommon; many eminent men and women of letters, better known today for one aspect of their writing, engaged in a wide variety of literary enterprises. What is more significant is that at the same time as the fourth estate, and consequently mass media as we know it, was developing as never before, when transmitting information and news became secondary to selling an image, women were entering spheres previously considered beyond their bounds, and enjoying a certain success. Such changes in woman’s ascribed, prescribed and proscribed roles were not always greeted with enthusiasm by either sex. In this paper I would like to explore the ways in which, to use Ella Hepworth Dixon’s own words, she and her sister managed, like “Michael Field”, “to make (their) way in the world and compete with men”...|$|R

25|$|In 2004, Fiona Buffini {{directed}} a touring production for the RSC. Premiering at the Swan, the production starred Alex Avery as Valentine, Laurence Mitchell as Proteus, Vanessa Ackerman as Julia and Rachel Pickup as Silvia. Buffini set the {{play in a}} swinging 1930s milieu, and featuring numerous dance numbers. Additionally, London and New York replaced Verona and Milan; initially, Valentine and Proteus are shown as living in the English countryside, in a rural paradise devoid of any real vitality, the sons of wealthy families who have retired from the city. When Valentine leaves, he heads to New York to pursue the American Dream and {{falls in love with}} Silvia, the famous actress daughter of a powerful <b>media</b> <b>magnate.</b> Another change to the play was that the roles of the outlaws (represented here as a group of paparazzi) were increased considerably. Scenes added to the play show them arriving in New York and going about their daily business, although none of the new scenes featured any dialogue. Another performance worth noting occurred at the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford in 2006. A non-professional acting company from Brazil, named Nós do Morro, in collaboration with a Gallery 37 group from Birmingham, gave a single performance of the play during the RSC's presentation of the Complete Works, directed by Guti Fraga. The production was spoken in Portuguese, with the original English text projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. It also featured two 17-year-olds in the roles of Valentine and Proteus (usually, actors in their 20s are cast), and Crab was played not by a dog, but by a human actor in a dog costume. In 2009, Joe Dowling directed the play at the Guthrie Theater, starring Sam Bardwell as Valentine, Jonas Goslow as Proteus, Sun Mee Chomet as Julia and Valeri Mudek as Silvia.
