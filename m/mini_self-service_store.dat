40|$|Availability of safe, edible food is essential. Food {{shortage}} {{has caused}} many wars and encouraged people {{to try to}} preserve food for a longer time, allowing storage and transport, often {{in some kind of}} package/container. The USA showed the way in developing the food sector and already prior to the 2 nd World War they had <b>self-service</b> <b>stores</b> filled with packed goods. Europe, however, had to wait to apply the US ideas until after the war. As Sweden did not take part, the country got a head start, although with restricted imports and exports and rationing of some food. When self-service retail and new food products, particularly frozen food, became available in the 1950 s, the role of packaging and distribution became important, providing mass-produced food at reasonable prices. The country took the lead in frozen food in Europe and became the origin of some quite successful packaging companies and distribution/equipment suppliers, starting up as local supporting companies to the food sector but then expanding into Europe in order to grow. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the key drivers in society, in the food industry and elsewhere that have affected the development of food-retail packaging, with Sweden as an example of a lead country in Europe for some years after WW II. The study is qualitative and based on semi-structured interviews with experts in the field. The results clearly indicate that frozen food technology and the introduction of <b>self-service</b> <b>stores</b> at about the same time and mainly later chilled/fresh food are the three developments that are considered to have had the most profound influence on the food sector development. Packages were considered as a consequence of the appearance of frozen or chilled food and <b>self-service</b> <b>stores</b> by the interviewees and not as very important in itself, even though neither frozen/chilled food nor <b>self-service</b> <b>stores</b> would exist without packaging and efficient distribution.
