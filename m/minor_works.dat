5|$|The first {{translation}} into English, with {{an introduction}} and parallel Greek and English texts, {{was made by}} Sir Arthur Hort (1864–1935). It was published simultaneously by William Heinemann in London and G. P. Putnam's Sons in New York, as a two-volume book Theophrastus Enquiry into Plants and <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> on odours and weather signs in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> {{took place}} during the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E

5|$|The chronological list of Burges's major {{buildings}} {{is believed}} to be complete, although some <b>minor</b> <b>works,</b> or minimal additions to pre-existing structures, have not been included. The list of furniture and other works is selective. No listing is given of his extensive creations of jewellery, metalwork and stained glass. Crook has a comprehensive, chronological, appendix of Burges's work with indications as to whether the work is still in situ, was never executed, has been removed elsewhere, has been demolished or where the present location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Maynard Solomon summarises the Italian {{journeys}} {{as a great}} triumph, but {{suggests that}} from Leopold's standpoint they also incorporated a great failure. The Mozarts had certainly profited financially, and Wolfgang had developed artistically, into a recognised composer. Although the Mozarts' reception had not been uniformly cordial—they had been cold-shouldered by the Neapolitan court and the Prince of Thurn and Taxis had snubbed them—the Italians had generally responded with enthusiasm. Wolfgang had been received and knighted by the Pope; he had been granted membership in leading philharmonic societies and had studied with Italy's greatest music scholar, Giovanni Martini. Above all, he had been accepted as a practitioner of Italian opera by a leading opera house, completing three commissions that resulted in acclaimed performances. Other compositions resulted from the Italian experience, including a full-scale oratorio, several symphonies, string quartets, and numerous <b>minor</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
25|$|Under the Local Authorities Act 1902, {{divisions}} were renamed shires, and on 31 March 1903, Thuringowa Division {{became the}} Shire of Thuringowa. The period up to 1918 {{was one of}} consolidation and <b>minor</b> <b>works,</b> rather than major projects.|$|E
25|$|In Vienna Gluck wrote a {{few more}} <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> but he {{generally}} lived in retirement. In 1781 he brought out a German version of Iphigénie en Tauride and other operas of his enjoyed great popularity in Vienna.|$|E

25|$|Work on the {{expansion}} started in 1913 {{and it was}} barely finished when World War I broke out. During the war {{it was possible to}} do only <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> such as the power house and the chimney stack that became a prominent characteristic of the building complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{airfield}} {{was taken}} into use in late 1944, although <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> continued {{until the end of}} the war in May 1945. Both a runway, measuring , and a taxiway were built, along with auxiliary buildings, barracks, hangars, storehouses and workshops. The concrete for the runway was of poor quality and caused problems with frost heaving.|$|E
25|$|Among Heller’s many <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> are sermons and responsa. He {{also wrote}} {{two sets of}} piyyutim. The first set, from 1621, commemorates the Defenestration of Prague and the {{beginning}} of the Thirty Years' War; and the escape of the Prague Jews from the sack of Prague by Habsburg troops after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. The second set of poems, written in 1650, commemorate the Cossack massacres of 1648-1649.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{was nearly}} {{complete}} {{by the second}} quarter of 2013, with only <b>minor</b> <b>work</b> remaining. In late September, New Jersey Transit announced that the station would open in mid-October. Both levels of the station opened to passenger service on October 14, 2013.|$|R

5000|$|The Descent of Mary (Γεννα Μαριας or [...] "Genna Marias") is a <b>minor</b> <b>work</b> of the New Testament apocrypha {{which is}} only known through mention in the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, who gives a short passage. Epiphanius {{attributes}} the tale to the Gnostics.|$|R
25|$|His comedy {{combines}} the mock-Gothic with the Aristophanic. He suffers from that dramatist's faults and, {{though not as}} daring in invention or as free {{in the use of}} sexual humour, shares many of his strengths. His greatest intellectual love is for Ancient Greece, including late and <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> such as the Dionysiaca of Nonnus; many of his characters are given punning names taken from Greek to indicate their personality or philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus is {{considered}} to {{have been among the}} most important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy. He was also the last innovative astronomer before Claudius Ptolemy, a mathematician who worked at Alexandria in Roman Egypt in the 2nd century. Ptolemy's works on astronomy and astrology include the Almagest, the Planetary Hypotheses, and the Tetrabiblos, as well as the Handy Tables, the Canobic Inscription, and other <b>minor</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
25|$|Work {{continued}} after Finnart's execution for treason in 1540, {{under the}} superintendence of the parson of Dysart, but {{came to a}} halt in 1542 on the death of James V, although <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> continued into the 1560s. During the crisis of the Scottish Reformation the castle was surrendered by negotiation to James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault as leader of the Lords of the Congregation. Two English captains, Dethick and Wood, then took possession on Easter Day, 15 April 1560.|$|E
50|$|Hiero (Greek: Ἱέρων, Hiéron) is a <b>minor</b> <b>work</b> by Xenophon, set as a {{dialogue}} between Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, and the lyric poet Simonides about 474 BC. In it Xenophon argues that a tyrant {{does not have any}} more access to happiness than a private person.|$|R
50|$|This {{story can}} be {{considered}} a <b>minor</b> <b>work</b> of Balzac, who is not particularly known for his achievements in the genre of melodrama. His talent as a portraitist, however, shines through in the character of Caroline, a talent he displayed and refined throughout the writing of La Comédie humaine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{delegations}} from the Council the staff deal with areas of {{responsibility of the}} organisation {{not covered by the}} committees, mainly the processing of applications for <b>minor</b> <b>work</b> on heritage resources.

25|$|The {{restoration}} {{will involve}} restoring the six {{places where the}} canal is culverted (including the three places where the M6 motorway construction blocked the route), restoring Hincaster Tunnel, restoring the 5 dry miles, and a new crossing of the A590 road near Kendal, {{as well as many}} more <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> including work on 52 listed structures. The extensive engineering required will be expensive (a 2002 estimate being £60 million), and so restoration is planned to proceed in phases.|$|E
25|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the Art Students' League of Philadelphia comes from Charles Bregler, who was a student for the school's whole 7-year existence. He {{remained}} a lifelong friend to Eakins and his wife, and wrote two lengthy articles in the 1930s about Eakins's teaching methods. He preserved an enormous trove of Eakins papers, memorabilia, and <b>minor</b> <b>works,</b> although it was unavailable to scholars until the 1980s. The Bregler Collection was bought by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} the city's last major Neoclassical project. Even as the {{building}} was being completed, new architectural styles {{had already begun to}} emerge. For example, the Cristoforis Gallery with its glass and wrought iron facing was completed in 1832. Thus, apart from a few minor eclectic works, San Carlo al Corso can be said to be the city's last Neoclassical venture. The <b>minor</b> <b>works</b> include the church of Sant'Antonio Abate, the facade and the interiors of San Gottardo in Corte and, above all, Andrea Appiani's frescoes in Santa Maria presso San Celso.|$|E
5000|$|La città sconvolta: caccia spietata ai rapitori (internationally {{released}} as Kidnap Syndicate) is a 1975 Italian poliziottesco directed by Fernando Di Leo.
