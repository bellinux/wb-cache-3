5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, the District and the Met saw {{increased}} competition in central London from the new electric deep-level tube lines. With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To reduce {{labor costs}} {{and the amount of}} {{computer}} time in the design of linear synchronous motors with excitation from a source of a constant magnetic field of high-speed ground transportation it is necessary to use engineering methods. The {{purpose of this study is}} to confirm the adequacy of the previously proposed mathematical model of this engine and assumptions. It is also intended to confirm the possibility of applying the method of calculation of traction that occurs in the engine in the interaction of the permanent magnetic field of the excitation system of a vehicle with a coil track structure. Methodology. As for empirical theories the positive result of the experiment is not absolute proof of the truth, for an unambiguous conclusion about the adequacy of the developed model and the effectiveness of the developed methods need to be tested for falsification. In accordance with this criterion, it is necessary to conduct an experiment, the results of which will coincide with the calculation but you also need to avoid errors caused by random coincidences. For this purpose the experiments with varying parameters are conducted. Findings. In a critical experiment configuration changes of the excitation system were held so that the shape dependence of traction from displacement is differed significantly. The comparison of the results of the calculated and experimental values of traction for different configurations showed that the differences are minor and easily explained by measurement error and uneven gaps between the poles and excitation coils of the track structure. Originality. The adequacy of the mathematical model of a linear synchronous motor without a ferromagnetic magnetic circuit and the assumptions and applicability of the calculation <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> forces involved in it, at the interaction of a permanent magnetic field of the excitation system of a vehicle with a coil track structure were proved. This proof is built on conducting a critical experiment by comparing the calculated and experimentally obtained values of the magnitude of traction for different structures of the linear synchronous motor. Practical value. The adequacy of the mathematical model of a linear synchronous motor of high-speed transport with the excitation of the DC magnetic field and the accepted assumptions is proved in this paper. The author also proved the applicability of the method of calculation of traction that occurs in it, the interaction of static magnetic field of the excitation system of a vehicle with a coil track structure. The use of this technique will reduce the amount of labor and machine time for the design of linear synchronous motors from the DC magnetic field of high-speed ground transportation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{longitudinal}} braking {{dynamics of}} a two-wheel vehicle model on an incline are considered using techniques from nonlinear dynamics. The model is planar and incorporates the coupled dynamics of two independently braked wheels and the vehicle body, and {{takes into account}} the slip dynamics of each wheel. By using the wheel slip values and the vehicle speed as dynamic states, it is shown that the qualitative behavior of the system can be completely captured by studying a relatively simple phase plane problem described in terms of the slip values. A systematic bifurcation analysis is carried out in which the brake torques of the two wheels are varied, and it is shown how the system transitions from stable braking to the possibility of lockup in one or both wheels, to guaranteed lockup in both wheels. In this manner a quite complete picture of the dynamic behavior is obtained {{as a function of the}} two brake torques, including regions with multiple possible steady braking outcomes, depending on the initial conditions. This analysis provides new insights into the dynamics of vehicle braking, and it provides a correction to the standard result for the critical values of the brake torques at which the wheels undergo lockup. This approach may also prove useful for evaluating brake proportioning schedules, or for investigating anti-lock braking systems and other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> control...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} {{operational}} characteristics of freight diesel-electric locomotives ER 20 CF and 2 М 62 м, which are operated with Lithuanian Railways. Important problems on traction calculations are considered in this article. In this article the critical tasks <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> calculations are solved. It {{is the main}} computational tool in the rational functioning, planning and development of railways: determination of the estimated weight of the rolling stock, the diagrams construction of specific resultant forces of a train, the permitted speed definition of the train on the slopes, curves of train traffic construction on the section. Methodology. Using the rules and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>traction</b> calculations {{the analysis of the}} basic operational characteristics of the modernized freight diesel-electric locomotive 2 М 62 m and freight passenger dual locomotive 2 ER 20 CF was held. The maximum weight of the train set, the track structure on a high-speed ascent through the use of kinetic energy (with traction and without traction), technical speed, acceleration force and the value of the smallest radius curve are selected as controlled parameters. During the calculations it was considered that the trains were formed of a fully loaded four-axle gondola cars, model 112 - 119 (feature- 606) with axle load of 23. 5 t; the motion was carried out on the continuous welded rail track; the front of the train set is a dual locomotive 2 ER 20 CF or two locomotive 2 М 62 м. Longitudinal profile of the road on the route Vilnus–KlF was analyzed for the choice of theoretical rise. Inspection concerning the possibility of overcoming the high-speed rise was performed with an analytical method, based {{on the use of the}} kinetic energy accumulated by the overcoming of «light» elements of the profile. Findings. In the calculations, the maximum weight of the train set taking into account theoretical rise was analyzed. The inspection of the theoretical weight of the train set on a reliable short rise of slope that is larger than the theoretical one was carried out. Values of the acceleration force depending on the speed of the train and parameters of the longitudinal profile, values of the smallest curve radius depending on the movement speed, which are developed by the different locomotives in the traction mode, were accessed. Originality. The analysis of the operational parameters of the modernized locomotive 2 М 62 м and dual diesel locomotive of new generation 2 ER 20 CF was held. The maximum weight of the composition, technical speed, the accelerating force and the value of the smallest radius curve were selected as controlled parameters. Practical value. The obtained results can be used for more efficient operation of locomotives on Lithuanian Railways...|$|R
40|$|Supracondylar {{fractures}} of the humerus {{in children}} are frequent. The fractures so designated {{are in the}} supracondylar area of the humerus just proximal to the el-bow, and do not directly involve the joint or the distal humeral epiphysis. Prior to this study, these fractures were treated routinely at the Naval Hospital, San Diego, by the method described by Dunlop. This study was prompted by a patient who sus-tamed her fracture in early August 1 968 and was treated by Dunlop’s <b>traction.</b> The appearance <b>of</b> her elbow when the result was evaluated in December 1 968, some four months after injury, was unsatisfactory to her parents. At that time a retrospec-tive review of all supracondylar fractures treated at this institution {{in the recent past}} was initiated, and the literature was also reviewed to determine the outcome of pa-tients treated by this method and others. Beginning in January 1 969, a slightly modi-fled <b>method</b> <b>of</b> Dunlop’s <b>traction</b> and a specific <b>method</b> <b>of</b> roentgenographic analysis were utilized in the treatment of all subsequent patients with this injury. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the experience at the Naval Hospital during the six-year period from October 1, 1 964, to September 3 1, I 970, with dis...|$|R
