40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The {{study of}} teeth {{has been a}} central tenet in {{biological}} anthropology {{since the inception of}} the field. Teeth have been previously shown to have a high genetic component. The high heritability of teeth has allowed researchers to use them to answer a myriad of anthropological questions ranging from human origins to modern variation due to microevolution. Traditionally, teeth have been studied either morphologically, through the assignment of nonmetric character states, or metrically, through mesiodistal and buccolingual crown measures. Increasingly, geometric morphometric techniques are being used to answer anthropological questions, especially dentally. However, regardless of analytical technique utilized, the biological affinity of modern U. S. individuals has often been limited to examination under a forensic lens (classification of either American Asian, black, Hispanic, or white) without consideration of parent populations. The current study uses geometric morphometric techniques on human molars for two main goals: 1) to examine biological affinity of each of the four largest population groups in regard to population history; and 2) examine the variation within and among the four modern groups as a means of classification. A total of 1, 225 dentitions were digitized. Each of the four modern U. S. groups was compared to possible parental groups via discriminant function analysis (DFA). Additionally affinity was examined using <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>distances</b> (D²) wherein significance of distances between groups was calculated via permutation tests. Furthermore, the D² values were subjected to principal coordinate analysis, or classical multidimensional scaling, to visualize group similarity and dissimilarity. Each group demonstrated affinity with potential parental groups and geographically similar groups as expected given population histories; however, each was also significantly unique from the comparison groups. The four modern U. S. groups were then compared to one another using the same statistical tests. Total among-group correct classifications ranged from 33. 9 - 55. 5 %, indicating a greater classification than random chance (25 %). These classifications were negatively correlated with the reported intermarriage rates for each group: American whites and blacks have the lowest intermarriage rates, which resulted in the highest correct classifications. Conversely, American Asians and Hispanics have the highest intermarriage rates, which resulted in the lowest total correct classifications. Still, the DFA model created from the modern U. S. sample was able to accurately classify a holdout sample. Lastly, a comparison of the three most abundant groups in the U. S. (black, Hispanic, and white), achieved a total correct classification of 72. 3 %, which is comparable to other studies focusing on the same populations.

Genetic divergence, based in 25 characteristics, was estimated by the <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>distance</b> and by two grouping methods, the Tocher’s grouping and the hierarchical nearest neighbor. Large genetic variability was detected among the clones, which were then grouped into seven heterotic clusters by the two methods. There was good agreement {{in the formation of the}} groups for the two methods. The occurrence of small genetic distances among some clones and the inclusion of more than a clone into a specific group indicate that it might be occurring duplication among the evaluated genotypes might be occurrin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate, through meta-analysis, the forage characteristics of various species of the genus Paspalum and to use them to select the best ecotypes that can be used in artificial hybridization as parents and hybrids for pasture production and natural pasture recovery systems. Data were obtained from studies conducted by the Department of Forage Plants and Agrometeorology of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. Database comprised tests conducted with ecotypes and/or hybrids of Paspalum spp. in plots for evaluating total dry mass production, leaf dry mass production, and stem dry mass production by means of cuts. Total dry mass production, which included leaves and stems, differed between the ecotypes and hybrids. Hybrid H 12 was the most divergent of all evaluated accessions. The greatest genetic divergence occurred due to dry mass production. Hybrids showed high total dry mass production, comprised mainly of leaves. Hybrid H 12 and the accession of Paspalum lepton 28 E were identified as the most dissimilar based on the <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance</b> using Tocher’s method. Total dry mass production is the characteristic that most contributed to the detection of genetic variability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the variability and expression {{of the components of}} seed yield in twenty-three apomictic Paspalum plicatulum × Paspalum lepton hybrids and two male parent plants (P. lepton). We used a randomized block design with genotypes individually arranged into ten blocks. The variables were: number of total tillers/plant, number of vegetative tillers/plant, number of reproductive tillers/plant, percentage of reproductive tillers, number of racemes/inflorescence, number of seeds/inflorescence, weight of a thousand seeds, and seed yield. We assessed genetic variability using multivariate procedures: <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance,</b> Tocher's clustering optimization method, and quantification of the relative contribution of the variables. The quantification of variability, based on the components of seed yield of Paspalum plicatulum × Paspalum lepton hybrids, allows the formation of six groups of genotypes using Tocher's method, with high means for the characteristics studied. Weight of a thousand seeds and number of seeds/inflorescence were the traits that most contributed to the genetic dissimilarity. Genetic crosses involving genotype 10 E 5052 from group VI and 10 E 4071 from group V could be undertaken to isolate high yielding segregants, since these genotypes have high seed yielding potential...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{simulation}} study {{of one of the}} well-known hierarchical cluster analysis methods applied to classifying the statistical populations. In particular, the problem of clustering the univariate normal populations is studied. Two measures of the distance between statistical populations are considered: the Mahalanobis distance measure which is defined for normally distributed populations under assumption that the covariance matrices are equal and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (the so called <b>Generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>Distance)</b> the use of which is extended on populations of any distribution. The simulation study is concerned with the set of 15 univariate normal populations, variances of which are chanched during successive steps. The aim is to study robustness of the nearest neighbour method to departure from the variance equality assumption when the Mahalanobis distance formula is applied. The differences between two cluster families, obtained for the same set of populations but with the different distance matrices applied, are studied. The distance between both final cluster sets is measured by means of the Marczewski-Steinhaus distance.

40|$|Diplopods {{belonging}} to the subclass Helminthomorpha may present one or both leg pairs of the seventh diplosegment modified into structures that aid copulation, called gonopods. These structures are used as a taxonomic trait for the description of most species. In the genus Rhinocricus these structures are closely similar, {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish species only on the basis of this trait. Two species, R. padbergi and R. varians, are found in the same habitat and present gonopods practically identical in shape; together they present a broad colour gradient, ranging from dark brown to light beige. Morphometric data for individuals of the experimental group were submitted to ANOVA and MANOVA, using Hotelling-Lawley Trace and <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distances</b> (D 2) tests. The results demonstrated a relationship between size and colour, with darker individuals being larger. On the basis of this preliminary analysis, we may suggest that the two species are distinct since dark individuals are distant from medium- and light-coloured individuals according to the D 2 values. This seems to indicate a possible polymorphism of individuals {{belonging to}} R. padbergi which present close proximity in the values obtained. In all analyses, we observed that the main variables were diameter, length and telson size...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} method {{for evaluating the}} stability and adaptability of maize hybrids using a genotype-ideotype distance index (GIDI) for selection. Data from seven variables were used, obtained through evaluation of 25 maize hybrids at six sites in southern Brazil. The GIDI was estimated {{by means of the}} <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance</b> for each plot of the test. We then proceeded to GGE biplot analysis in order to compare the predictive accuracy of the GGE models and the grouping of environments and to select the best five hybrids. The G × E interaction was significant for both variables assessed. The GGE model with two principal components obtained a predictive accuracy (PRECORR) of 0. 8913 for the GIDI and 0. 8709 for yield (t ha− 1). Two groups of environments were obtained upon analyzing the GIDI, whereas all the environments remained in the same group upon analyzing yield. Coincidence occurred in only two hybrids considering evaluation of the two features. The GIDI assessment provided for selection of hybrids that combine adaptability and stability in most of the variables assessed, making its use more highly recommended than analyzing each variable separately. Not all the higher-yielding hybrids were the best in the other variables assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the genetic diversity of cultivars in sugar cane for resistance to D. saccharalis. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the laboratory in completely randomized design with 11 treatments (one control and 10 treatments) in ten replications. The replications were made from artificial diets (food and refood) made with dry steam crushed from sugar cane cultivars stems, except for one of them considered standard diet. The cultivars used were: RB 867515, RB 855453, RB 855536, CTC 15, CTC 9, SP 80 - 1842, SP 79 - 1011, SP 89 - 1115, SP 81 - 3250 and SP 87 - 365. In the evaluation biological characteristics of the insect considered were: larval development (days), larval viability (%), pupal development (days), pupal weight (g), pupal viability (%), period of hatched larvae to adults emergence (days), total viability (%) and adults longevity without food (days). The <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance</b> (D- 2) for the cluster analysis by the method of average linkage between groups (UPGMA) and Tocher's method optimization was determined. Four and five groups were formed, respectively, by the method of average linkage between groups (UPGMA) and Tocher's method optimization. We concluded that the cultivar CTC 15 standed out as highly susceptible to D. saccharalis, while the cultivar SP 87 - 365 behaved as moderately resistant by antibiosis to D. saccharalis...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{similarity}} {{assessment is}} an important task {{in the context of}} patient cohort identification for comparative effectiveness studies and clinical decision support applications. The goal is to derive clinically meaningful distance metric to measure the similarity between patients represented by their key clinical indicators. How to incorporate physician feedback with regard to the retrieval results? How to interactively update the underlying similarity measure based on the feedback? Moreover, often different physicians have different understandings of patient similarity based on their patient cohorts. The distance metric learned for each individual physician often leads to a limited view of the true underlying distance metric. How to integrate the individual distance metrics from each physician into a globally consistent unified metric? We describe a suite of supervised metric learning approaches that answer the above questions. In particular, we present Locally Supervised Metric Learning (LSML) to learn a <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance</b> that is tailored toward physician feedback. Then we describe the interactive metric learning (iMet) method that can incrementally update an existing metric based on physician feedback in an online fashion. To combine multiple similarity measures from multiple physicians, we present Composite Distance Integration (Comdi) method. In this approach we first construct discriminative neighborhoods from each individual metrics, then combine them into a single optimal distance metric. Finally, we present a clinical decision support prototype system powered by the proposed patient similarity methods, and evaluate the proposed methods using real EHR data against several baselines. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The use {{of genetic}} {{divergence}} {{as a basis}} for identifying superior individuals, with greater heterozygosity, is important in view of the difficulty when selecting of dissimilar genotypes exhibiting high average for interest traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the genetic divergence and the expression of seed production traits in seventeen apomictic Paspalum plicatulum × Paspalum guenoarum hybrids and two male parents (P. guenoarum). A randomized block design was used, with genotypes individually arranged into ten blocks. The following traits were assessed: total number of tillers/plant (TT), reproductive tiller/plant (RT), number of racemes per inflorescence (NRI), reproductive tiller height (RTH), inflorescence rachis length (IRL), number of seeds/inflorescence (NSI), weight of a thousand seeds (WTS) and seed production (SP). Genetic divergence among the genotypes was estimated using the Tocher method and UPGMA clustering, based on the <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance</b> (D 2 ii’). The Tocher and UPGMA optimization methods showed high concordance. The traits that most contributed to genetic divergence were RTH (23. 59 %), IRL (21. 63 %), WTS (16. 67 %) and SP (14. 23 %). The presence of genetic diversity made it possible to identify divergent genotypes and those with high means for the traits studied, allowing the selection of genotypes with significant breeding potential. Repeated cross-breeding of female superior plants with the genotypes Azulão and H 20 can result in a high heterosis effect on seed production characteristics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to examine the past, current and potential influence {{of global climate change}} on the spatial distribution of some commercially exploited fish and to evaluate a recently proposed new ecological niche model (ENM) called nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN). This new technique is based on {{a modified version of the}} test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the <b>generalized</b> <b>Mahalanobis</b> <b>distance.</b> The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A 2 and B 2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated...|$|R
