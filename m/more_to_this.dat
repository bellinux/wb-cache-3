In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling {{to find out who}} committed the murder and how the crime was committed. Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> case than meets the eye.|$|E

25|$|Speculation {{explaining}} {{a relationship}} between birth weight and maternal pelvis size has been proposed. The explanation, based on Darwinian-inspired logic, states that {{since the advent of}} successful Caesarean birth more mothers with small pelvises and babies with large birth weights survive. This hypothesis would predict an increased average birth weight, which has been observed. It is unclear what component contributes <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> effect; evolution or environment.|$|E

25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things {{if he or she}} is chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E

At the time, Woolfolk said: [...] "There's a lot <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> than just passing a law. Kids are using steroids and they are doing so at dangerous levels. ... I've been there. I've watched it. Once you've watched it, you have more of a commitment to get the kids off of the steroids. It's not just a business for me. It's a passion of mine."

500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} season in late May 2009, actor Kirk Acevedo {{announced}} he was [...] "fired" [...] off of the show from his Facebook page. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner denied it soon after, explaining that [...] "like all things on Fringe, there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> story than meets the eye" [...] and reminded viewers that an alternate version of his character had already appeared in a first season episode. Later that summer at Comic-Con in July he reiterated that [...] "rumors of Charlie's demise are premature," [...] and at the August Television Critics Association press tour he commented about Charlie possibly showing up in the previously visited parallel universe. [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] marked the actor's last appearance in the prime universe. In response to why the character was killed off, Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello reported that the [...] "storyline dictated. Charlie wasn't going to have much to do this season, and rather than waste Kirk's time, they cut him loose". The character's doppelganger from the parallel universe returned in the season finale [...] "Over There".|$|E

The track has been called an [...] "astonishing suicide song" [...] and that [...] "Ocean finds himself dressed in black ('Like I'm ready for a funeral'), tormented by heartbreak and on the verge of driving his car into the sea." [...] The song is a [...] "grim escape fantasy" [...] describing a murder suicide, which [...] "has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk “bleeding” with “broken hearts”. The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby." [...] Pitchfork described the singing as [...] "heart-battered." [...] The Quietus states that the song [...] "makes you realise the ocean means a lot <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> songwriter than the reference to Ocean's Eleven that he's cited in interviews, he is mysterious and tragic." [...] Yahoo! Music stated that [...] "in his calm, ultra controlled tone, Ocean sings about feeling like he's on his way to a funeral as he drives around town in a black suit, and a body in the trunk." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B+", praising Jackman's {{performance}} as [...] "strong, solid entertainment" [...] and [...] "a serious, sometimes dark and deliberately paced story." [...] Christy Lemire, writing for the website of Roger Ebert, said that the film [...] "features some breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters, some of whom register more powerfully than others." [...] Variety film critic Peter Debruge called the film [...] "an entertaining and surprisingly existential digression from his usual X-Men exploits. Though Wolvie comes across a bit world-weary and battle-worn by now, Jackman is in top form, taking the opportunity to test the character’s physical and emotional extremes. Fans might’ve preferred bigger action or more effects, but Mangold does them one better, recovering {{the soul of a}} character whose near-immortality made him tiresome." [...] James Buchanan of TV Guide.com gave it 3 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "A rare comic-to-film adaptation that doesn't sacrifice substance for the sake of thrilling action." [...] Scott Collura of IGN praised the film giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "The Wolverine is a stand alone adventure for the classic character that reminds us that there's <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> genre than universe-building and crossovers. ... story paints a deep and compelling portrait of Logan, a haunted character that Jackman still finds new ways to play all these years later." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt that despite the film's final act [...] "sink into CGI shit", Jackman's performance [...] "still has the juice" [...] and Mangold's directing [...] "shows style and snap." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

For example, Boulez's [...] "complete" [...] recording of Webern's music yielded <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> aesthetic the second time after largely missing it the first; but Eliahu Inbal's rendition of Webern's symphony with the hr-Sinfonieorchester is still far more within {{the spirit of the}} late Romantic performance tradition (which Webern seemingly intended for his music), nearly slowing to half-tempo for the whole of first movement and taking care to delineate and shape each melodic strand and expressive gesture throughout the entirety of the work.|$|E
2500|$|While an {{investigation}} by Brown had been on since March 2014, the story began breaking on Friday afternoon, 24 October 2014. In a tweet just before 4 p.m. EST, citing a [...] "highly credible source within the CBC", Brown {{was the first to}} report on Jian Ghomeshi's [...] "indefinite leave" [...] from the Canadian public broadcaster. Though the CBC immediately denied this via a tweet from its head of public affairs Chuck Thompson, Brown continued tweeting about there being [...] "much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> than I can report at this moment" [...] before further indicating that the situation is unrelated to the recent passing of Ghomeshi's father as many had already assumed. By 5:30 PM EST, the CBC confirmed the news of Ghomeshi's [...] "undetermined leave for personal issues" [...] to The Canadian Press news agency with even Ghomeshi himself tweeting within thirty minutes about [...] "taking some much needed personal time".|$|E
2500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: [...] "I’ve liked episodes {{that focus}} on Krapappel, {{but on the other}} hand, her {{relationship}} with Skinner has always been a bit of a dud. Those two factors cancel each other out to leave this as an average show, though the mockery of EPCOT scores some points. I think the real EPCOT is pretty fun, actually, but the program delivers some amusing pokes at it." [...] "Special Edna" [...] was named the best episode of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons by IGN writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They commented: [...] "First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage [...] But there's a ton <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center [...] that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984." ...|$|E
