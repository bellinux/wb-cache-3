5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering <b>metrology,</b> optical <b>metrology,</b> oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau {{international}} des poids et mesures or BIPM) – {{an international}} <b>metrology</b> centre at Sèvres in France that has {{custody of the}} International prototype kilogram, provides <b>metrology</b> services for the CGPM and CIPM, houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings. Initially its prime metrological purpose was a periodic recalibration of national prototype metres and kilograms against the international prototype.|$|E
5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, {{it is used to}} perform dimensional <b>metrology</b> of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.|$|E

5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science. The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did {{the way in which they}} were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal <b>Metrology</b> (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of <b>metrology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Inter{{national}} Prototype Kilogram (IPK) {{is rarely}} used or handled. Copies of the IPK kept by national <b>metrology</b> laboratories {{around the world}} were compared with the IPK in 1889, 1948, and 1989 to provide traceability of measurements of mass {{anywhere in the world}} back to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|Bureau {{international}} des poids et mesures (BIPM or International Bureau of Weights and Measures), {{a permanent}} laboratory and world centre of scientific <b>metrology,</b> {{the activities of}} which include {{the establishment of the}} basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities, maintenance of the international prototype standards and oversight of regular comparisons between the international prototype and the various national standards.|$|E
5|$|A French-inspired {{initiative}} for international cooperation in <b>metrology</b> {{led to the}} signing in 1875 of the Metre Convention. Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram. A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram, in each case made of a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy, were manufactured by the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co and accepted by the CGPM in 1889. One of each was selected at random to become the International prototype metre and International prototype kilogram that replaced the mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives respectively. Each member state was entitled to one {{of each of the}} remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national <b>metrology</b> laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young to volunteer for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical <b>Metrology</b> and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface <b>metrology,</b> roughness measurement, 3D surface <b>metrology</b> in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Notable {{aerospace}} {{and defense}} companies in Ohio include GE Aviation, Timken, Goodrich Corporation, GE Honda Aero Engines, CFM International, and Aircraft Braking Systems. France-based CIRCOR Aerospace, Inc., which develops systems for aerospace fluid control, has a commercial unit {{located in the}} state. Boeing's Central Ohio Aerospace and Technology Center in Heath is a venture amongst five of the top 10 U.S. defense contractors, including Atlantic Inertial Systems, Honeywell, Kearfott, Northrop-Grumman, L3 Communications, and Raytheon, {{which is also the}} headquarters of the Air Force <b>Metrology</b> and Calibration Program Office. RTI International Metals's location in Niles produces titanium used in every France-based Airbus aircraft. RTI was originally headquartered in Niles before moving to Pittsburgh in the 21st century, while Airbus has invested $4.3 billion in the state. Makino's Global Titanium Research and Development Center is located in Mason. Nextant Aerospace has manufacturing facilities at the Cuyahoga County Airport.|$|E

25|$|The Sumerians {{developed}} a complex system of <b>metrology</b> c. 4000 BC. This advanced <b>metrology</b> {{resulted in the}} creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700 – 2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} written mathematics {{dates back to}} the ancient Sumerians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of <b>metrology</b> from 3000 BC.

The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.|$|E
25|$|In a {{radiation}} <b>metrology</b> laboratory, {{background radiation}} {{refers to the}} measured value from any incidental sources that affect an instrument when a specific radiation source sample is being measured. This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} applications of this technique. One is the optical clock, where an optical frequency is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a photodiode, and a radio frequency is compared to the beat signal, the repetition rate, and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include optical <b>metrology,</b> frequency-chain generation, optical atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} these {{facilities}} support manufacturing and other industrial sectors of the economy. This also permits partnerships and alliances. One {{of the most important}} research center in the state is the National <b>Metrology</b> Center (CENAM), which is a dependency of the Secretariat of Economy. The main function of the center is to bring together science and technology to support the country’s economy. It is the second most important {{of its kind in the}} Americas.|$|E
25|$|Test {{equipment}} {{tends to}} drift {{out of calibration}} over time, and the specified accuracy cannot be relied upon indefinitely. For more expensive equipment, manufacturers and third parties provide calibration services so that older equipment may be recalibrated and recertified. The cost of such services is disproportionate for inexpensive equipment; however extreme accuracy is not required for most routine testing. Multimeters used for critical measurements {{may be part of}} a <b>metrology</b> program to assure calibration.|$|E

25|$|Peirce was {{a working}} {{scientist}} for 30 years, and arguably {{was a professional}} philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on {{a wide array of}} disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, <b>metrology,</b> geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.|$|E
25|$|Outlying campuses {{cater to}} a range of {{research}} activities including crops research, animal reproduction, public health and watershed management. The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) was established in 1888 in accordance with provisions of the Hatch Act of 1887, calling for experiment stations at land-grant universities. State and federal funds support CAES research programs. In 2007, research activities included pest management, food safety and nutrition, environmental quality, plant and animal production systems, and community and rural development. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultra Violet Science and Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, partners industry with Colorado State University, CU-Boulder, and the University of California-Berkeley. The center has three research thrusts in Engineered EUV Sources, Imaging, Patterning, and <b>Metrology,</b> and Novel Linear and Non-Linear Spectroscopies The Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2) is the first research center created under the umbrella of the new Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, involving CSU, CU, Colorado School of Mines, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
