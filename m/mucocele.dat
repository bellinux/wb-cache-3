50|$|A non-surgical {{option that}} may be {{effective}} for a small or newly identified <b>mucocele</b> is to rinse the mouth thoroughly with salt water (one tablespoon of salt per cup) four to six times {{a day for a}} few days. This may draw out the fluid trapped underneath the skin without further damaging the surrounding tissue. If the <b>mucocele</b> persists, individuals should see a doctor to discuss further treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{location}} {{to find a}} <b>mucocele</b> is the inner surface of the lower lip. It {{can also be found}} on the inner side of the cheek (known as the buccal mucosa), on the anterior ventral tongue, and the floor of the mouth. When found {{on the floor of the}} mouth, the <b>mucocele</b> is referred to as a ranula. They are rarely found on the upper lip. As their name suggests they are basically mucus lined cysts and they can also occur in the Paranasal sinuses most commonly the frontal sinuses, the frontoethmoidal region and also in the maxillary sinus. Sphenoid sinus involvement is extremely rare. When the lumen of the vermiform appendix gets blocked due to any factor, again a <b>mucocele</b> can form.|$|E

50|$|The {{lips are}} {{normally}} symmetrical, pink, smooth, and moist. There {{should be no}} growths, lumps, or discoloration of the tissue. Abnormal findings are asymmetricality, cyanosis, a cherry-red or pale color or dryness. Diseases include <b>mucocele,</b> aphthous ulcer, angular stomatitis, carcinoma, cleft lip, leukoplakia, herpes simplex and chelitis.|$|E
50|$|A ranula {{is a type}} of <b>mucocele</b> {{found on}} the floor of the mouth. Ranulas present as a {{swelling}} of connective tissue consisting of collected mucin from a ruptured salivary gland caused by local trauma. If small and asymptomatic further treatment may not be needed, otherwise minor oral surgery may be indicated.|$|E
50|$|A bronchocele is {{a segment}} of {{bronchus}} that is filled with mucus and completely enclosed so the mucus cannot drain out. This segment is usually dilated. It is also called bronchial <b>mucocele.</b> If there is no obstruction to the flow of mucus, it is called mucoid impaction of bronchus. Bronchocele results from obstruction of bronchus. Overproduction of mucus can also contribute. Obstruction could be from scarring, tumor, congenital atresia, etc.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} a <b>mucocele</b> is {{found on the}} palate, retromolar pad, and {{posterior}} buccal mucosa. Known as a [...] "superficial mucocele", this type presents as single or multiple vesicles and bursts into an ulcer. Despite healing after a few days, superficial mucoceles recur often in the same location. Other causes of bumps inside lips are, aphthous ulcer, Lipoma, benign tumors of salivary glands, submucous abscess and haemangiomas.|$|E
50|$|The {{former is}} a {{swelling}} of connective tissue {{consisting of a}} collection of fluid called mucin. This occurs because of a ruptured salivary gland duct usually caused by local trauma (damage), in the case of mucus extravasation phenomenon, and an obstructed or ruptured salivary duct (parotid duct) {{in the case of a}} mucus retention cyst. The <b>mucocele</b> has a bluish translucent color, and is more commonly found in children and young adults.|$|E
5000|$|Ranula — {{the name}} used when a <b>mucocele</b> {{occurs in the}} floor of the mouth (underneath the tongue). Ranulas may grow to a larger size than mucoceles at other sites, and they are usually {{associated}} with the sublingual gland, although less commonly they may also arise from the submandibular gland or a minor salivary gland. Uncommonly, a ranula may descend into the neck rather than the mouth (plunging ranula). If small, the ranula may be left alone, but if larger and causing symptoms, excision of the sublingual gland may be indicated.|$|E
5000|$|A ranula {{is a type}} of <b>mucocele,</b> and {{therefore}} could be classified as a disorder of the salivary glands. Usually a ranula is confined {{to the floor of the}} mouth (termed a [...] "simple ranula"). An unusual variant is the cervical ranula (also called a plunging or diving ranula), where the swelling is in the neck rather than the floor of the mouth. The term ranula is also sometimes used to refer to other similar swellings of the floor of mouth such as true salivary duct cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic hygromas. The Latin word rana means [...] "frog" [...] (ranula = [...] "little frog").|$|E
50|$|Minor {{trauma to}} the floor of the mouth is thought to damage the {{delicate}} ducts that drain saliva from the sublingual gland into the oral cavity. The lesion is a mucous extravasation cyst (<b>mucocele)</b> of the floor of mouth, although a ranula is often larger than other mucoceles (mainly because the overlying mucosa is thicker). They can grow so large that they fill the mouth. The most usual source of the mucin spillage is the sublingual salivary gland, but ranulas may also arise from the submandibular duct or the minor salivary glands in the floor of the mouth. A cervical ranula occurs when the spilled mucin dissects its way through the mylohyoid muscle, which separates the sublingual space from the submandibular space, and creates a swelling in the neck. It may occur following rupture of a simple ranula. Rarely, ranulas may extend backwards into the parapharyngeal space.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mucoceles {{are slowly}} {{expanding}} cystic lesions with respiratory epithelium containing mucus most commonly affecting the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses. They {{are caused by}} obstruction of sinus ostium. Mucoceles exert pressure on the bony boundaries and due to the proximity to the brain and orbit extension to these areas are common. Case presentation A case of a frontal <b>mucocele</b> with an accompanying orbital abscess mimicking a fronto-orbital <b>mucocele</b> is reported. A 77 year old female patient suffering from left sided proptosis and pain around the left eye was admitted to our department. She {{had a history of}} left frontal sinus <b>mucocele</b> one year ago that was offered an osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery that the patient refused. Patient had limitation of eye movements. Fundoscopic examination revealed a minimal papilledema. Coronal computerized tomography and orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed a frontal <b>mucocele</b> with suspicious erosion of the orbital roof and a superiorly localized extraconal mass displacing the orbit lateroinferiorly. Frontal and orbital masses had similar intensities. Thus surgery was planned for a fronto-orbital <b>mucocele.</b> During surgery no defect was found on the orbital roof. Frontal <b>mucocele</b> and orbital cystic mass was removed separately. Pathological examination showed a frontal <b>mucocele</b> and an orbital abscess wall. Postoperatively eye movements returned to normal and papilledema resolved. Conclusion Fronto-orbital mucoceles are commonly encountered pathologies, but frontal <b>mucocele</b> with an orbital abscess is a rarely seen and should be kept in mind because their treatments differ. </p...|$|E
40|$|Appendiceal <b>mucocele</b> {{mimicking}} urolithiasis Appendiceal <b>mucocele</b> {{is a rare}} {{clinical condition}} that results from distension of the appendix lumen with mucus. It is only found in 0. 1 - 0. 3 % of all appendectomy specimens. Twenty-five per cent of these cases are asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered either during surgery or upon radiological examination. The treatment of appendi-ceal <b>mucocele</b> is surgical, and while appendectomy is usually sufficient in some cases right hemicolectomy may {{be considered as a}} treatment option. Mucoceles are histologically subdivided into four types: retention cysts, mucosal hyperplasia, cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas. Herein, we present a case of appendiceal <b>mucocele</b> clinically mimicking urolithiasis in a 62 -year-old female patient with a complaint of colicky right flank pain and a single episode of macroscopic hematuria. The patient’s abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal CT scan showed a mass consistent with <b>mucocele</b> in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Colonoscopy gave the impression of a mass lesion exerting pressure from the outside. The patient was electively operated. Histopathological diagnosis was reported as mucinous cystadenoma. Appendiceal <b>mucocele</b> or mucinous cystadenomas are usually seen in patients undergoing surgery with a diagnosis of appendicitis but, as in our case, these lesions may rarely occur with a clinical picture that mimics urological disease.

40|$|The endonasal microendoscopic {{surgery is}} {{establishing}} itself {{with great success}} {{in the treatment of}} <b>mucocele</b> of the paranasal sinuses. The standard diagnosis of <b>mucocele</b> of the paranasal sinuses is established by means of computertomographie (CT). The treatment of <b>mucocele</b> of the paranasal sinuses and their surgical therapeutic concept is reviewed in the scope of this retrospective study. The study comprised of the examination of 255 patients suffering from 290 <b>mucocele</b> or pyocele of the paranasal sinuses who had undergone surgery in the ENT clinic of Klinikum Fulda gAG between 1983 and 2002. There were 185 patients who in the scope of the study presented themselves for a special clinico-radiological examination. The average follow-up period was 12 years. 170 of the 255 patients involved in the study were men (66. 7 %) and 85 were women (33. 3 %). The mean age of onset was 50. 1 in the men and 54. 1 in the women. Fourteen patients were under 20 years of age. The main symptoms caused by <b>mucocele</b> of the paranasal sinuses in the patients included head ache, swelling of the soft tissue above or in the respective paranasal sinus or periorbital feeling of pressure above the respective paranasal sinus or above the point of emergion of the cranial nerves V/ 2 and V/ 3, disturbed nasal respiration, exophthalmus, diplopia, and hiposmia. Sphenoidal <b>mucocele</b> caused the typical coronal headache, in three cases these were detected due to a vision loss developing into blindness. 125 of the 290 <b>mucocele</b> were located in the frontal sinus (43 %), 72 in the maxillary sinus (25 %), 41 {{in the area of the}} ethmoidal cells (14 %), 29 in the sphenoidal sinus (10 %) and 23 % in the frontoethmoidal region (8 %). The shortest latency period until <b>mucocele</b> occurred was 1 year, the longest was 19 years. Causes for the development of <b>mucocele</b> were previous paranasal sinus surgery in 66 % (78. 7 %  surgical approach according to Jansen/Ritter or Caldwell-Luc), traumata in 14 %, chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses in 2 % and a tumour in 1 % of the cases. The <b>mucocele</b> were marsupialised by means of endonasal endoscopic surgery of the paranasal sinuses in 69. 3 %. With regard to the management of the <b>mucocele</b> in the region of maxillary and frontal sinus, the surgical approach depended on the position of the cele. <b>Mucocele</b> in an extreme lateral position (28. 6 %) were treated by means of osteoplastic surgery. In 4 out of 185 patients (= 2. 2 %), who were followed up, recurrent <b>mucocele</b> occurred. The long-term success rate is 98. 1 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|A <b>mucocele</b> is a mucus {{retention}} {{phenomenon of}} the major and, more commonly, the minor salivary glands.
