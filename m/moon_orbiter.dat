40|$|The Systems Analysis Branch {{performs}} trajectory {{and systems}} analysis for next-generation launch vehicle and space transportation technologies. Currently the branch is supporting the Project Prometheus with analysis of nuclear electric and nuclear thermal propulsion missions {{to a variety}} of destinations. Within Project Prometheus a proposed mission to Jupiter and three of the planet sized icy moons that orbit it is developing. The Jupiter Icy <b>Moons</b> <b>Orbiter</b> (JIMO) as the project is being called will enable detailed scientific investigation of Jupiter's moons Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. These moons were choose to orbit for intensive study in particular because they are each believed to have water, energy, and organic material. The JIMO mission will utilize nuclear fission power and electric propulsion in order to allow the spacecraft to orbit the moons at close range for long durations of time. My assignment this summer was to assist in developing a trajectory analysis for the spacecraft system the Jupiter Icy <b>Moons</b> <b>Orbiter</b> by rewriting an inefficient Excel file into a more efficient FORTRAN program. This program has been created for use planning the trajectory of the Jupiter Icy <b>Moons</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Mission. The program uses a database of thousands of data points representing flight time, burn time, thrust, mass of the propellant used, final mass of the spacecraft, ratio of finals mass to initial mass, and change in velocity that a spacecraft experiences during each phase in the Jupiter Icy <b>Moons</b> <b>Orbiter</b> Mission. The trajectory program is capable of taking a specific user entered specific impulse (isp), final mass fraction, and thrust (P(sub J) /m 0) and through the use of cubic splines to fit specific data curves, the program can locate the exact flight time linked to the user specified values of specific impulse and final over initial mass fraction. Currently, the database used by the program to calculate flight times for a given thrust is only for isps in the range of 2000 to 9000 seconds. Although the program is specific to the Jupiter Icy <b>Moons</b> <b>Orbiter</b> mission, it can be easily modified to fit any mission with a propulsion system expected isp range between 2000 and 9000 seconds. This program performs the same tasks as the old Excel file but in a more timely fashion. Finally, this FORTRAN program will replace the Excel file as the tool used to calculate trajectory properties in missions and will provide valuable data to mission analysts for years to come...|$|R

40|$|Initially {{championed by}} the NASA Office of Education, the American Student <b>Moon</b> <b>Orbiter</b> (ASMO) project offers to next {{generation}} explorers unique opportunities for integral {{involvement in the}} U. S. space exploration program. The ASMO project {{will be carried out}} as a diverse nationwide higher education initiative by which American university students and their faculty advisors will design, build, register, launch and own the ASMO small spacecraft and its payload. The student-built ASMO craft could be launched to orbit the Earth’s Moon in 2011 in tandem with a spacecraft to be developed by European students under a companion European Student <b>Moon</b> <b>Orbiter</b> (ESMO) program. Through coordination with ESA’s ESMO program and possible spacecraft interoperability, valuable opportunities for international scientific and technical collaboration could be offered. Conceived to accommodate a 10 kg payload in a highly elliptical 2 year lunar orbit, there are numerous options for ASMO to serve as a valuable data gathering mission and technology demonstration that will enhance understanding of the lunar environment and advance the small satellite field. Representing a new class of exploration activity whereby the public can directly participate in a NASA mission, the ASMO project is also intended to lower the barrier of entry into space exploration...|$|E

40|$|NASA's {{proposed}} Jupiter Icy <b>Moon</b> <b>Orbiter</b> (JIMO) mission {{currently in}} conceptual development {{is to be}} the first {{one of a series of}} highly capable Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) science driven missions. To understand the implications of a multi-mission capability requirement on the JIMO vehicle and mission, the NASA Prometheus Program initiated a set of parametric high-level studies to be followed by a series of more in-depth studies. The JIMO potential follow-on destinations identified include a Saturn system tour, a Neptune system tour, a Kuiper Belt Objects rendezvous, an Interstellar Precursor mission, a Multiple Asteroid Sample Return and a Comet Sample Return. This paper shows that the baseline JIMO reactor and design envelop can satisfy five out of six of the follow-on destinations. Flight time to these destinations can significantly be reduced by increasing the launch energy or/and by inserting gravity assists to the heliocentric phase...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary navigation and orbit determination analyses for the European Student <b>Moon</b> <b>Orbiter.</b> The severe constraint {{on the total}} mission Delta nu and the all-day piggy-back launch requirement imposed by the limited available budget, led to the choice of using a low-energy transfer, more specifically a Weak Stability Boundary one, with a capture into an elliptic orbit around the Moon. A particular navigation strategy was devised to ensure capture and fulfil the requirement for the uncontrolled orbit stability at the Moon. This paper presents a simulation of the orbit determination process, based on an extended Kalman filter, and the navigation strategy applied to the baseline transfer of the 2011 - 2012 window. The navigation strategy optimally allocates multiple Trajectory Correction Manoeuvres to target a so-called capture corridor. The capture corridor is defined, at each point along the transfer, by back-propagating the set of perturbed states at the Moon that provides an acceptable lifetime of the lunar orbit.
