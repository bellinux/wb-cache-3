5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates <b>moisture</b> content <b>in</b> {{bottom and}} top sills in an {{internally}} insulated basement wall. <b>Moisture</b> and temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall are measured from May 2007 until January 2008. <b>The</b> <b>moisture</b> content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sills are also simulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program WUFI 2 D. During the measurement period, the sills take up very little moisture. Long term simulations with high initial <b>moisture</b> content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction indicate that <b>the</b> sills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall dry out. However, {{this is not}} confirmed by the measurements, partly because of low initial <b>moisture</b> content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sills and a short measurement period. Further, the bottom sill does not dry during the winter season as predicted by the calculations.

5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

Later in the day, the center of the wave became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT satellite pass. By the afternoon, the wave developed into an area of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present.|$|E

40|$|Water uptake in {{fractured}} brick samples {{is monitored}} with X-ray radiography. This technique can measure both <b>the</b> <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix and {{the height of}} <b>the</b> waterfront <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture during the experiment. It was found that <b>the</b> waterfront <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture could quickly reach {{the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> specimen, resulting <b>in</b> an extra water source for the surrounding matrix over the total height of the sample. For smaller fracture apertures, however, <b>the</b> waterfront <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture stagnates and <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix run ahead of <b>the</b> waterfront <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture. To simulate the experiments, a numerical model for unsaturated <b>moisture</b> transport <b>in</b> fractured porous media is developed. The model combines a discrete fracture model for <b>moisture</b> flow <b>in</b> a variable aperture fracture with a finite element model for unsaturated flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> porous matrix. To achieve a stable numerical solution, movable nodes, following <b>the</b> <b>moisture</b> front <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture, are introduced on the boundary of the finite element mesh. The numerical results of height of rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture as well as of <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix show to be in good agreement with the measurements. The paper ends with a parameter analysis, investigating the effects of fracture aperture and matrix properties on <b>the</b> unsaturated <b>moisture</b> flow <b>in</b> fractured porous media.

5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air {{in order for}} them to take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Dora {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off the western African coast on July7. The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without any signs of development. However, the system encountered an enhanced flow of <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwestern Caribbean, allowing for organization and the formation of a broad low-pressure area on July15. Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone. The next day, thunderstorm activity erupted around the system, and at 1500UTC on July18, the NHC declared the vigorous disturbance to have reached tropical depression status; in post-season analysis, the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak strength}} for about 18hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this {{was caused by}} the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye feature to develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085miles (1745km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain <b>moisture.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing {{the formation of a}} low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E
