500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951.

500|$|Diarra {{began the}} 2001–02 season {{by making the}} bench {{in several of the}} team's league matches in August and September, but failing to make an appearance. In October 2001, he was dropped back down to the club's reserve team and {{appeared}} in four matches before earning promotion back to the senior team for its 2001 Intercontinental Cup showdown with Argentine club Boca Juniors. Diarra made the bench for the match, but did not feature as Bayern won the match courtesy of an extra time goal from Samuel Kuffour. The victory gave Diarra his first major honour of his career. Afterwards, he returned to the reserve team and later suffered an injury, which required a lengthy absence. Diarra rejoined the team in March 2002 under new manager Hermann Gerland and made nine more appearances. Following the season, Diarra was offered a new three-year contract with the club, but rejected it citing his limited playing time. Despite his disappointing stint with Bayern, which included failing to make an appearance with the club's senior team, in 2009, Diarra stated [...] "I have very fond memories of <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Bayern". Following Diarra's success at Bordeaux, Bayern's general manager Uli Hoeneß admitted that Diarra's rise to prominence as a footballer is [...] "one of the seven wonders of the world". Hoeneß admitted that he was surprised by Diarra's resurgence stating [...] "If somebody had told me [...] five years ago and made a bet with me, I would have lost a fortune". Since Diarra departing the club in 2002, due to FIFA compensation laws, Bayern have recouped over €800,000 {{as a result of the}} player's future transfers.|$|E
