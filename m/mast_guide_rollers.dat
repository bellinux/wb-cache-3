At the same time, it is acted upon by all kinds of forces, such as tensile and compressive stresses, bending stress, thermal stress. and thus it would affect stability of the steel strip. The finite element model of steel strip and <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> are established, and the ANSYS software is used to study the effects on transverse stress distribution under different strip shapes that contains center buckle, double edge wave, compound buckle, quarter buckle and quality shape.

A wire (1) rotates the two <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> along a portion of its periphery under formation of a wire field (13) with parallel wire sections between the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers.</b> Two auxiliary rollers (3, 4) are arranged in contact with the wire field, where the auxiliary rollers are supported about a rotary axis that is arranged parallel to the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> and at retainers (6 a, 6 b).

25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|R

5000|$|A {{new problem}} with {{chemical}} stability became notable in the mid-seventies when two significant tape manufacturers changed their dispersion formulations by introducing a polyurethane binder that, in time, turned hygroscopic and broke down as it absorbed water molecules {{into the long}} hydrocarbon molecular chains.
