The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers.

5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for fans to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis {{has been placed on}} St George's Cross {{at the expense of the}} traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that there are factors other than true attentional {{abilities}} that might relate to difficulty paying attention.

25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is diagnosed}} on an electrocardiogram (ECG), an investigation performed routinely whenever an irregular heart beat is suspected. Characteristic findings are {{the absence of}} P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R–R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles.
