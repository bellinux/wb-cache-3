Polypropylene (PP) as alinear polyolefin has low melt strength for bubble stabilization and sagging.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{aspect of}} the medium-range {{structure}} of silica drawn into fibers is studied. The network of silica glass structure is composed of corner-shared SiO 4 tetrahedra, {{and it can be}} seen as a structure of interconnected rings (Si-O) n of various size, denoted nMR (n-Membered Ring). Molecular Dynamics simulations show that small-sized silica rings get a preferential orientation during the drawing, either during the high-temperature stage for 3 MR, or during the cooling for 4 MR and 5 MR, and they persist in this state in the fiber at ambient temperature. This leads to a structural anisotropy, more specifically a " transverse isotropy ", because of different longitudinal and transversal physical properties. This anisotropic structural rearrangement during the drawing process induces a non-Newtonian behavior of the modeled glass melt, with strain-rate dependent properties. Highlights: Anisotropy in silica glass comes from the orientation that small silica rings acquire during the deformation. The model is in agreement with experiments (non-Newtonian behavior of the <b>melt,</b> anisotropic <b>elasticity</b> of the fiber). The anisotropy in silica fiber is a " transverse isotropy "...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{crystals}} in the {{elasticity of}} semicrystalline polymers {{is discussed in}} the case of syndiotactic polypropylene, which provides an example of a thermoplastic elastomer with a degree of crystallinity that can be tailored by changing and controlling the stereoregularity.

The comparison of crystallization and physical properties of samples of syndiotactic polypropylene of different stereoregularity, with rrrr pentad concentrations being variable in the wide range 26 - 96 %, prepared with different catalysts, has shown that syndiotactic polypropylenes present different types of elastic behavior, depending on the degree of crystallinity. For the most-stereoregular and crystalline samples with high melting temperatures, crystals actively participate to the elastic response of the material and elasticity has a mainly enthalpic character attributable to the metastability of the trans-planar form III that transforms into the more-stable helical form II during elastic recovery.

The effect of chemical modification on the viscous and elastic properties of LDPE and two blend systems LDPE/ LLDPE (80 : 20, 60 : 40) is reported. Chemical modification which is in essence a free radical process induces changes that increase melt viscosity and <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> of LDPE and the two blend systems.

The sonicated IESBO was tested for morphology, <b>elasticity,</b> <b>melting</b> behavior and chemical composition and compared to those of the non-sonicated IESBO to determine what physical and chemical changes manifest as a consequence of sonication. Application of power ultrasound had significant effects on the physical properties of IESBO. The sonicated IESBO showed smaller crystals and was harder than the non-sonicated IESBO. Sonication increased elasticity (G 2 ̆ 7; storage modulus) of the IESBO from 194. 9 ± 17. 9 to 597. 2 ± 159. 6 Pa. Sonication also affected the melting behavior of the crystallized fat when the melting behavior of sonicated stearin fraction (crystals) was evaluated. Stearin fraction of the sonicated IESBO showed a sharper and narrower peak than that of the non-sonicated IESBO. However, sonication did not affect its chemical composition, which was determined by fatty acid methyl ester compositions of the stearin fractions with and without sonication.

40|$|Foamed cable insulations and {{conductive}} polymer composite fibres are two applications in polymer processing where the electrical properties of a material may be altered significantly during processing. Their common denominator {{is that the}} outcome depends {{to a large degree}} on the flow behaviour of the polymer melt, in particular the melt extensional properties. In communication cables, the speed of propagation can be increased and the power lost in the transmission line decreased by foaming the cable insulation. Measurements on foamed polyethylene at 34 kHz and 11. 2 GHz, using a dielectric spectrometer and a cavity resonance technique respectively, showed that the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss factor decreased with increasing porosity. However, the incorporation of a blowing agent significantly increased the dielectric loss factor. Comparing the loss factors measured at 1. 8 GHz using a split-post dielectric resonator of 8 commercial high density polyethylene grades with the presence of specific molecular groups showed correlations between low dielectric losses and low amounts of carbonyl and trans-vinylene groups. Increasing the conductivity of polymer composite textile fibres may extend their use in various applications like heating, sensing and shielding. Several combinations of conductive fillers and polymers were prepared by melt mixing in a mixing chamber. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) and carbon black (CB) were used as conductive fillers. Conductivity was measured and the melt spinnability was evaluated with a capillary viscometer. Spinnability was closely related to <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> and yield stress phenomena which in turn could be related to the formation of a filler network. The type of MWNT and method of their dispersion had a large influence on <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> and conductivity. Elongation during melt spinning and drawing significantly decreased fiber conductivity. This effect was more pronounced for MWNT than for CB. However, conductivity lost due to elongation could be restored by a heat treatment in case of CB, but not for MWNT.

Considering that the drawdown force is recovered to the original value during the post-processing annealing, the phenomenon is ascribed to the conformation change related to the branch structure, i. e., the alignment of long branches to a backbone chain, which is known as “shear modification”. Further, it is demonstrated that the depression of the drawdown force for B-PP is more significant than that for LDPE. Moreover, it is also clarified that B-PP needs a longer post-processing annealing time to recover the drawdown force than LDPE.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that generally the level of exfoliation in 30 B based nanocomposites was better than 15 A based nanocomposites. In addition, due to difference in hydrophilicity and kind of modifiers in these two clays, the effect of 30 B on refinement of dispersed phase and enhancement of biodegradability of PLA/LLDPE blend was much more remarkable than that of 15 A nanoclay.

Second, due to enhanced <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> (by the presence of long linear chains of linear HDPE polymer), the flow induced molecular weight fractionation is more effective which results in narrow molecular weight distribution of die drool sample containing small amount of long chains.

In particular, puncture-healing upon impact {{has the potential}} to mitigate significant damage caused by high velocity micrometeoroid impacts. This type of material also {{has the potential to}} improve damage tolerance in load bearing structures to enhance vehicle health and aircraft durability. The materials being studied are those capable of instantaneous puncture healing, providing a mechanism for mechanical property retention in lightweight structures. These systems have demonstrated healing capability following penetration of fast moving projectiles [...] velocities that range from 9 mm bullets shot from a gun (approx. 330 m/sec) to close to micrometeoroid debris velocities of 4800 m/sec. In this presentation, we report on a suite of polymeric materials possessing this characteristic. Figure 1 illustrates the puncture healing concept. Puncture healing in these materials is dependent upon how the combination of a polymer's viscoelastic properties responds to the energy input resulting from the puncture event. Projectile penetration increases the temperature {{in the vicinity of the}} impact. Self-healing behavior occurs following puncture, whereby energy must be transferred to the material during impact both elastically and inelastically, thus establishing two requirements for puncture healing to occur: a.) The need for the puncture event to produce a local melt state in the polymer material and b.) The molten material has to have sufficient <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> to snap back and close the hole. 1, 2 Previous ballistic testing studies revealed that Surlyn materials warmed up to a temperature approx. 98 C during projectile puncture (3 C higher than it s melting temperature). 1, 2 The temperature increase produces a localized flow state and the <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> to snap back thus sealing the hole. Table 1 lists the commercially polymers studied here, together with their physical properties. The polymers were selected based on chemical structure, tensile strengths, tensile moduli, glass transition temperature, melting temperatures, and impact strength.

However, the incorporation of a viscoelastic constitutive equation into computer models for polymer processing poses many problems, {{and for this reason}} inelastic models have been used almost exclusively to represent rheological behavior for flow simulation in the plastics industry. In order to explore the limits of viscoelastic flow simulations, we used two nonlinear viscoelastic models (Leonov and Phan-Thien/Tanner) to simulate axisymmetric and planar contraction flows and extrudate swell. Their predictions were compared with those obtained using a strictly viscous model (Carreau-Yasuda) and with experimental results. The models are implemented in a modified Elastic Viscous Split Stress (EVSS) mixed finite element formulation. The viscoelastic constitutive equations are calculated using the Lesaint-Raviart method, and the divergence-free Stokes problem is solved applying Uzawa's algorithm. The decoupled iterative scheme is used as a preconditioner for the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method. Numerical instability was observed starting at quite low elasticity levels. For the converging flows, the predicted flow patterns were in fair agreement with experimental results, but there was a large discrepancy in the entrance pressure drop. In the case of extrudate swell, the agreement with observation was poor, and convergence was impossible except at the lowest flow rate. After exploring the limits of simulations using viscoelastic models, we conclude that there are serious barriers to progress in the simulation of viscoelastic flows of industrial importance. The ultimate source of the problem is the <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity,</b> and traditional numerical methods and rheological models do not provide a suitable basis for simulating practical flows.

40|$|Like teeth, {{bone and}} sea shells, {{semicrystalline}} polymers combine strength with toughness by forming a nano-scale composite with platelet-like crystals stacked with noncrystalline material between them. The morphology and orientation {{distribution of the}} nanostructure dictate the material properties. Dynamics of polymer chains in the melt {{play an important role}} in controlling the morphology, especially under the influence of flow. Using bimodal isotactic polypropylenes to reveal the effects of small concentrations of very long chains, in collaboration with Mitsubishi Chemical, we show that long chains have a profound effect when they are so long that they can undergo chain stretching, particularly when the long chain concentration is at or above their overlap concentration. When subjected to identical stress at identical subcooling, the blends containing long chains undergo dramatically faster crystallization with very strong orientation. The “long chains" enhance formation of highly oriented crystallization precursors (“shish") on which oriented lamellae (“kebabs") subsequently grow. In collaboration with Sumitomo Chemical and The University of Tokyo, we test the hypothesis that the kebabs are actually composed of long chains using isotopic labelling of selected fractions and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). The results show that long chains in the shish are at the same concentration as they are everywhere else: there is no neutron scattering contrast when the long chains are the deuterium labelled ones! The long chains are essential for the formation of shish and they play their role by “recruiting" adjacent chains into formation of the shish. Placing molecular defects on the longest chains inhibits their ability to serve this role, providing a molecular tool to independently control the <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> (by choice of the length and concentration of the long chains) and the flow-induced crystallization behavior (by selecting the comonomer content, for example, of the long chains) ...|$|E
40|$|NoThis report covers {{experimental}} studies and numerical modelling of interfacial {{instability in the}} bi-layer coextrusion flow of two low-density polyethylene melts. Melt streams are converged at an angle of 30 ° to a common die land. Melt stream confluence was observed in two coextrusion die arrangements. In one die design, which we term ‘bifurcated’ the melt stream is split by a divider plate in the die after being delivered from a single extruder. In the other design melt streams are delivered to a die from two separate extruders. In each die design melt flow in the confluent region and die land to the die exit was observed through side windows of a visualization cell. Velocity ratios of the two melt streams were varied and layer thickness ratios producing wave type interfacial instability determined for each melt {{for a variety of}} flow conditions. Stress and velocity fields in the coextrusion arrangements were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. Wave type interfacial instability occurred in the processing of the low-density polyethylene melts at specific, repeatable, stream layer ratios. The birefringent pattern in the confluence region {{and the beginning of the}} die land appeared stable even when the extrudate exhibited instability. However, disturbances were observed in the flow field near the exit of the die land.

40|$|The {{injection}} molding process, {{due to its}} versatility, cost effectiveness, and ability to produce precise complex articles is widely used in plastics processing. Mold cavity pressure is a good indicator of the processes {{taking place in the}} cavity and {{plays an important role in}} determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic modeling and control of cavity pressure, based on a physically-based approach, is studied in this research project. The work deals with the filling and packing phases. A lumped physically-based model was developed in order to study the behavior of the system. The model is derived from conservation laws and incorporates a physical understanding of the process. The whole system was divided into subsystems including the hydraulic system, ram-screw, barrel, and polymer delivery system. It was found necessary to account for polymer <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> as well as non-Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt flow. Consideration of the growing solid skin in the polymer delivery system was found to be necessary. The dynamics of the cavity pressure during the filling phase were investigated and found to be non-linear and time-varying in relation to the hydraulic servo-valve opening which is the manipulated variable. The dynamic behavior of the cavity pressure is approximated by piece-wise linearization of the non-linear governing equations to derive a transfer function using the physically-based model which is of fifth order. Adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were designed and tested for the control of the cavity pressure. Various tuning techniques, along with changes in set-point, were used to determine conservative settings for the PI and PID controllers. A similar approach was used to study the dynamics of the cavity pressure during the packing phase. A sixth order transfer function, with piece-wise linearization, was derived to approximate the non-linear and time-varying behavior of the cavity pressure during packing. The adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were successfully applied into the packing phase. The transition of the filling-to-packing was selected to be detected by the derivative of the cavity pressure and adaptive controllers were successfully used for this phase. Two commonly used {{injection molding}} grade thermoplastics, polyethylene and polystyrene, were used in experimental part of this work for model validation and controller testing...|$|E
40|$|Polymer melts {{experience}} complex, time variant, {{stress and}} deformation fields on their passage through fixed geometries in many conversion operations. Flow complexity is further increased in operations involving the co-joining {{of two or}} more melt streams where one confining boundary is moving and viscoelastic. Such a complex situation arises in coextrusion processes. This work covers experimental studies on polyethylene melt flows in complex coextrusion geometries with a view to understanding the stress fields involved and their effects on flow stability. A 30 ° 1 coextrusion geometry is studied using two extrusion arrangements. In one arrangement a single extruder is used to feed a 'bifurcated' die design wherein the melt stream is split prior to, and rejoined after, a divider plate in the die. In the other design melt streams are delivered to, and converged at 30 °, using two independent extruders. In a second die melt streams are brought together at 90 °. In each die arrangement melt flow in the confluent region and die land to the die exit was observed through side windows of a visualisation cell. Velocity ratios of the two melt streams were varied and layer thickness ratios producing instability are determined for each melt for a variety of flow conditions. Stress and velocity fields in the coextrusion arrangements were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. The study demonstrates conclusively that wave type interfacial instability occurred in the coextrusion geometries when the same low density polyethylene melt is used in each stream. This observation occurred at specific, repeatable, stream layer ratios in each die arrangement. The complex flows were numerical modelled using a modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 P software. There was reasonable agreement between modelled at experimentally determined stress fields. Modelling however provided far more detailed stress gradient information than could be resolved from the optical techniques. A total normal stress difference (TNSD) sign criterion was used to predict the critical layer ratio for the onset of the interfacial instability in one die arrangement and good agreement between theory and experiment has been obtained. The study conclusively demonstrates wave type interfacial instability in the coextrusion process is not caused by process perturbations potentially introduced by extruder screw rotation but is associated with process-history dependant differences in <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity.</b> © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Blends {{of natural}} rubber (NR) and {{polystyrene}} (PS) were prepared by melt mixing in a Brabender plasticorder and by solution casting using chloroform as the casting solvent. Earlier {{studies have indicated}} that these blends are incompatible and immiscible, and their compatibility can be improved by the addition of a graft copolymer of NR and PS (NR-g-PS). The rheological behavior of these blends has been carried out in the presence and absence of the compatibilizer using a capillary rheometer and a melt flow indexer. The effects of blend ratio, processing techniques (melt mixing versus solution casting), shear stress, and temperature on the rheological behavior have been studied in detail. Both in the presence and absence of the copolymer, the blends showed a decrease in viscosity with an increase of shear stress, indicating pseudoplastic nature. Solution-cast blends showed a higher viscosity as compared to melt-mixed blends. The viscosity versus composition curve of both melt-mixed and solution-cast blends showed negative deviation from the additivity at a higher shear rate region. This is associated with the interlayer slip between the highly incompatible NR and PS phases. The effects of graft copolymer loading and temperature on solution-cast blends were studied, and it was found that as the copolymer loading increases, the shear viscosity increases. This is due to the high interfacial interaction between the two components {{in the presence of the}} copolymer. The copolymer, in fact, locates at the interface and makes the interface more broad. However, at higher loading of the copolymer, the viscosity of the blends decreases. This may be associated with the formation of micelles, which have a plasticizing action on the viscosity of the blends. <b>Melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> parameters like principal normal stress difference, recoverable elastic shear strain, and die swell were evaluated. Master curves have been generated using modified viscosity and shear rate functions that contain the melt flow index as a parameter. The extrudate morphology of the blends was studied using a scanning electron microscope. Addition of the copolymer reduces the domain size of the dispersed phase, followed by a leveling off at a higher concentration. The leveling off is an indication of interfacial saturation. The interparticle distance also decreased followed by a leveling off at a higher loading of the copolymer. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used manufacturing methods for the production of polymer-based components such as car bumpers and other automotive details. The surface appearance of these products is of great importance since it is directly connected to the perceived quality. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can exhibit a number of surface defects which lower their quality impression. To a large extent, this work deals with characterisation of flow-induced surface defects called tiger stripes or flow marks. They consist in alternating glossy and dull bands which appear on the surface of injection-moulded polymers, especially when long flow lengths are involved. The flow marks are approximately perpendicular to the flow direction and they are often opposite in phase on the two sides of the moulded object. The materials typically used for injection moulding of car components, and studied in the present work, are elastomer-modified polypropylene grades containing fillers. Two main theories behind the formation of the flow marks are discussed here: a slip-stick phenomenon and a snake-like flow which can initiate an unstable flow front during the filling of the mould. Several techniques were used in order to characterise the banded regions. Stereographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as gloss evaluation, revealed that the dull regions were rougher and less glossy than the other type of bands. SEM micrographs of the cross section of the stripes indicated differences in the filler distribution between the different bands; the dull bands seemed to contain a lower amount of filler in the proximity of their surface. A course of events leading to this difference is suggested. Rheological studies of the polymer melts suggested that a higher <b>melt</b> <b>elasticity</b> is beneficial since it reduces the propensity for the defects generation. The effect of ageing on the severity of the flow marks is discussed in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness and thermal stability. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer is another engineering polymer widely used to produce vehicle interior components as well as domestic appliances, toys, etc. ABS is known to be sensitive towards ageing especially when exposed to UV-light. The effect of ageing on the appearance of injection-moulded ABS samples was studied here, in particular colour changes were evaluated. Natural coloured and grey coloured ABS specimens, containing the same type and the same amount of stabilisers, were exposed to a heat ageing treatment and to artificial weathering. In general, the natural coloured ABS suffered the most severe discolouration and the artificial weathering produced the strongest effect. Interestingly, an imposed surface texture appeared to affect the colour change induced by ageing. Chemical and mechanical changes on the surface layers of the investigated samples were reported...|$|E
