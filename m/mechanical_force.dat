5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E

25|$|In {{a dynamic}} sense, the {{response}} of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body {{to respond to a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect {{is understood as}} the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The {{piezoelectric effect}} is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied <b>mechanical</b> <b>force)</b> also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E

500|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{in understanding the}} flow of blood through the heart and body came with the publication of De Motu Cordis (1628) by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey's book completely describes the systemic circulation and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> of the heart, leading to an overhaul of the Galenic doctrines. Otto Frank (1865–1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this important heart relationship. Ernest Starling (1866–1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied the heart. Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name [...] "Frank–Starling mechanism".|$|E
500|$|TBI {{is one of}} two subsets of {{acquired}} {{brain injury}} (brain damage that occur after birth); the other subset is non-traumatic brain injury, which does not involve external <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> (examples include stroke and infection). All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries, but the latter term may also refer to injury {{to other parts of the}} head. However, the terms head injury and brain injury are often used interchangeably. Similarly, brain injuries fall under the classification of central nervous system injuries and neurotrauma.

500|$|There are {{two other}} power {{conjugate}} systems on the same variables that are in use. [...] The mobility analogy maps <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> to electric current instead of voltage. [...] This analogy is widely used by mechanical filter designers and frequently in audio electronics also. [...] The mapping {{has the advantage of}} preserving network topologies across domains but does not maintain the mapping of impedances. [...] The Trent analogy classes the power conjugate variables as either across variables, or through variables depending on whether they act across an element of a system or through it. [...] This largely ends up the same as the mobility analogy except {{in the case of the}} fluid flow domain (including the acoustics domain). [...] Here pressure is made analogous to voltage (as in the impedance analogy) instead of current (as in the mobility analogy). [...] However, force in the mechanical domain is analogous to current because force acts through an object.|$|E
40|$|Since Current Injection {{transformer}} (CIT) {{systems are}} within the major group of the standard type test equipments in electrical industry, their performances are very important.

500|$|Here, permittance is Heaviside's {{term for}} capacitance. [...] He {{did not like}} any term that {{suggested}} that a capacitor was a container for holding charge. [...] He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference {{was a result of}} Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. [...] In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the electromotive force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>force.</b> [...] At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate of change is equal to the current. [...] The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. [...] The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates. [...] This is replaced with the concept of divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.|$|E
500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E
