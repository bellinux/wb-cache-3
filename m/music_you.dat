5|$|Do {{you know}} how to write a song? Do you know {{anything}} about writing? If you're going to write for records, it goes like this: A, B, C, B, C, C. I don't know what you're doing. You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll <b>music...</b> <b>You</b> should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into <b>music.</b> <b>You</b> have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is <b>music.</b> <b>You</b> can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with music historian Peter Guralnick, Charles further elaborated on his understanding, stating [...] "You take country <b>music,</b> <b>you</b> take black <b>music,</b> <b>you</b> got the same goddamn thing exactly." [...] While Modern Sounds features mostly covers of country and western music standards, its sound and musical style are marked by the heavy rhythm and blues influence of Charles's playing. A considerable amount of the material's melancholy lyrics and words are backed by piano and orchestral arrangements that are rooted in jazz, as well as West Coast and Charles's style of piano blues. Charles {{has said that the}} country album was [...] "completely different from rhythm and blues".|$|E
500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time you listen {{to one of our}} songs and that's something we really want for our <b>music.</b> <b>You</b> have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything you can expect from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E
500|$|Andy Battaglia {{compared}} {{the feeling of}} the music to the online virtual world Second Life, the city-building game SimCity, and the work of experimental filmmaker Ryan Trecartin. Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of <b>music</b> <b>you</b> never knew you knew existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click, and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} {{his place in}} modern <b>music</b> <b>you</b> probably have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside {{what remained of the}} psychedelic 1960s. Given that the Clash and Sex Pistols had made brutal social commentary obligatory, there seemed little room for any of the creative exotica that had defined the Love Decade - until, slowly but surely, singing about dead-end lives and dole queues began to pall, and {{at least some of the}} previous generation were rehabilitated. Barrett was the best example: having crashed out of Pink Floyd before the advent of indulgent [...] "progressive" [...] rock, and succumbed to a fate that appealed to the punk generation's nihilism, he underwent a revival." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pam came up {{with the}} title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we {{immediately}} became inspired and began working on the <b>music.</b> <b>You</b> know, when we hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|Graveyard Mountain Home was {{generally}} well received. Rick Anderson of Allmusic regarded the album as [...] "a surprisingly affecting and powerful work." [...] Writing for Sea of Tranquility, Michael Popke noted that [...] "If {{you listen to}} Graveyard Mountain Home as a stand-alone piece of <b>music...</b> <b>you</b> probably won't be overly impressed. If, however, you hear this sophisticated mix of dark, ambient post-rock and psychedelic sounds while viewing the 1955 public-domain film Age 13, you may consider multi-instrumentalist Kevin Moore a small-time genius." [...] Popke speculated that if Moore created more albums based on obscure films, [...] "he might just alter {{the face of the}} genre." [...] Martien Koolen of DPRP described Graveyard Mountain Home as [...] "a typical album for dark, wintry afternoons," [...] although conceded that [...] "it is not [...] cup of tea." ...|$|E

500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in <b>music</b> <b>you</b> create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So I thought we could do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock <b>music,</b> <b>you</b> can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
500|$|In Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the <b>Music</b> <b>You</b> Missed, Gene Sculatti {{wrote that}} [...] "The rhythm seems to {{anticipate}} hip-hop by three decades."

The documentary series The Blues, produced by Martin Scorsese, depicts the recording band for Electric Mud performing with Chuck D and members of The Roots.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have <b>music</b> <b>you</b> can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|Composer Patrick Doyle, who had {{previously}} worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, and Dead Again, was hired to produce the music for Sense and Sensibility. Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new [...] "gentle" [...] melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film's events. He explained, [...] "You had this middle-class English motif, and with the <b>music</b> <b>you</b> would have occasional outbursts of emotion." [...] Doyle explains that the score [...] "becomes a little more grown-up" [...] as the story progresses to one of [...] "maturity and an emotional catharsis." [...] The score contains romantic elements and has been described [...] by National Public Radio as a [...] "restricted compass... of emotion" [...] with [...] "instruments [...] blend together in a gentle sort of way". They also noted that {{as a reflection of}} the story, the score is a [...] "little wistful... and sentimental." ...|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger {{went on a}} {{nationwide}} tour {{after the release of}} Internationalist, performing with British band Swervedriver and fellow Brisbane band Not From There in capital cities across Australia. In 1999, the band also toured with Something for Kate and Alex Lloyd. Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating [...] "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose <b>music</b> <b>you</b> enjoy." [...] Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for [...] "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" [...] according to Beat Magazine's Neala Johnson, Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed their live shows to be much more [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] than recordings.|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple <b>music,</b> <b>you</b> know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|Cohn and Levithan's novel {{contained}} many musical references, including {{songs by}} The Cure and Green Day, as did Scafaria's screenplay, which she originally submitted {{with a mix}} CD featuring her ideas for the film's soundtrack, including songs by The Black Keys, Bloc Party, and Frou Frou. In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen. Sollett said that he [...] "got lucky" [...] with the songs {{that he was able}} to choose because, within the financiers and the studio, [...] "there was nobody in that group who knew all that much about music or the music that we had in the film". His objective when selecting the music was to find [...] "the best <b>music</b> <b>you</b> haven't heard yet", primarily from bands based in New York City. While filming in New York, he emailed songs [...] "right out of my iTunes [...] " [...] which he thought would suit particular scenes to Kerstein, who was in Los Angeles assembling the film as it was shot.|$|E
500|$|Composer John Paesano {{was brought}} on [...] "a {{couple of weeks}} in to post-production", and scored an episode every four to five days. Paesano {{estimated}} that each episode has around 25–30 minutes of music in it. In approaching the series' score, Paesano looked to DeKnight, who [...] "had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... <b>music</b> <b>you</b> could feel and not necessarily hear." [...] The result was a more minimalist score than typical [...] "superhero" [...] music, although the music starts to [...] "change color" [...] and move closer {{to that of the}} MCU when the classic red costume is introduced. Most of the score was produced electronically, though live elements, such as a cello, were used where possible. Rather than [...] "keep the drive and the energy up" [...] with drums, Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series' minimalist approach, and tied into the fact that Dardevil can hear people's heartbeats in the show. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on April 27, 2015.|$|E
