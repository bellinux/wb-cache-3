30|$|In several reports, {{osteoplasty}} {{has been}} combined with dedicated spindles, modified <b>mandrins,</b> and multiple micro-needle mesh to optimise biomechanical resistance of PMMA to multi-directional stresses (rebar concept) [10]. Studies in the proximal femur [9, 10, 12] and long bone diaphyses [10] have illustrated good analgesia and restoration of functional status, with either no secondary fractures [9, 10] or fewer than with osteoplasty alone [12], at 6 – 16 -month follow-up. Our {{study did not}} demonstrate any beneficial effect of osteoplasty augmented with K-wires, although this may reflect sample limitations, test protocol, or suboptimal composite material properties. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of biomechanical evidence and long-term follow-up to support these procedures.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Professor Kawai, I perfomed the puncture of the lung using the puncturing needle with three <b>mandrins</b> which was made by myself. First, by animal experiment, I compared the cytologic findings of the puncturing fluid and the pathologic-histologic findings of the same place and found a relation between them. Second by clinical experiment, I classified the cytologic findings of the puncturing fluid into four groups, namely, the exsudative type (Group A), the exsudative-productive type (Group B), the productive type (Group C), and the cirrhotic type (Group D). This method of cytologic classification enables us to indicate the lesion much more exactly than the roentgenologic and other clinical findings; furthermore it presents a good suggestion for the fore and after-treatment of thoracoplasty {{in the preparation of}} chemical therapeutic drugs. The fact that tuberculous bacillus can be found positive in the culture of the puncturing fluid in case it is negative in sputum, proves that this is an important supplementary diagnostic method. According to the facts above mentioned, I {{believe that there is a}} diagnostic value in the puncturing of the lung for pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R

"Wonder not so much, good friend," [...] {{said the}} Constable, patiently; [...] "it {{is the first}} blow of the lance or mace which pierces or stuns --those which follow are little felt." [...] [Footnote: Such an {{expression}} {{is said to have}} been used by <b>Mandrin,</b> the celebrated smuggler, while in the act of being broken upon the wheel. This dreadful punishment consists in the executioner, with a bar of iron, breaking the shoulder-bones, arms, thigh-bones, and legs of the criminal, taking--his alternate sides. The punishment is concluded by a blow across the breast, called the coup de grace, because it removes the sufferer from his agony. When <b>Mandrin</b> received the second blow over the left shoulder-bone, he laughed. His confessor inquired the reason of demeanour so unbecoming--his situation.

Think of the talent that our two countries produced about this time: Marlborough, Villars, <b>Mandrin,</b> Turpin, Boileau, Dryden, Swift, Addison, Molière, Racine, Jack Sheppard, and Louis Cartouche,--all famous within the same twenty years, and fighting, writing, robbing à l'envi! ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Mandrin</b> {{joined a}} gang of smugglers {{operating}} in the Cantons of Switzerland, France, and Savoy, which was then a sovereign state. They trafficked mainly in tobacco. <b>Mandrin</b> soon became head of this gang - {{a small army of}} some 300 men which he led and organised like a military regiment. They had warehouses for weapons and stolen goods in Savoy, and <b>Mandrin</b> believed himself out of the reach from the French authorities. During 1754 he organised six military-style campaigns. He and his men targeted only the most unpopular tax collectors, which gained them huge support from the local population. <b>Mandrin</b> bought goods (cloth, hides, tobacco, canvas and spices) in Switzerland, which he then resold in French towns without paying the Ferme Générale any of the tax due. The population was delighted with such bargains. Soon the French government passed laws forbidding the population to buy these smuggled goods. <b>Mandrin</b> reacted to the ban by going to Rodez and forcing Ferme Générale employees to buy his goods at gunpoint.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for which the band was unable to break through into the British market was because they sang in French. Ange {{eventually}} released an English-speaking version of its fifth album Par les fils de <b>Mandrin</b> (By the sons of <b>Mandrin),</b> which was hard to find and sold poorly, although this version has since been made available on CD. Unfortunately, after three albums, the quality of creation had started to decrease, and Par les fils de <b>Mandrin</b> was probably not a good choice to try to break into the British market. Au delà du délire, third album, could be the band's best effort and is recommended as the one to listen to as a starter, for newcomers to the Ange progressive phenomenon.|$|E
