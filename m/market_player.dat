Will is the Founder and CEO of Didi Chuxing ("DiDi", {{formerly known}} as Didi Kuaidi), China's largest comprehensive one-stop mobile transportation platform. In 2012, after 8 years at Alibaba Group's regional and Alipay's operations, at age 29 Will founded Beijing Orange Technology Co Ltd. in Zhongguancun, known as China’s Silicon Valley, and soon launched Didi Dache, a taxi-hailing app. In February 2015, the company merged with Kuaidi Dache, another key <b>market</b> <b>player</b> to become Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing).

40|$|Abstract — Since the {{liberalization}} of the Dutch electricity mar-ket in 1998, duties and interests of <b>market</b> <b>players</b> changed from minimizing overall costs to maximizing individual profits. Natu-rally, this {{has an effect on}} their behavior. After the introduction of the imbalance settlement system by the transmission system operator in 2001, deployment of control power has changed over time. This paper analyses this deployment of control power to examine the behavior of <b>market</b> <b>players.</b> From the analysis it can be concluded that costs for imbalance settlement are increasing over the years. It is getting ever more difficult for new <b>market</b> <b>players</b> that have only uncontrollable renewable generation to enter the market...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the herding {{phenomena}} in financial markets {{arising from the}} combined effect of (1) non-coordinated collective interactions between the <b>market</b> <b>players</b> and (2) concurrent reactions of <b>market</b> <b>players</b> to dynamic <b>market</b> signals. By interpreting the expected rate of return of an asset and the favorability on that asset as position and velocity in phase space, we construct an agent-based particle model for herding behavior in finance. We then define two types of herding functionals using this model, and show that they satisfy a Gronwall type estimate and a LaSalle type invariance property respectively, leading to the herding behavior of the <b>market</b> <b>players.</b> Various numerical tests are presented to numerically verify these results.

Ancillary services (AS) represent a good negotiation opportunity that must be considered by <b>market</b> <b>players.</b> Based on the ancillary services forecasting, market participants can use strategic bidding for day-ahead ancillary services markets. For this reason, ancillary services market simulation is being included in MASCEM, a multi-agent based electricity market simulator {{that can be used}} by <b>market</b> <b>players</b> to test and enhance their bidding strategies. The paper presents the methodology used to undertake ancillary services forecasting, based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. ANNs are used to day-ahead prediction of non-spinning reserve (NS), regulation-up (RU), and regulation down (RD). Spinning reserve (SR) is mentioned as past work for comparative analysis. A case study based on California ISO (CAISO) data is included; the forecasted results are presented and compared with CAISO published forecast...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{markets are}} complex environments, {{involving}} {{a large number}} of different entities, playing in a dynamic scene to obtain the best advantages and profits. MASCEM is a multi-agent electricity market simulator to model <b>market</b> <b>players</b> and simulate their operation in the <b>market.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>players</b> are entities with specific characteristics and objectives, making their decisions and interacting with other players. MASCEM is integrated with ALBidS, a system that provides several dynamic strategies for agents’ behavior. This paper presents a method that aims at enhancing ALBidS competence in endowing <b>market</b> <b>players</b> with adequate strategic bidding capabilities, allowing them to obtain the higher possible gains out of the market. This method uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn from experience how to choose the best from a set of possible actions. These actions are defined accordingly to the most probable points of bidding success. With the purpose of accelerating the convergence process, a simulated annealing based algorithm is included...|$|R

This paper presents a method that aims to provide <b>market</b> <b>players</b> strategic bidding capabilities, allowing them to obtain the higher possible gains out of the market. This method uses an auxiliary forecasting tool, e. g. an Artificial Neural Net-work, to predict the electricity market prices, and analyses its forecasting error patterns. Through the recognition of such patterns occurrence, the method predicts the expected error for the next forecast, and uses it to adapt the actual forecast. The goal is to approximate the forecast to the real value, reducing the forecasting error...|$|R
