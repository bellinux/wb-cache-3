5|$|CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload {{written in}} JavaScript {{as part of}} an email attachment, which {{downloads}} executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the <b>malware</b> creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the <b>malware</b> also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs spyware that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets.|$|E
5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton removed most {{traces of}} 40 {{percent of the}} <b>malware.</b> On a similar test, {{specifically}} using commercial keyloggers, Norton was able to remove most of the keyloggers, beating other tested products. Norton blocked all attempts to install <b>malware</b> on a clean system. Modifications made to the samples did not fool Norton. Norton {{was not able to}} block the installation of all the commercial keyloggers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Malware</b> {{blocking}} {{and removal}} garnered good results in PC Magazine testing. All but one <b>malware</b> samples contained within a folder were removed once the folder was opened. The last one was removed when executed. Modifications {{made to the}} samples did not affect detection. On a similar test, specifically using commercial keyloggers, Norton did not successfully detect all. In removing threats, Norton almost completely removed 40 percent of the <b>malware</b> samples and related executables. Norton was also able to remove more commercial keyloggers than any other product.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of <b>malware,</b> {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the <b>malware</b> (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{completely}} detected {{most of the}} <b>malware</b> samples. For {{two-thirds of}} the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A full scan took nearly an hour to complete though, {{twice as long as}} the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the <b>malware</b> from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware-associated files and Registry entries.|$|E
5|$|On January 23, 2012, it was {{reported}} that Twitter would be acquiring Dasient, a startup that offers <b>malware</b> protection for businesses. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website.|$|E
5|$|BitLocker is {{a logical}} volume {{encryption}} system. (A volume spans part of a hard disk drive, the whole drive or more than one drive.) When enabled, TPM and BitLocker can ensure {{the integrity of the}} trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS and boot sector), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector <b>malware.</b>|$|E
5|$|MSE {{is built}} upon the same {{foundation}} as other Microsoft security products; all {{use the same}} virus definitions and anti-malware engine, known as Microsoft <b>Malware</b> Protection Engine (MSMPENG). It {{does not have the}} personal firewall of OneCare or the centralized management features of Forefront Endpoint Protection.|$|E
5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input {{on how to deal}} with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected <b>malware.</b> As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered <b>malware</b> threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (<b>malware),</b> including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as <b>malware.</b> The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all <b>malware</b> samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all <b>malware</b> and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the Best Free Software {{award from}} PC Advisor. In December the same year, it secured the Bronze award from AV-Comparatives for {{proactive}} detection of 55percent of new or unknown <b>malware,</b> the Silver award for low false-positives (six occurrences) and the Bronze award for overall performance.|$|E
5|$|The SecuROM {{software}} {{also caused}} some virus scanners and <b>malware</b> detector {{to believe the}} software was malicious. 2K Games assured players that the software installation process did not install any malicious code or rootkit However, players observed {{that some of the}} SecuROM software was not fully removed on uninstallation of the game.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{year after}} the initial release, Microsoft quietly {{released}} the second version. It entered the technical preview stage on 19 July 2010, and the final build was released on 16 December 2010. It includes Network Inspection System (NIS), a network intrusion detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs heuristics in <b>malware</b> detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.|$|E
5|$|CryptoLocker was {{isolated}} by {{the seizure of}} the Gameover ZeuS botnet as part of Operation Tovar, as officially announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on 2 June 2014. The Department of Justice also publicly issued an indictment against the Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev for his alleged involvement in the botnet. It was estimated that at least US$3 million was extorted with the <b>malware</b> before the shutdown.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security, {{developed}} by Symantec Corporation, {{is a computer}} program that provides <b>malware</b> prevention and removal during a subscription period and uses signatures and heuristics to identify viruses. Other features included in the product are a personal firewall, email spam filtering, and phishing protection. With {{the release of the}} 2015 line in summer 2014, Symantec officially retired Norton Internet Security after fourteen years as the chief Norton product. It is superseded by Norton Security, a rechristened adaptation of the Norton 360 security suite.|$|E
5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} encrypting ransomware, the <b>malware</b> aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the {{master boot record}} and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the <b>malware</b> author has the needed decryption key.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The <b>malware</b> threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Trend Micro threat {{researchers}} discovered templates for variations for the United States and Canada, {{suggesting that}} its authors {{may have been}} planning to target users in North America. By August 2012, a new variant of Reveton began to spread in the United States, claiming to require the payment of a $200 fine to the FBI using a MoneyPak card. In February 2013, a Russian citizen was arrested in Dubai by Spanish authorities for his connection to a crime ring that had been using Reveton; ten other individuals were arrested on money laundering charges. In August 2014, Avast Software reported that it had found new variants of Reveton that also distribute password stealing <b>malware</b> {{as part of its}} payload.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all <b>malware</b> samples of the WildList (widespread <b>malware),</b> it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.|$|E
5|$|PC Magazine {{found that}} the {{firewall}} put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if <b>malware</b> can evade the firewall's control of network traffic. Previous versions did not identify the tests because none carried a malicious payload. Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing harm. The other attempts were unsuccessful either because the system was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped it. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed.|$|E
5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the <b>malware,</b> the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer {{in such a way as}} part of an investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Microsoft <b>Malware</b> Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The product {{received}} generally positive reviews praising its user interface, low {{resource usage}} and freeware license. It secured AV-TEST certification on October 2009, having demonstrated {{its ability to}} eliminate all widely encountered <b>malware.</b> However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE {{was the most popular}} AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to impersonate it.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for <b>malware,</b> this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced <b>malware</b> uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All <b>malware</b> was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
25|$|In {{its earlier}} years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence {{of the types}} of <b>malware</b> and spyware that have {{affected}} Microsoft Windows users. macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows, but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to <b>malware.</b> Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks. In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in <b>malware</b> attacks, and <b>malware</b> such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the <b>malware</b> installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input. Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the <b>malware</b> or admit the existence of the <b>malware</b> issue, but as the <b>malware</b> spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected. Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly.|$|E
25|$|Substantially, when a <b>malware</b> {{arrives in}} the hands of an {{antivirus}} firm, it is analysed by <b>malware</b> researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a <b>malware,</b> a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.|$|E
25|$|Research from {{security}} company Trend Micro lists premium service {{abuse as}} {{the most common type}} of Android <b>malware,</b> where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other <b>malware</b> displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties. Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the <b>malware</b> and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons, and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users. Google maintains that dangerous <b>malware</b> is actually extremely rare, and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android <b>malware</b> reported had come from the Google Play store.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, AV-TEST {{reported}} {{a number of}} 5,490,960 new unique <b>malware</b> samples (based on MD5) only for that year. In 2012 and 2013, antivirus firms {{reported a}} new <b>malware</b> samples range from 300,000 to over 500,000 per day.|$|E
25|$|AutoRun <b>malware</b> {{has been}} {{extended}} to use hard drives, picture frames and other digital devices. Care in dealing with external devices is a security priority. The prevalence of <b>malware</b> infection by means of AutoRun and USB flash drive was documented in a 2011 Microsoft study analyzing data from more than 600 million systems worldwide {{in the first half}} of 2011. The study found that 26 percent of all <b>malware</b> infections of Windows system were due to USB flash drives exploiting the AutoRun feature in Microsoft Windows. That finding was in line with other statistics, such as the monthly reporting of most commonly detected <b>malware</b> by antivirus company ESET, which lists abuse of autorun.inf as first among the top ten threats in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Skin {{gambling}} {{sites have}} attracted {{a number of}} malicious users. When roulette-like websites were created, browser extensions claiming to automatically bet for the user were actually <b>malware</b> designed to steal skins and coins. The site which the <b>malware</b> was targeted at was called CSGODouble.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 2014, Staples {{reported}} that criminals had deployed <b>malware</b> to point-of-sale systems at 115 of their retail {{stores in the}} United States. At 113 stores, the <b>malware</b> may have allowed access to this data for purchases made from August 10, 2014 through September 16, 2014. At two stores, the <b>malware</b> may have allowed access to data from purchases made from July 20, 2014 through September 16, 2014. Overall, the company believed that approximately 1.16 million payment cards may have been affected.|$|E
25|$|Two {{websites}} in Denmark and Malaysia were configured as {{command and}} control servers for the <b>malware,</b> allowing it to be updated, and for industrial espionage to be conducted by uploading information. Both of these websites have subsequently been taken down {{as part of a}} global effort to disable the <b>malware.</b>|$|E
