5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The <b>Municipal</b> <b>Committee</b> for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Municipal</b> {{oversight}} <b>committees</b> are trajectories {{for effective}} {{performance of the}} contemporary municipalities. This research evaluates structural measures and competencies critical for effective performance of the <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees.</b> A conceptual analysis as a qualitative research technique was used to critically analyse theories on the predictors for effective performance of the <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees.</b> Theoretical findings were triangulated {{with the findings of}} the studies conducted on the effectiveness of the <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees</b> in South Africa. Findings indicated the effectiveness of <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees</b> is determined by {{the extent to which the}} existing relevant legislations and policies create structures and working relationships that permit greater level of accountability, participation and transparency. However, practices in most of the municipalities signify effective accountability, participation and transparency are undermined by the exclusionary interpretation of section 20 (3) of the Municipal Systems Act by the <b>municipal</b> executive mayoral <b>committees.</b> Such exclusionary interpretations cause the exclusion of the municipal councils and Section 79 committees from certain meetings and information. Since councilors are directly elected from the larger society irrespective of the level of education and expertise, the other challenges were also found to be latent in the skills and competencies of councilors to effectively accomplish technically complex activities of the <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees.</b> The study concludes with the postulation of a grid of critical structural measures and competencies that can be suggested for improving the performance of councilors and <b>municipal</b> oversight <b>committees...</b>|$|R
