2500|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> up, {{apparently}} recovering his serenity. [...] He {{was full}} of punch. [...] He washed, shaved and got dressed. [...] Then he strode out of his bedroom, flung {{open the door to}} the chancellery, and announced in a loud voice: [...] "From now on I'm giving everyone visas. [...] There will be no more nationalities, races or religions." [...] Then our father told us that he had heard a voice, that of his conscience or of God, which dictated to him what course of action he should take, and that everything was clear in his mind.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> up {{from the}} corner where he sat, and stood beside the man.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Nat Poole talking. I am {{up here in}} Clayton--in the First National Bank. You know <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> me a {{job here}} last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah, {{you make}} me tired, Phil Lawrence!" [...] growled the prisoner. [...] "I don't think you'll {{be able to send}} me to prison; not for long, anyhow! <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> <b>got</b> plenty of money; he'll get me out some way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here, I {{tell you}} what! You had better call at our house, {{if you are}} going that way. Twenty-four, Mews Street, Grosvenor Square. <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> <b>got</b> a slight touch of the gout, and is kept at home by it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{everything}} all planned. I'm going into law with <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I've <b>got</b> {{plans for a}} house, and we'll begin life together today----" ...|$|R
60|$|Page. Sure {{you think}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> me of some Dutchwoman, and that I am {{but of a}} half-strain courage; but you shall find that I am all over English as well in fire as water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it, Jessie. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> {{a letter}} from Tad Rason, an old hunter and guide {{who lives in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mirror Lake. He says that that place has been known as Bear Camp for years. He told about shooting a big black bear there only a year or so ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are Brazilian stones," [...] he explained, with a boyish {{pleasure}} that awoke memories {{and held her}} speechless. [...] "I believe it's very difficult, if not impossible, to buy them now. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> them {{after the war and}} I had them remounted." [...] And he pressed them against the pink lobes of her ears. [...] "You look like the Queen of Sheba." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{then with}} a fresh {{realization}} of painful difficulties ahead: [...] "I have to tell this to <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I've <b>got</b> to explain---- And he thought--he expected----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{would have}} <b>got</b> here alive with these things," [...] said young Mavering. [...] "Did {{you see how}} I came to his rescue?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{and mother}} <b>got</b> wit, And my bold brethren three, O mickle wad be the gude red blude, This day wad be spilt for me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone, yes, thank goodness," [...] replied Jane. [...] "Now I'll {{have peace}} for a while. Lassiter, I {{want you to}} see my horses. You are a rider, and you must be a judge of horseflesh. Some of mine have Arabian blood. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> his best strain in Nevada from Indians who claimed their horses were bred down from the {{original}} stock left by the Spaniards." ...|$|E
60|$|Happy and {{contented}} indeed! Didn't I {{know how}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> {{on with his}} 300L. a year, {{and how it was}} all he could do out of it to add a hundred a year to my narrow income, and live himself! My mind was made up. I instantly mounted the coach and flew to our village,--to Mr. Crutty's, of course. It was next door to Doctor Bates's; but I had no business THERE.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; when I {{was quite}} a little girl, and he had only just joined. He found me out before our {{quarters}} at Gibraltar trying to draw an old Spaniard selling oranges, and he helped me, and {{showed me how to}} hold my pencil. I have got it still---the sketch. Then he used to lend me things to copy, and give me hints till---oh, till my father said I was too old for that sort of thing! Then, you know, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> his commission, and I went to school at Belfast.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Grandfather Frog chuckled. [...] "I <b>got</b> it from <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and he <b>got</b> his {{from his}} father, and so on, {{way back to}} the days when the world was young and the Frogs ruled the world," [...] said he. [...] "Would you like to hear about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!'--with {{a gesture}} of disgust. 'She went out when I was born. <b>My</b> <b>father,</b> he <b>got</b> these papers from the Jadoo-Gher {{what do you call}} that?' (Bennett nodded) 'because he was in good-standing. What do you call that?' (again Bennett nodded). 'My father told me that. He said, too, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two days ago, he said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and that the Bull shall help me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah, don't talk to me! Didn't I {{tell you}} I don't want any preaching? If I've {{got to go}} to jail I'll go, but it won't be for long, mark <b>my</b> words! <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has <b>got</b> lots of money, and I guess the lawyers will know what to do. But let me tell you something, Dave Porter"--and now Link Merwell's face showed both cunning and hatred--"you found fault with that note I sent to you calling you a poorhouse nobody. Well, that is all you are; a poorhouse nobody!" ...|$|R
6000|$|GREGORY [interrupting her]. Yes, Yes: I {{know all}} about that. It's not romantic: it's not Don Juan: it's not advanced; but we feel it all the same. It's far deeper in our blood and bones than all the romantic stuff. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> into a scandal once: that was why my mother made me promise never {{to make love to}} a married woman. And now I've done it I can't feel honest. Don't pretend to despise me or laugh at me. You feel it too. You said just now that your own {{conscience}} was uneasy when you thought of your husband. What must it be when you think of my wife? ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{likely the}} reading of Ossian had {{something}} to do with my morbid anxieties. I had read Byron's imitation of him before that, and admired it prodigiously, and when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> me the book--as usual I did not know where or how he got it--not all the tall forms that moved before the eyes of haunted bards in the dusky vale of autumn could have kept me from it. There were certain outline illustrations in it, which were very good in the cold Flaxman manner, and helped largely to heighten the fascination of the poems for me. They did not supplant the pastorals of Pope in my affections, and they were never the grand passion with me that Pope's poems had been.|$|E
60|$|We {{children}} who were used to the free range of woods and fields were homesick for the country in our narrow city yard, and I associate with this longing the 'Farmer's Boy of Bloomfield,' which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> for me. It was a little book in blue cloth, {{and there were some}} mild woodcuts in it. I read it with a tempered pleasure, and with a vague resentment of its trespass upon Thomson's ground in the division of its parts under the names of the seasons. I do not know why I need have felt this. I was not yet very fond of Thomson. I really liked Bloomfield better; for one thing, his poem was written in the heroic decasyllabics which I preferred to any other verse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{a dragon}} and a gentleman!" [...] {{answered}} the monster, proudly, as the king paused {{for lack of}} a word; [...] "and I believe I know what's proper for dragons to do and what isn't. I've learned wisdom from <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who <b>got</b> into trouble with Saint George, and if I fought with this person who calls himself Prince Marvel, I'd deserve to be a victim of your Fool-Killer. Oh, I know my business, King Terribus; and if you knew yours, you'd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we haven't," [...] he declared, quickly. He {{seemed to}} gather {{assurance}} with his spoken thought, and conscious fear left him. [...] "Wade, you {{took advantage of}} me that day--when you made me swear things. I've changed my mind.... And as for that deal with the rustlers, I've got my story. It's as good as yours. I've {{been waiting for you}} to tell <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> You've <b>got</b> some reason for not telling him. I've a hunch it's Collie. I'm on to you, and I've got my nerve back. You can gamble I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} penny points, {{but if they}} had been playing for five pounds they couldn't have taken it more to heart; and of course if I had the misfortune of being their partner they put it down entirely to my bad play. Well, we held good cards, and at last we only wanted the odd trick to win. I held the last trump. Mrs. O'Toole was beaming as she led the best spade, and felt that the game was won. I could not resist the temptation, but put my trump on her spade, led my small card, and the game was lost. Mrs. O'Toole gave a scream and sank back in her chair almost fainting, and when she {{recovered}} her breath and her voice went on like a maniac, and had a desperate quarrel with my aunts. I made my escape, and three days later, to my huge delight, was sent off to Dublin and entered the university. I only stayed there about six months, when a friend of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>got</b> me a commission; but that six months cured me of my shyness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Our tribe {{had always}} been used to wander about {{from place to place}} over the frozen seas, like the other tribes, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> tired of that, two years ago, and built this great mansion of frozen snow-blocks--look at it; it is seven feet high and three or four times as long as any of the others--and here we have stayed ever since. He was very proud of his house, and that was reasonable, for if you have {{examined}} it with care you must have noticed how much finer and completer it is than houses usually are. But if you have not, you must, for you will find it has luxurious appointments that are quite beyond the common. For instance, in that end of it which you have called the [...] "parlour," [...] the raised platform for the accommodation of guests and the family at meals is the largest you have ever seen in any house--is it not so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{one point}} I must {{acknowledge}} {{that you have}} proved yourself {{a master of the}} art of fiction. What Hetty and I said to one another that day when she came upon me in the shrubbery at Alton College was known only to us two. She never told it to anyone, and I soon forgot it. All due honor, therefore, to the ingenuity with which you have filled the hiatus, and shown the state of affairs between us by a discourse on [...] "surplus value," [...] cribbed from an imperfect report of one of my public lectures, and from the pages of Karl Marx! If you were an economist I should condemn you for confusing economic with ethical considerations, and for your uncertainty as to the function which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> his start by performing. But as you are only a novelist, I compliment you heartily on your clever little pasticcio, adding, however, that as an account of what actually passed between myself and Hetty, it is the wildest romance ever penned. Wickens's boy was far nearer the mark.|$|E
60|$|When James was {{fighting}} in the field, according to his own account, I had the honour of dining with the electors {{who voted for the}} Captain, him paying all expenses. It was a lucky accident my mother sending me to the town-house, where the dinner came off, to try to get my father home at a decent hour, me having a remarkable power over him when in liquor but at no other time. They were very jolly, however, and insisted on my drinking the Captain's health and eating more than was safe. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> it next day from my mother for this; and so would I myself, but it was several days before I left my bed, completely knocked up as I was with the excitement and one thing or another. The bonfire, which was built to celebrate the election of Mr. Scrimgour, was set ablaze, though I did not see it, in honour of the election of the Captain; it being thought a pity to lose it, as no doubt it would have been. That is about all I remember of the celebrated election of '32 when the Reform Bill was passed.|$|E
60|$|ASHER. On {{account of}} his health. He was {{delicate}} as a boy. He must have been about {{eight or nine years}} old when Uncle Henry left Foxon Falls for the west,--that was before you were born. Uncle Henry died somewhere in Iowa. He and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> never <b>got</b> along. Uncle Henry had as much as your grandfather to begin with, and let it slip through his fingers. He managed to send Jonathan to a medical school, and it seems that he's had some sort of a position at Johns Hopkins's--research work. I don't know what he's got to live on.|$|R
6000|$|... "None of it," [...] replied her cousin. [...] "Every month, every day, {{should have}} its purpose. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has <b>got</b> into a dull, heartless, apathetic mode of life, which suits {{my mother and}} Selina, but which will never suit you. Grey Abbey is like the Dead Sea, of which the waters are always bitter as well as stagnant. It makes me miserable, dearest Fanny, to see you stifled in such a pool. Your beauty, talents, and energies--your {{disposition}} to enjoy life, and power of making it enjoyable for others, are all thrown away. Oh, Fanny, if I could rescue you from this!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Just one {{fragment}} {{of a letter}} written by Mathinna reveals what the transition from living with her family at Flinders Island to living at Government House must have been like: [...] "I am good little girl, Ihave pen and ink cause I am a good little girl [...] [...] [...] [...] I have a got a red frock like <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> Come here to see <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I have <b>got</b> sore feet and shoes and stockings and I am very glad." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the prince}} lay at Worcester {{he made an}} {{incursion}} into Herefordshire, and having made some of the gentlemen prisoners, brought them to Worcester; and though it was an action which had not been usual, they being persons not in arms, yet the like being my father's case, who was really not in commission, nor in any military service, having resigned his regiment three years before to me, the prince insisted on exchanging them for such as the Parliament had in custody in like circumstances. The gentlemen seeing no remedy, solicited their own case at the Parliament, and got it passed in their behalf; and by this means <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> his liberty, and by {{the assistance of the}} Earl of Denbigh got leave to come to London to make a composition as a delinquent for his estate. This they charged at £7000, but by the assistance of the same noble person he got off for £4000. Some members of the committee moved very kindly that my father should oblige me to quit the king's service, but that, as a thing which might be out of his power, was not insisted on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should do}} so, {{you may be}} quite sure, Millicent, if I {{consulted}} my own inclinations, but I am bearing out your father's wishes. This bracelet is the most valuable {{of all the things}} he had, and I believe that it has some sort of history attached to it. He told my father that he had sent all the gems home principally to get these diamonds out of his possession; he said that as soon as <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> hold of the things, he was to take the diamonds straight over to Amsterdam and sell them there, for he considered that they were much too valuable to be kept in the house, and that it was possible that some of the Hindoos might endeavor to get possession of them. At the time he spoke he believed that my father would, at his death, go to the bank and get the jewels, as of course he would have done if he had known where to find them. My father promised him that they should be taken to Amsterdam at once; and although so many years have passed since his death, I think I am bound to carry out that promise." ...|$|E
60|$|A garden, {{even when}} it is not exasperated by {{intensive}} methods, is a thing as exacting as a baby, its moods have to be watched; it does not wait upon the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its own. Intensive culture greatly increases this disposition to trouble mankind; it makes a garden touchy and hysterical, a drugged and demoralised and over-irritated garden. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>got</b> at cross purposes with our two patches at an early stage. Everything grew wrong from the first to last, and if my father's manures intensified nothing else, they certainly intensified the Primordial Curse. The peas were eaten in the night before they were three inches high, the beans bore nothing but blight, the only apparent result of a spraying of the potatoes was to develop a PENCHANT in the cat for being ill indoors, the cucumber frames were damaged by the catapulting of boys going down the lane at the back, and all your cucumbers were mysteriously embittered. That lane with its occasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme, because my father always stopped work and went indoors if any one watched him. His special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome spirit of inquiry in hardy natures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait! Don't go! Oh, hear a last word!... May a {{more just}} and merciful God than the God I {{was taught to}} worship judge me--forgive me--save me! For I can no longer keep silent!... Lassiter, in {{pleading}} for Dyer I've been pleading more for <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was a Mormon master, close to {{the leaders of the}} church. It was <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who sent Dyer out to proselyte. It was <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who had the blue-ice eye and the beard of gold. It was <b>my</b> <b>father</b> you <b>got</b> trace of in the past years. Truly, Dyer ruined Milly Erne--dragged her from her home--to Utah--to Cottonwoods. But it was for <b>my</b> <b>father!</b> If Milly Erne was ever wife of a Mormon that Mormon was <b>my</b> <b>father!</b> I never knew--never will know whether or not she was a wife. Blind I may be, Lassiter--fanatically faithful to a false religion I may have been but I know justice, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> is beyond human justice. Surely he is meeting just punishment--somewhere. Always it has appalled me--the thought of your killing Dyer for <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> sins. So I have prayed!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Concerning his family's {{religious}} background, Ziegler {{has stated}} that he [...] "grew up in an incredibly, very strict Roman Catholic family on both sides, my mother and <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> side. I've <b>got</b> numerous aunts who've been in the convent. I went to Catholic high school, Catholic college, as did almost all of my relatives, so, I mean, I'm very steeped in Catholicism". Ziegler is, however, an agnostic, referring to himself as a [...] "recovering Catholic".|$|R
60|$|We now had {{received}} {{orders from the}} king to join him; but I representing to the prince the condition of my regiment, which was now 100 men, and that, being within twenty-five miles of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> house, I might soon recruit it, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> having <b>got</b> some men together already, I desired leave to lie at Shrewsbury for a month, to make up my men. Accordingly, having obtained his leave, I marched to Wrexham, where in two days' time I got twenty men, and so on to Shrewsbury. I had not been here above ten days, but I received an express to come away with what recruits I had got together, Prince Rupert having positive orders to meet the king by a certain day. I had not mounted 100 men, though I had listed above 200, when these orders came; but leaving <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to complete them for me, I marched with those I had and came to Oxford.|$|R
