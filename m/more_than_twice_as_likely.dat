25|$|An April 2011 poll of 2,000 British adults {{found that}} 35% {{of the public}} {{intended}} to watch the wedding on television while an equal proportion planned to ignore the event altogether. According to their reported plans, women were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> (47%) to watch the event as men (23%). Early estimates following the ceremony indicated an estimated 24.5 {{million people in the}} United Kingdom watched the wedding on either BBC One or ITV, giving those channels a 99.4% share of the terrestrial television audience as the service began, with the BBC's Live royal wedding website having 9 million hits, estimating over half the British population watched the wedding.|$|E

25|$|Continuity of supply. The 2015 Impact Report reports {{an average}} supply of 18 hours per day, up from 14 hours in 2006-07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is {{provided}} continuously 24 hours per day. In Nairobi water is provided on average for 18 {{hours a day}} and in Mombasa for 6 hours. Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in Kisumu over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to say they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.|$|E

2500|$|A peer-reviewed {{comparison}} {{study of}} healthcare access {{in the two}} countries published in 2006 concluded that U.S. residents are one third less likely to have a regular medical doctor, one fourth more likely to have unmet healthcare needs, and are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to forgo needed medicines. The study noted that access problems [...] "were particularly dire for the US uninsured." [...] Those who lack insurance in the U.S. were much less satisfied, less likely to have seen a doctor, and {{more likely to have been}} unable to receive desired care than both Canadians and insured Americans.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2007, the American Cancer Society {{dedicated}} $15 {{million to}} a public awareness campaign on inadequate access to healthcare for the 47 million Americans not covered by insurance.

The society noted that studies had shown that patients without insurance were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have their cancer diagnosed in the late stages of the disease.

2500|$|Boys {{who caused}} a {{pregnancy}} {{in the past}} were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to become abstinent after this episode than boys who had not. However, for girls, a past pregnancy had little correlation with secondary abstinence. Fear of pregnancy, wanting to wait until marriage, {{and not wanting to}} have sex were cited more often by virgins in the 12th grade than they were by 9th graders. [...] Of the sexually experienced who are now practicing abstinence, girls were more likely than boys to say a lack of desire, fear of STDs, being afraid of getting caught, the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone their age, and that their parents had taught them the advantages of waiting as reasons why they made their decision.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} the Washington Post {{published}} {{the results of the}} investigation, the CDC published a [...] "Notice to Readers" [...] in the May 21, 2010 issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report admitting that the 2004 report was misleading. It said the original report [...] "did not reflect findings of concern from the separate longitudinal study that showed that children living in homes serviced by a lead water pipe were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as other DC children to have had a blood lead level ≥10 µg/dL." [...] A further Notice to Readers published in June 2010 clarified that the results in the 2004 report [...] "should not be used to make conclusions about the contribution of water lead to blood levels in DC, to predict what might occur in other situations where lead levels in drinking water are high, or to determine safe levels of lead in drinking water." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{impact crater}} {{on the sea}} floor would be {{evidence}} of a possible cause of the P–Tr extinction, but such a crater would by now have disappeared. As 70% of the Earth's surface is currently sea, an asteroid or comet fragment is now perhaps <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to hit ocean {{as it is to}} hit land. However, Earth has no ocean-floor crust more than 200 million years old because the [...] "conveyor belt" [...] process of seafloor spreading and subduction destroys it within that time. Craters produced by very large impacts may be masked by extensive flood basalting from below after the crust is punctured or weakened. Subduction should not, however, be entirely accepted as an explanation of why no firm evidence can be found: as with the K-T event, an ejecta blanket stratum rich in siderophilic elements (such as iridium) would be expected to be seen in formations from the time.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{studies have}} linked {{proximal}} stressors and health outcomes for African Americans. [...] For example, {{researchers have found}} that African Americans have a sense of inferiority and low self-worth due to experiences with prejudice, which are associated with emotional distress. Similarly, internalized racism has been linked to psychiatric symptoms, including high rates of alcohol consumption, low self-esteem, and depression. These findings corroborate the minority stress theory by demonstrating that proximal stressors are associated with health disparities among racial minorities. Non-Hispanic Whites are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to receive antidepressant prescription treatments as are Non-Hispanic Blacks. The death rate from suicide for African American men was almost four times that for African American women, in 2009. However, the suicide rate for African Americans is 60% lower than that of the Non-Hispanic White population. A report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that from 1980 - 1995, the suicide rate among African Americans ages 10 to 14 increased 233%, as compared to 120% of Non-Hispanic Whites.|$|E
2500|$|A {{scientific}} survey done {{found that the}} participants were more happy after watching cat videos. The researcher behind the survey explained [...] "If we want {{to better understand the}} effects the Internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can't ignore Internet cats anymore" [...] and [...] "consumption of online cat-related media deserves empirical attention". The Huffington Post suggested that the videos were a form of procrastination, with most being watched while at work or ostensibly studying, while IU Bloomington commented [...] " [...] does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers' energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings". BusinessInsider argues [...] "This falls in line with a body of research regarding the effects that animals have on people." [...] A 2015 study by Jessica Gall Myrick found that people were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to post a picture or video of a cat to the internet than they were to post a selfie. Also, it was found that people who watch cat videos feel more energetic and positive after viewing online cat content.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Iranian {{authorities}} demolished {{the shrine}} and grave site of Muhammad-Ali Barfurushi (Quddús), a Bábí leader. In late 2005, an anti-Bahá'í media campaign {{was launched in}} Iran, asserting that the religion was created by colonialist powers to subvert Islam and to subjugate the Muslim peoples of Iran. [...] In 2006 Iranian officials arrested 54 Bahá'ís, mostly young people, in Shiraz. In March and May 2008, the seven [...] "senior members" [...] who form {{the leadership of the}} Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested. Several agencies and experts and journals have published concerns about viewing the developments as a case of genocide: Roméo Dallaire, Genocide Watch, Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, the journals War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity and Journal of Genocide Research. A summary of 2013 incidents of prison sentences, fines and punishments showed that these were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to apply to Bahá'ís as any other religious minority in Iran and that the total rate of such cases had gone up by 36% over 2012.|$|E
