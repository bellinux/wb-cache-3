Three male fertile species (B. cucullata, B. subvillosa var. leptotricha and B. fischeri) and two <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> <b>hybrids</b> (B. schmidtiana x B. cucullata and B. subvillosa var. leptotricha x B. cucullata) were treated. Pollen size, which is related to pollen DNA content, increased after both N 2 O and trifluralin treatments, but the induction of large pollen was genotype dependent. Trifluralin induced large pollen only in the male fertile species, while N 2 O treatments induced fertile 2 n pollen in the <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> B. schmidtiana x B. cucullata. Cytological studies showed that trifluralin induced multinuclear monads that resulted in 4 n gametes in stead of 2 n gametes. In general, large pollen obtained after trifluralin treatments showed low germination capability, while large pollen obtained after N 2 O treatments retained high germination capability. Seedlings with raised ploidy level could only be obtained after crosses were performed with large pollen obtained from N 2 O treatments.

Characterization of genes and proteins related to male sterility aims to understand how and why the male sterility occurs, and which proteins are the key players for microspores abortion. Recently, a series of genes and proteins related to cytoplasmic male sterility, photoperiod sensitive male sterility, self-incompatibility and other types of microspores deterioration have been characterized through genetics or proteomics. Especially the latter, offers us a powerful and high throughput approach to discern the novel proteins involving in male-sterile pathways which may help us to breed artificial male-sterile system. This represents an alternative tool to meet the critical challenge of further development of hybrid rice.

40|$|The {{fertility}} of a wheat <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> line 337 S {{was investigated}} in 4 consecutive years with 18 different sowing dates. Line 337 S showed high sterility under both short daylength/low temperature and long daylength/high temperature during ear development. It has 2 time windows {{to be used as}} a <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> line for <b>hybrid</b> seed production.

40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to estimate general (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) for grain yield, oil content and oil yield of sunflower inbred lines, to estimate the portion of genetic and additive component of variance, to determine relationships between inbred lines, two-line (SC) and three-line hybrids (TWC), and to determine perspective parental lines and hybrids. Materials and Methods: Six inbred lines were used in the research, 15 experimental SC (<b>male</b> <b>sterile)</b> <b>hybrids,</b> 15 experimental TWC hybrids and 3 recognized hybrids. Obtained results were processed by analysis of variance, linear correlation analysis, Griffing’s diallel analysis, and estimation of genetic and additive variance. Results: OS- 1 line had the largestGCA effect for grain yield, oil content and oil yield. OS- 1 A x OS- 6 B combination had the highest SCA effect for grain yield, as well as for oil content and oil yield. Genetic variance was larger than environmental variance, and additive variance was larger than dominant for all traits. High significant positive correlations were found for oil content among SC and their TWChybrids. Line OS- 1 transferred its positive effects for oil content and yield in TWC hybrids. Conclusions: Line OS- 1 has desirable agronomic traits and could be used in future breeding process aimed at genetic improvement of sunflower. Additive variance was greater for all investigation traits. Lines with the best GCA for oil content kept retained? these characteristics in SC and TWC hybrids. Lines with the best GCA did not give (produce?) hybrids of the best SCA and opposite. In the case of grain and oil yield a significant correlation between SC and their TWC hybrids did not exist, although it did for oil content.

40|$|The main {{problems}} about {{research and}} application of two-line hybrid rice were reviewed, including the confusing nomenclature and <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> lines classification, the unclear characteristics of photoperiod and temperature responses and the unsuitable site selection for <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> line and <b>hybrid</b> rice seed production. In order to efficiently and accurately use dual-purpose genic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> lines, four types, including PTGMS (photo-thermo-sensitive genic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> rice), TGMS (thermo-sensitive genic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> rice), reverse PTGMS and reverse TGMS, were proposed. A new idea for explaining the mechanism of sterility in dual-purpose hybrid rice was proposed. The transition from sterile to fertile {{was involved in the}} cooperative regulation of major-effect sterile genes and photoperiod and/or temperature sensitive ones. The minor-effect genes with accumulative effect on sterility were important factors that affected the critical temperature of sterility transfer. In order to make better use of dual-purpose lines, the characterization of responses to photoperiod and temperature of PTGMS should be made and the identification method for the characterization of photoperiod and temperature responses of PTGMS should also be put forward. The optimal ecological site for seed production could be determined according to the historical climate data and the requirements for the meteorological conditions during the different periods of seed production...|$|R
40|$|In most crosses between {{closely related}} species of Drosophila, the <b>male</b> <b>hybrids</b> are <b>sterile</b> and show postmeiotic abnormalities. A series of gene {{expression}} studies using genomic approaches have found significant down regulation of postmeiotic spermatogenesis genes in <b>sterile</b> <b>male</b> <b>hybrids.</b> These results have led some to suggest a direct relationship between down regulation in gene expression and hybrid sterility. An alternative explanation to a cause-and-effect relationship between misregulation of gene expression and male sterility is rapid divergence of male sex regulatory elements leading to incompatible interactions in an interspecies hybrid genome. To test the effect of regulatory divergence in spermatogenesis gene expression, we isolated 35 fertile D. simulans strains with D. mauritiana introgressions in either the X, second or third chromosome. We analyzed gene expression in these fertile hybrid strains for a subset of spermatogenesis genes previously reported as significantly under expressed in <b>sterile</b> <b>hybrids</b> relative to D. simulans. We found that fertile autosomal introgressions can cause levels of gene down regulation {{similar to that of}} <b>sterile</b> <b>hybrids.</b> We also found that X chromosome heterospecific introgressions cause significantly less gene down regulation than autosomal introgressions.

40|$|Plants {{that are}} {{heterozygous}} for genetic markers {{but do not}} produce segregating progeny may be suspected of carrying a mutation conditioning apomixis. Seed stocks in which heterozygous plants could be identified phenotypically were treated with a chemical mutagen. These seed stocks were heterozygous for recessive genetic markers, and/or heterozygous for a chromosome translocation. Spikes from heterozygous M 1 plants were harvested and seeded in bulk. Spikes from heterozygous M 2 plants were harvested and planted in M 3 rows. The M 3 rows were observed {{for the absence of}} segregating progeny and/or were observed cytologically for the presence of a heterozygous translocation. M 3 rows not segregating for the genetic markers were crossed onto plants homozygous for the genetic markers. The F 1 progenies were observed for an expected ratio of 1 normal: 1 recessive plant. All nonsegregating lines were found to be non-heterozygous. These lines most likely occurred due to seed and pollen contamination or were the result of crossing over between genetic markers. Fertile M 2 plants were harvested from the treated heterozygous translocation seed stock. Normally, barley plants heterozygous for a translocation will produce semisterile spikes. Plants that would normally be semisterile but are fertile could be carrying a mutation conditioning apomixis. Progeny of the fertile M 2 plants were examined cytologically for the presence of the heterozygous translocation. All selected lines contained the normal seven pairs of chromosomes and were the result of seed or pollen contamination. Seed stocks which could eliminate the problem of contamination in future experiments were developed and discussed. Haploviable mutants closely linked with the <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> locus, msg 2, were isolated in these seed stocks. Haploviable mutants are recognized by upset genetic ratios of alleles linked with the mutant. Selfed progenies of plants carrying a haploviable mutation contained fertile and <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> plants in about a 1 : 1 ratio.

40|$|In Drosophila, {{crossing}} two {{closely related}} species can generate viable but <b>sterile</b> <b>male</b> offspring,typically an outcome of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Hybrids between species of the Drosophila simulans clade show disruption mainly after the meiosis stage of the spermatogenesis pathway, which eventually affects the production of mature sperm. Whole genome investigations (using microarray) of the clade identified that misregulation in <b>sterile</b> <b>hybrids</b> was caused by post-meiotic breakdown. However, either the use of non species-specific genomic platforms or the choice of tissue sampling (whole bodies rather than testes) has made the results of previous investigations prone to ambiguity. Down regulation of spermatogenesis genes specific to interspecies hybrid testes was further supported by lack of differences in gene expression in hybrid ovaries (interspecific), hybrid whole body samples (interspecific) and hybrid testes (intrapsecific) when compared to their respective parental species. However a preliminary protein assay did not suggest a difference in expression between D. mauritiana and interspecies <b>sterile</b> <b>hybrid</b> for bam and sa. These results suggest that misregulation in <b>hybrid</b> <b>sterile</b> <b>males</b> is solely transcriptional and exclusive to testes in interspecies hybrids.

The presented study established that in vitro biomass production was maximum in cytoplasmic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> genotypes (CMS) and genetic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> genotypes (GMS), GMS based F 1 -hybrid genotypes as compared to other fertility restorer/fertile genotypes of Capsicum annum L. GMS based F 1 hybrid was found to produce more biomass just like genetic <b>male</b> <b>sterile</b> genotype indicating the effect of biomass production character in CMS or GMS genotypes in the final fruit setting and fruit production in terms of yield of the plant.
