5000|$|When {{reviewing}} Huracán, Márquez {{notes that}} the book was published and received awards in Ponce, then {{the epicenter of the}} autonomist and independentist movements. The novel was also published in a time when the conflicts that eventually led to the Hispano-American War were at its height, and the author believes that its narrative was directed towards those that saw an ally in the United States, noting that in essence they were after the same imperial goals as Spain. Márquez states that the pirate's motives are portrayed in two different fronts, the local and international scenarios, with a hint of mystification labeling him as the first Puerto Rican rebel. Like Reid, the author soon notices the contrast between this etic representation of the pirate and the cutthroat stereotypes of contemporary literature. Ultimately, this version of Cofresí portrays a [...] "champion of the Puerto Rican cause" [...] that faces off against the Imperial powers of the era, with the virtue of valor being represented as fundamental beyond social classes, a symbol of Del Toro's desire to promote a collective alliance. As was the case with Tapia's Cofresí, here the death of the pirate serves to create this <b>multisectorial</b> union. Márquez concludes that both authors used their books to argue for a solution to Puerto Rico's status as a colony of Spain, but that Tapia's work inclined towards negotiating while Del Toro emphasized the need for resistance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{stems from}} an {{inductive}} research problem: the support {{given to the}} military-deep state by the youth revolutionary movement in Egypt’s political upheavals of summer 2013. Why would the youth revolutionary movement choose to support the military-deep state’s political maneuverings, {{and what is the}} precise nature of this support? To answer these questions, this paper chooses to explore two different analytical frameworks that start with different base assumptions and end with quite different interpretations. The first framework is focused on the concept of strategic choice; here, the position of the youth revolutionary movement is understood as an active decision taken in order to further the achievement of the movement’s goals. The second framework emphasizes the concept of <b>multisectorial</b> mobilization; here, the position of the youth revolutionary movement is a product of political crisis and the fleeting unification of social space. Though both frameworks suffer from shortcomings, the inclination is to support the explanation of <b>multisectorial</b> mobilization. In this sense, the position of the youth revolutionary movement {{in the face of a}} military coup is less an active choice made to further movement goals than a result of the unpredictable dynamics and associated interpretations of the crisis itself...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} A.

It argues that the logic of Young`s analysis is based on a <b>multisectorial</b> model subject to quantitative and qualitative transformations. Such a view allows us to understand 1) the emphasis, posed by the author, on propositions (that would have to be fulfilled) among different productives to ensure balanced economic expansion; 2) the attempt (made by the author in the appendix to 1928 article) to explain the economic system dynamics in presence of different intersectoral growth rates.

40|$|This {{literature}} review investigated gender differentials in HIV/AIDS in Cameroon {{and to which}} extent gender was {{taken into account in}} the country’s current policy on HIV/AIDS.

In addition, the review found that at the policy level, the government has drawn up plans to reduce the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among women. However, although the current policy acknowledged the need for tackling gender differentials in HIV/AIDS transmission; little has been done at the level of implementation. The current policy needs to be implemented in a more effective manner and a <b>multisectorial</b> approach should be explored in order to curb the current trend of the feminization of HIV/AIDS in Cameroon...|$|E
40|$|Developing countries, {{including}} South Africa, are {{lagging behind}} in reaching the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These countries are at present experiencing a nutrition transition {{that is an}} outcome of economic development, urbanisation and acculturation. In this article, the nutritional situation in South Africa based on anthropometric characteristics of its population, is briefly reviewed. The vicious cycle between poverty, undernutrition and an increased vulnerability for over-nutrition and related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is explained and hypothesised {{to be a major}} determinant of the coexistence of under-nutrition and over-nutrition in developing countries. In South Africa the coexistence of under-nutrition and over-nutrition underlies a double burden of high morbidity and mortality from both infectious and noncommunicable diseases, which is further exacerbated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. Clearly, {{it would be difficult to}} escape this intergenerational vicious circle of poverty and malnutrition, without optimising the nutritional status of all women who plan to become pregnant. There are many psychological reasons, apart from nutrition transition, why people eat more than they need to, including an inherent partiality for refined, sweet, salty and fatty foods. A conceptual framework, based on the constitutional right to food and nutrition security, is proposed to guide policy makers to plan holistic, integrated, transdisciplinary and <b>multisectorial</b> interventions to address under-nutrition and over-nutrition simultaneously. Individuals should be empowered, facilitated and motivated by appropriate education and training programmes and by strategies to improve socio-economic situations to be able to buy or produce food and to make healthy choices. This food environment will be created only if there is a common agenda, or even legislation, to improve the nutritional status in <b>multisectorial</b> and transdisciplinary programmes. The Directorate of Nutrition in the South African Department of Health has an excellent integrated nutrition strategy, but lacks the required implementation capacity. More public health nutritionists should be trained and other health professionals should be better equipped to implement nutritional interventions in all poverty alleviation and health promotion programmes. </p...|$|E
