25|$|Ray and Bill dragged {{dedication}} around Australia for 103 days last summer...they {{dragged it}} from Brisbane to Perth and {{back across the}} Nullabor to the eastern capitals {{as if it was}} their last dollar. Unfortunately they directed most of it towards avoidance of defeat during a seven-act performance which <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> naive enough to believe was staged primarily for public entertainment and which was financed by the public.|$|E
6000|$|Nobody {{made any}} further comment, but {{the eyes of}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> turned expectantly upon the clock, until at last Gordon stood up when a rattle of wheels drew nearer. [...] "This {{is going to be}} a great night, boys," [...] he said. [...] "The pernicious insect's come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{your eyes}} open and your rifle handy, Tom," [...] his uncle said. [...] "It is like enough that some young brave, anxious to {{distinguish}} himself, may crawl up {{with the intention of}} stampeding the ponies, though I don't think he would attempt it till he thought <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> asleep. Still, there is no saying." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, it is not. They {{were only}} put there temporarily. The Board Room, {{where they are}} usually kept, and {{which is in the}} main {{buildings}} of the School, happened to be needed until the next day. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> very much against leaving them in the Pavilion, but it was thought that no harm could come to them if they were removed next day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{enormous}} {{audience was}} present," [...] I explained to Zulime, [...] "and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> deeply {{interested in the}} radiant figure of that happy girl. To me she was a princess, and I observed that as the curtain rose after each act and the great tragedian came forth to bow, his eyes sought his daughter's glowing face. Each time the curtain fell his final glance was upon her. Her small hands seemed the only ones whose sound had value in his ears." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{while there}} was a lull; the subject of {{smallpox}} was taboo, and nobody heard much about it beyond vague and indefinite rumours. Indeed, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> busy {{with the question of}} the hour--the eternal question of beer, its purity and the method of its sale. For my part, I made few inquiries; like the ostrich of fable I hid my head in the sands of political excitement, hoping that the arrows of pestilence would pass us by.|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. We're not angels. I {{know a few}} scandals; but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> too dull to be {{anything}} but good.|$|R
5000|$|... "No {{one likes}} being hated: <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> afraid <b>of</b> it: it jars {{to the bone}} when we meet hatred face to face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I am so dark, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> dark here in Prague. Anton {{says that}} away in Palestine our girls are as fair {{as the girls}} in Saxony." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} meaning to deceive, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> as honourable and as ignorant as the youth themselves; {{but that does}} not acquit us of failings such as stupidity and jealousy, the two black spots in human nature which, more than love of money, are at the root of all evil. If you prefer to leave things as they are we shall {{probably}} fail you again. Do not be too sure that we have learned our lesson, and are not at this very moment doddering down some brimstone path.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to be short, the groaning chap was taken, and my man left. I was mad, {{but there}} was no time for talk, and the selfish one went off and left that poor feller to run his one chance. I had my rifle, and guessed I could hobble up to use it if need be; so we settled back to wait without much hope of help, {{everything}} being in a muddle. And wait we did till morning, for that ambulance did not come back till next day, when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> past needing it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think we}} all loved him. Even after he mismanaged {{the affairs of the}} Amity Ditch Company, we commiserated him, {{although}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> stockholders, and lost heavily. I remember that the blacksmith {{went so far as to}} say that [...] "them chaps as put that responsibility on the old man oughter be lynched." [...] But the blacksmith was not a stockholder; and the expression was looked upon as the excusable extravagance of a large, sympathizing nature, that, when combined with a powerful frame, was unworthy of notice. At least, that was the way they put it. Yet I think there was a general feeling of regret that this misfortune would interfere with the old man's long-cherished plan of [...] "going home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had two killed, {{as we came}} down," [...] he said, [...] "and {{two others}} wounded. I believe one has fallen here, and I think <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> wounded with knife thrusts." ...|$|R
60|$|Answer. Oh! dreadfully! <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> so frail {{we should}} jump in at once. But Gaspard has the knack of it. Besides {{he still has}} some of the Sheik's herb; he chews it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is slack-water, Sir Gervaise, and {{the vessels}} are looking all ways at once. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> {{clearing}} hawse, {{for there are}} more round turns in our cables, than I remember ever to have seen in so short a time." ...|$|R
60|$|However {{pressing}} our {{own private}} griefs and needs, we {{had little time}} now to dwell upon them, for the moment was at hand which was to decide for the time not only our own fates, but that of the Protestant cause in England. None of us made light of the danger. Nothing less than a miracle could preserve us from defeat, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> of opinion that {{the days of the}} miracles were past. Others, however, thought otherwise. I believe that many of our Puritans, had they seen the heavens open that night, and the armies of the Seraphim and the Cherubim descending to our aid, would have looked upon it as by no means a wonderful or unexpected occurrence.|$|E
60|$|The test was, in truth, rigorous. To ask a bashful boy or shy girl {{fresh from}} the kitchen to walk out upon a {{platform}} and face that crowd of mocking students {{was a kind of}} torture. No desk was permitted. Each victim stood bleakly exposed to the pitiless gaze of three hundred eyes, and as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> poorly dressed, in coats that never fitted and trousers that climbed our boot-tops, we suffered the miseries of the damned. The girls wore gowns which they themselves had made, and were, of course, equally self-conscious. The knowledge that their sleeves did not fit was of more concern to them than the thought of breaking down--but the fear of forgetting their lines also contributed to their dread and terror.|$|E
6000|$|Instead {{of sharing}} our {{traditional}} sentimental rhetoric with every {{man who had}} found a practical grievance, whether one care a button for the grievance or not, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> prosecuting heretics. Nationality was like religion, few could be saved, and meditation had but one theme--the perfect nation and its perfect service. [...] "Public opinion," [...] said an anonymous postcard sent {{to a friend of}} mine, [...] "will compel you to learn Irish," [...] and it certainly did compel many persons of settled habits to change tailor and cloth. I believed myself dressed according to public opinion, until a letter of apology from my tailor informed me that [...] "It takes such a long time getting Connemara cloth as it has to come all the way from Scotland." ...|$|E
50|$|Skinner {{saw that}} {{classical}} conditioning did {{not account for}} the behavior <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> interested in, such as riding a bike or writing a book. His observations led him to propose a theory about how these and similar behaviors, called operants, come about.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{sweet to}} be able to disdain, when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> glad to say, 'Thank you!' I seem I hear it. 'No, sir--I'm your better.' or 'Kiss my foot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.' And did you love him, miss?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Islam doesn't show on my face. We {{have nearly}} all, subcontinental Muslims, invented Arab {{ancestors}} for ourselves. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> sayeds, descendants <b>of</b> Mohammed through his daughter Fatima and cousin and son-in-law Ali... Everybody has got an ancestor {{who came from}} Arabia or Central Asia." ...|$|R
60|$|He sprang {{towards the}} {{sheltering}} tree with wild activity. So, indeed, did we all, but {{the rain was}} too quick for us. Down it came with the suddenness and fury of a shower-bath, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> nearly drenched before we reached our pine. There {{was a good deal}} of shouting and laughter at first, but the tremendous forces of nature that had been let loose were too overwhelming to permit of continued levity. In a few minutes the ground near our tree became seamed with little glancing rivulets, while the rain continued to descend like straight heavy rods of crystal which beat on the earth with a dull persistent roar. Ere long the saturated soil refused to drink in the superabundance, and the crystal rods, descending into innumerable pools, changed the roar into the plash of many waters.|$|E
6000|$|On the door-post of a {{house in}} Farringdon Street, {{not far from the}} Circus, stood in those days a small brass plate, announcing that the [...] "Ludgate News Rooms" [...] {{occupied}} the third and fourth floors, and that the admission to the same was one penny. We were a seedy company that every morning crowded into these rooms: clerks, shopmen, superior artisans, travellers, warehousemen--all of us out of work. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> young, but with us was mingled a sprinkling of elder men, and these latter were always the saddest and most silent of this little whispering army of the down-at-heel. Roughly speaking, we were divided into two groups: the newcomers, cheery, confident. These would flit from newspaper to newspaper with buzz of pleasant anticipation, select their advertisement as one choosing some dainty out of a rich and varied menu card, and replying to it as one conferring favour.|$|E
60|$|Commonly he did {{not keep}} things to himself, {{especially}} dislikes and condemnations. Upon most current events he had strong opinions, and he uttered them strongly. After a while he was silent in them, but if you tried him you found him in them still. He was tremendously worked up by a certain famous trial, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> {{who lived in the}} time of it. He believed the accused guilty, but when we met some months after it was over, and I tempted him to speak his mind upon it, he would only say. The man had suffered enough; as if the man had expiated his wrong, and {{he was not going to}} do anything to renew his penalty. I found that very curious, very delicate. His continued blame could not come to the sufferer's knowledge, but he felt it his duty to forbear it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> {{familiar}} {{with what we}} might call doing sustainability; learning about and managing our external (natural and constructed) environments, saving water, reducing waste, and so on – sustainability epistemology- knowledge that can be applied in/to/on the world (should we care to). In comparison, it seems much les...|$|R
60|$|The <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> {{getting so}} thin-skinned, so {{dependent}} upon steam-heat and goloshes, that {{the actions of}} a man like this riding forth upon his trail {{at all hours of the}} day and night self-sufficing and serene, seem like the doings of an epic, and so indeed they are.|$|R
60|$|God forbid that I {{should check}} an honourable ambition, {{and a desire}} to rise in life. We all ought to rise in life, and to rise far higher than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> likely to rise. But I ask you to {{consider}} very seriously what you mean by rising in life.|$|R
6000|$|Chrystal {{was a fine}} hare for {{the hounds}} who could keep up with him. He started off the first day with such a spurt that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> left behind mopping our faces, and saying, [...] "Here's a fellow," [...] which is what Mr. Stevenson says Shakespeare would have remarked about Mr. George Meredith. We never saw him again. The men who were on {{speaking}} acquaintance with his symbols revelled in him as students love an enthusiast who is eager to lead them into a world toward which they would journey. He was a rare guide for them. The bulk, however, lost him in labyrinths. They could not but admire their brilliant professor; but while their friend the medallist and he kept the conversation to themselves, they felt like eavesdroppers hearkening {{to a pair of}} lovers. It is [...] "beautiful," [...] they cried, [...] "but this is no place for us; let us away." ...|$|E
60|$|The man who {{was most}} {{affected}} by his death was the captain; but we were not prepared for the great change that soon appeared in his manner and conduct. After a time he laughed {{with the rest of}} us at a good joke, and cheered as loud as the best when a big fish turned belly up, but his behaviour to us became more gentle and kind, and he entirely gave up the habit of swearing. He also forbade working on Sunday. Many a whale have I seen sporting and spouting near us on that day, but never did we lower a boat or touch a harpoon on Sunday. Some of the men grumbled at this, and complained of it to each other, but they never spoke so as to let the captain hear, and they soon gave up their grumbling, for the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> well pleased with the change, and all of us had agreed to it.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1917 it was very hot in New York, and hotter still aboard the transatlantic liner thrust between the piers. One glance at our cabins, at the crowded decks and dining-room, at the little writing-room above, where the ink had congealed in the ink-wells, sufficed to bring home to us that the days of luxurious sea travel, of a la carte restaurants, and Louis Seize {{bedrooms}} were gone--at least for a period. The prospect of a voyage of nearly two weeks was not enticing. The ship, to be sure, was far from being the best of those still running on a line which had gained a magic reputation of immunity from submarines; three years ago she carried only second and third class passengers! But <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> in a hurry to get to the countries where war had already become a grim and terrible reality. In one way or another we had all enlisted.|$|E
5000|$|According to surfer, Mitch Crews, who {{witnessed}} Florence's {{performance at the}} 2014 Billabong Pro Teahupoo, [...] "He makes it look stupidly easily {{no matter how big}} or small the wave is. He is the man out there, rules the line up and makes everyone look silly. He is the man, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> not." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{lifebuoy}} is one {{of those}} circular lifebuoys--with which <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> familiar--which hang at the sides of steamers and other vessels, to be ready in case of any one falling overboard. It has, however, the addition of a pair of huge canvas breeches attached to it, to prevent those who are being rescued from slipping through.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} {{whatever}} that we can stand it. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> in pretty good condition still, and have some fat to spare. Fat persons can endure reduced allowance of food much better and longer {{than those who are}} lean. There's Gurney, now, for instance, he could afford to have his share even still further curtailed." ...|$|R
