2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributors}} to air, soil and water pollution is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of [...] "dry matter" [...] waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States. [...] Animal feeding operations produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> plants each year. Diffuse source pollution from agricultural fertilizers {{is more difficult to}} trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, nutrient pollution from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents. The National Research Council has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste management procedures to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{trends in}} {{phosphorus}} and phytoplankton concentrations were studied in Slapy Reserv.,as {{a representative of}} most reservoirs with medium flushing rate in the Czech Rep.

The decrease in phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations during the last decade can be interpreted as a beginning of a long-term recovery of Slapy Reservoir resulting from the decrease in P-loading into the surface waters by human population. Further possibility how to reduce phosphorus input to the surface waters is especially P removal from <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters.</b> After higher reduction of phosphorus from <b>waste</b> <b>waters,</b> accomplishable especially by the entire elimination of P from detergents and by technologies of enhanced P removal in <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment facilities,the trophic status of Slapy Reserv. lower than in the 1950 s can be expected...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previously}} enclosed material {{the current situation}} of the purification of the <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> in Serbia and Macedonia was described. Also the procedure taken with the received sludge was described too. The existing and the future legal regulations for this topic were presented and the necessary technical state of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the region was shown. The two concepts for further problem solution (about the <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters)</b> were presented, water {{that can be used}} again for irrigation. As an example for the analysis, the Community Karbinci was chosen, community which is situated in the Eastern part of Macedonia. The first concept is presented as a combination of aerobic and membranous cleaning and it is a new method which reduces the volume of the aeration tanks, place where the substances in <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> are destroyed {{and at the same time}} the space needed for their building. The second concept is a combination of anaerobic and aerobic treatment, or in other words, anaerobic reactor and pond with aeration system are planned. After the analyses were done all the advantages and the disadvantages of the two concepts were seen and the objects dimensioned and the total estimation of the investment expenses was done. From the received results it can be concluded that the two concepts meet the demands of the European Union and the purified water can be further used for irrigation and financially they are optimum decisions of this case. Serbia and Macedonia are countries which expect to become members of the EU in the following period, and they will have to meet the standards for the cleaning of the <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> and the protection of the environment.

30|$|Water dissolves {{minerals}} {{present in}} soil and rock portions during its flow, which deteriorates groundwater quality by natural processes of geogenic origin. In the Merdja area, local population largely depends on water from shallow aquifer. Agricultural activity and untreated domestic wastewaters cause a degradation of {{a quality of}} groundwater (Rouabhia et al. 2008). Contaminants can easily reach the groundwater through soils and are rapidly transported over large distances (Vu Thi Minh et al. 2006; Masoud Eid Al-Ahmadi 2013). On the other hand, because of the recent globalization, a number of industries are coming up to establish their activities in the country. As most of the industries are not adhering to the strict environmental norms, the industrial activities can overtake the impacts of agricultural practices and <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> on groundwater quality, leading to severe groundwater pollution. Pollution not only affects water quality but also threatens human health and socioeconomic development. Assessment of groundwater pollution is, thus, an important aspect for proper civilization and also for development of database for future planning of water resources developmental strategies (Subba Rao 2012). In view of this, tracer tests, hydrochemical and microbiological investigations are suitable methods for providing a scientific basis {{for the development of}} sustainable groundwater protection schemes (Bably Prasad et al. 2014; Bakalowicz 2005).|$|R
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1971 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 22 - 23, 1971, Tempe, ArizonaSewage {{effluent}} {{is commonly}} used for the irrigation of crops that are not consumed raw. Due to continued population growth in the Salt River Valley, Arizona, economic reuse of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> is becoming essential. The salt river bed has about 3 ft of fine loamy sand underlain by sand and gravel layers to great depth and a groundwater table at about 10 ft depth. These conditions are very favorable for high-rate <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> reclamation by groundwater recharge. The activated sludge plant in phoenix will probably be discharging 250 mgd by the year 2000. At 4. 5 ft average annual water use, this could irrigate about 70, 000 acres, possibly more than agriculture will need at that time. A sewage effluent renovation pilot project was located about 1. 5 miles from the plant. It contains 6 parallel recharge basins 20 to 700 ft each, spaced 20 ft apart. The basins were covered by grass, gravel or were left bare. Observation wells were installed at various locations in the area. Results indicated that infiltration rates were fastest in the grassy basins. Phosphate, nitrogen and median fecal coliform levels were all lower after this form of tertiary treatment. Practical details of the application of this water reclamation method in the Salt River Valley are outlined.
