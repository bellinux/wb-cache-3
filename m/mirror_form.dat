Night Ways, exhibited at Mary Boone Gallery in NYC in 2005, is an example using time sequenced LED's {{in combination with the}} tradition of drawing as a work on paper. Another example, Induction: Symptom 1, a large floor sculpture consisting of strips of laminated neoprene and <b>mirror</b> <b>form</b> a large funhouse image of interwoven rubber brushstrokes and reflections. The sculpture was first exhibited in the artist's survey exhibition [...] "Karin Davie: Dangerous Curves", at the Albright Knox Art Gallery and later reconfigured at Mary Boone Gallery, NYC and Galleria La Citta in Italy. She also exhibited Introvert, an LED illuminated cast wall piece with finger holes, alongside six oil paintings from the Symptomania series as part of her solo exhibition in 2010 at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art. Both of these mixed media pieces refer back to earlier series, My Inside Out and Liar, from 1996-2000, using poured rubber and mirrored glass polka dots on paper.|$|E

5000|$|The word matriarchy, for {{a society}} {{politically}} led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted {{to mean the}} genderal opposite of patriarchy, {{but it is not}} an opposite. According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a <b>mirror</b> <b>form</b> of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy [...] "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women {{play a central role in}} these practices. Journalist Margot Adler wrote, [...] "literally, ... "matriarchy" [...] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women." [...] Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, [...] "by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared." [...] According to Cynthia Eller, [...] "'matriarchy' can be thought of ... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'" [...] Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism. The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism. With respect to a prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age, according to Barbara Epstein, [...] "matriarchy ... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power." [...] According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society [...] "where women and men share equally in production and power." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} ability to recognize three mirror forms in visual and acoustic tasks: inversion (reflection on a horizontal axis), retrograde (reflection on a vertical axis) and retrograde inversion (reflection on both horizontal and vertical axes). Dynamic patterns consisting of five tones in succession in the acoustic condition and five square dots in succession in the visual condition were presented to 180 non-musically expert participants. In a yes/no task, they were asked to ascertain whether a comparison stimulus represented the “target” transformation (i. e., inversion, retrograde or retrograde inversion). Three main results emerged. Firstly, the fact that symmetry pertaining to a vertical axis is the most easily perceived does not only apply to static visual configurations (as found in previous literature) but also applies to dynamic visual configurations and acoustic stimuli where it is in fact even more marked. Secondly, however, differences emerged between the facility with which the three mirror forms were recognized in the acoustic and visual tasks. Thirdly, when the five elements in the stimulus were not of the same duration and therefore a rhythmic structure emerged, performance improved not only in the acoustic but also (even more significantly) in the visual task.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new concept}} for producing, on a single substrate, a two-dimensional array of optical interference filters where the pass-band of each element can be independently specified. The interference filter is formed by optically contacting two dielectric mirrors so that the top quarter-wave films of the two <b>mirrors</b> <b>form</b> a Fabry-Perot cavity having a half-wave thickness. In the new device, we propose to etch an array of sub-wavelength patterns into the top surface {{of one of the}} <b>mirrors</b> before <b>forming</b> the cavity. The patterns must have a pitch shorter than the operational wavelength in order to eliminate diffraction. By changing the index of refraction of the half-wave layer, or the optical thickness of the cavity, the patterning is used to shift the pass-band and form an array of interference filters. One approach to producing the array is to change the fill factor of the pattern. Once the filter array is produced it may be mated to a two-dimensional detector array to form a miniature spectrophotometer...|$|R
