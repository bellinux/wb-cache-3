40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{and spinal}} muscular atrophy (SMA) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders involving <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> The aetiology of the non-familial forms is still unknown {{but it has been}} suggested that long-term exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In 53 patients suffering from ALS (n = 42) and SMA (n = 9) the oral administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, 20 mg/kg) did not result in a greater mobilization of lead and mercury from peripheral depots than in control subjects.

40|$|Integral {{membrane}} proteins of the DP 1 and reticulon {{families are}} responsible for maintaining the high membrane curvature required for both smooth ER tubules and the edges of ER sheets. Mutations in these proteins lead to <b>motor</b> <b>neurone</b> <b>diseases</b> such as hereditary spastic paraplegia. Reticulon/DP 1 proteins contain Reticulon Homology Domains (RHD) that have unusually long (≈ 30 aa) hydrophobic segments and are proposed to adopt intramembrane helical hairpins that stabilise membrane curvature. I have uncovered the secondary structure and dynamics of the DP 1 protein Yop 1 p and identified a C-terminal conserved amphipathic helix that on its own interacts strongly with negatively charged membranes and is necessary for membrane tubule formation. Analyses of DP 1 and reticulon family members indicate that most, if not all, contain C-terminal sequences capable of forming amphipathic helices. Together, {{these results indicate that}} amphipathic helices play a previously unrecognised role in RHD membrane curvature stabilisation.

In order to treat the affected mice from birth, the mothers were administered 2. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o., SR[*] 57746 A every two days until the weaning of the offspring (at day 20); then the offspring were given every two days a dose of 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, p. o., until their death. Affected mice treated with SR[*] 57746 A had a lifespan 50 % longer than that of the vehicle-treated mice (P= 0. 01). Compared to vehicle-treated pmn mice, SR[*] 57746 A improved the performance of the pmn mice in three different behavioural tasks. SR[*] 57746 A also maintained the amplitude of the motor evoked response of the gastrocnemius muscle, reduced the distal motor latency, and delayed the occurrence of the spontaneous denervation activity in this muscle. Histological studies indicated that at 20 days of age the mean surface areas of the fibres of the sciatic nerve were higher in SR[*] 57746 A-treated than in vehicle-treated mice.

40|$|Konzo (caused by {{consumption}} of improperly processed cassava, Manihot esculenta) and neurolathyrism (caused by prolonged over{{consumption of}} grass pea, Lathyrus sativus) are two distinct non-infectious upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurone</b> <b>diseases</b> with identical clinical symptoms of spastic paraparesis of the legs. They affect {{many thousands of}} people among the poor in the remote rural areas in the central and southern parts of Africa afflicting them with konzo in Ethiopia and in the Indian sub-continent with neurolathyrism. Both diseases are toxico-nutritional problems due to monotonous consumption of starchy cassava roots or protein-rich grass pea seeds as a staple, especially during drought and famine periods. Both foods contain toxic metabolites (cyanogenic glycosides in cassava and the neuro-excitatory amino acid b-ODAP in grass pea) that are blamed for theses diseases. The etiology is also linked to the deficiency in the essential sulfur amino acids that protect against oxidative stress. The two diseases are not considered reportable by the World Health Organization (WHO) and only estimated numbers can be found. This paper analyzes research performance and determines scientific interest in konzo and neurolathyrism. A literature search of over 21 years (from 1990 to 2010) shows {{that in terms of}} scientific publications there is little interest in these neglected motorneurone diseases konzo and neurolathyrism that paralyze the legs.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of functioning and well-being {{from the perspective}} of the patient has in recent years become central to the assessment of health and the evaluation of treatment regimes. The past decade has seen an enormous growth in the application of measures designed to assess quality of life in a vast array of medical specialties. However, the use of such measures in neurology has been relatively limited, and this has certainly been the case in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The European ALS Health Profile Study is a longitudinal survey of patients diagnosed with ALS or other <b>motor</b> <b>neurone</b> <b>diseases</b> in which patients are asked to complete questionnaires concerning their subjective health status. Data from clinical assessments are also collected. It is intended that the information collected will provide more systematic and detailed evidence of the impact of the disease {{from the perspective of}} the patient. This contribution documents results from baseline assessment obtained from data supplied by clinicians, carers and patients themselves. Three outcome measures are assessed in this paper: the SF- 36, a generic measure of well being and functioning, the ALS Functional Rating Scale and the Carer Strain Index. The evidence presented here suggests that these measures provide a meaningful and valid picture of the impact of the disease. The data indicate that ALS has substantial adverse effects both upon the functioning and well being of patients and carers, as well as an association between the emotional health status of patients and carers, and between the physical health status of patients and carers...|$|R

40|$|The uropods of decapod {{crustaceans}} play a {{major role}} in the production of thrust during escape swimming. Here we analyse the output connections of a pair of giant interneurones, that mediate and co-ordinate swimming tail flips, on <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> that control the exopodite muscles of the uropods. The lateral giants make short latency output connections with phasic uropod <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> including the productor, the lateral abductor and adductor exopodite <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> that we have identified both physiologically and anatomically. On the other hand, tonic <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> including the ventral abductor and reductor exopodite <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> receive no input from the lateral giants.

Aims To investigate whether risks of Alzheimer’s, <b>motor</b> <b>neurone</b> or Parkinson’s <b>disease</b> are related to occupational exposure to magnetic fields. Methods The mortality experienced by a cohort of 73 051 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1973 – 2010. All employees were hired in the period 1952 – 82, were employed for at least 6  months and had some employment after 1 January 1973. Detailed calculations had been performed by others to enable an assessment {{to be made of}} exposures to magnetic fields. Poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (rate ratios) of developing any of the three diseases under investigation for categories of lifetime, distant (lagged) and recent (lugged) exposure. Results No statistically significant trends were shown for risks of any of these diseases to increase with esti-mates of lifetime, recent or distant exposure to magnetic fields. Conclusions There is no convincing evidence that UK electricity generation and transmission workers have suf-fered elevated risks from neurodegenerative diseases as a consequence of exposure to magnetic fields.
