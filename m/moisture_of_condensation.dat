40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the technology of}} utilizing the heat <b>of</b> exhaust gas <b>moisture</b> from heat recovery steam gases (HRSG) of combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT).

40|$|Though heating, insulation, wall {{claddings}} and cavity-wall construction {{are considered}} as measures for remediating moisture and condensation in buildings, ventilation of wall cavities has however become a mantra among architects and other building professionals. Holes {{of any size}} and shape are made and located on building facades based on the accepted wisdom that a little air movement will keep the wall cavities dry. Whilst ventilation {{has been found to}} be successful in the control <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> and <b>condensation</b> in rooms and larger enclosures, there is however insufficient understanding of how it works in thin spaces with high aspect ratios, such as the wall cavities studied in this thesis. In order to put in place good control and management practices in the remediation <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> and <b>condensation</b> in vertical wall cavities by natural ventilation, it is vital to understand the dynamics of airflow in these cavities. In this thesis therefore, different size and shape of slots were employed to numerically investigate the effects of size, spacing and number of the slots on the characteristics of the velocity fields (patterns of airflow and distributions of velocity) in different cavity models. The Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) methodology was employed to simulate the cavity flows under different modelling conditions using FLUENT. The BS 5925 model, an empirical relation for predicting ventilation rates in rooms and other larger enclosures, was employed and modified to predict ventilation rates in these cavities. Experimentally, the mapping of the airstreams in these cavities was obtained under similar reference (inlet) wind speeds employed for the numerical investigations. The results of this study show that there exists a potential at higher wind speeds for natural ventilation in the remediation <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> and <b>condensation</b> in the cavities of vertical walls. The steady state approach employed in the RANS-based computation of cavity flows in this thesis averages out the peak values of air velocities and therefore gives no information about regions of maxima or minima velocity values even at higher wind speeds. This makes the predicted air change rates insensitive to the inlet air velocities from the ventilation slots and therefore makes the results more applicable for long term control and management <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> in these cavities. In order to therefore put in place short, medium and long term plans for remediation <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> in these wall cavities, a time-dependent computation is required. This will also allow the efficiency of the cavity ventilation to be properly assessed. Using the modified BS 5925 model, reasonable predictions were obtained for the air change rates of the wall cavities with the different size of ventilation slots employed. Close agreements are also obtained at lower and higher wind speeds between the predicted ventilation rates from the modified BS 5925 model and the experimental results employed as benchmark for validating the results.

Laboratory and computer studies {{were used to}} examine aeration with cool and high humidity air to alleviate both deficiencies, while maintaining grain quality with safe storage conditions. A wide range of high humidity aeration conditions was produced in the laboratory to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condensation</b> on the grain and moisture adsorption during and after cooling the grain. Computer simulations were used to evaluate long-term temperature and moisture changes from aeration. Results demonstrated the possibility of maintaining optimum grain temperature and moisture content when these processes are correctly managed. The tests showed that moisture accumulation (by adsorption), but not moisture condensation, needs to be monitored for safe aeration management. Unsafe storage conditions can occur when aerating for long, or even short, periods with high relative humidity air...|$|R

40|$|Voyager imaging, infrared, {{and radio}} {{observations}} for Saturn have been recently interpreted by Smith et al. (1982) {{as an indication}} that the jet streams observed at the cloud tops extend to depths greater than the 10, 000 -bar level. This analysis assumes a maximum latitudinal temperature contrast of a few percent, a mean atmospheric rotation rate at depth given by Saturn's ratio period, and no variation with latitude of the bottom pressure level for the zonal flow system. These assumptions are not, however, firmly constrained by observation. The diagnostic analysis of plausible alternative configurations for Saturn's atmospheric structure demonstrates that a thin weather layer system (confined at mid to high latitudes to levels above 200 bar) cannot be excluded by any of the available observations. A quantitative estimate of the effects <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condensation</b> (including the differentiation of mean molecular weight) suggests that these might provide the buoyancy contrasts necessary to support a thin-layer flow provided that Saturn's outer envelope is enriched approximately 10 times in water abundance relative to a solar composition atmosphere and strongly differentiated with latitude at the condensation level...|$|R
