40|$|A {{procedure}} for identifying <b>misleading</b> advertising is presented, {{based solely on}} measured consumer beliefs. An advertisement is <b>misleading</b> if an exposed group holds more false beliefs than a comparison group. When ten allegedly <b>misleading</b> advertisements were tested, two were identified as incrementally <b>misleading,</b> and four others were shown to be exploitively <b>misleading.</b> Determining whether an ad is <b>misleading</b> continues to prove difficult and controversial. Naturally, advertis-ers and consumer advocates rarely agree on whether a par-ticular ad is <b>misleading.</b> More disappointing, however, is the failure of researchers {{to agree on a}} broadly applicable definition of misleadingness or a {{procedure for}} identifying it (Gardner 1975; Jacoby and Small 1975; Preston 1976). The problem is further complicated by the conflict between the behavioral paradigm of researchers and the jurispruden-tial view of regulatory organizations...|$|R

5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to <b>mislead</b> consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E

A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} false or <b>misleading</b> statements in messages posted by internet cancer support groups and whether these statements were identified as false or <b>misleading</b> and corrected by other participants in subsequent postings.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of false or <b>misleading</b> statements posted from 1 January to 23 April 2005 and whether these were identified and corrected by participants in subsequent postings. RESULTS: 10 of 4600 postings (0. 22 %) {{were found to be}} false or <b>misleading.</b> Of these, seven were identified as false or <b>misleading</b> by other participants and corrected within an average of four hours and 33 minutes (maximum, nine hours and nine minutes).

We then extend the model by introducing two types of heterogeneities; heterogeneous consumers and heterogeneous production costs between firms. <b>Misleading</b> Advertising, Regulation; Duopoly, Product Differentiation, Advertising Externality...|$|R

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and <b>mislead</b> the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E
