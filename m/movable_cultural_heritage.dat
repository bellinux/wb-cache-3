The analysis of spatial accuracy of the Europeana Geoparser is presented with the analysis of the Slovenian <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> objects.

In other words, what are the effects of the <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> protection regime on the owner? And are they balanced? Is it a model of action for the owners (effective) ? To answer the question, I will first briefly sketch the Belgian context of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> law before examining the effects of this law on the owner: the protective instruments and their obligations imposed on the owner in order to protect his monument or his cultural object. Secondly, I will analyse the proportionality of the imposed protection measures, and more specifically whether the law provides, as a counterpart and as another effect, some compensation to balance the imposed burdens on the owner...|$|R

The idea of establishing museums in Jordan and the region started after Europeans began to turn their attention to the antiquities and traditional objects of the Arab world, whether as Christian missionaries, colonists or private individuals. In Jordan, the Department of Antiquities was established and participated in protecting the <b>movable</b> and immovable <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> which led to the establishment of museums. The DOA created museums throughout the country to spread the awareness of archaeology and heritage and to house archaeological objects.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present some of the results of an ongoing project focused on {{protection}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> from flood danger. We present an original methodology of risk analysis of <b>movable</b> and immovable <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> and two supporting web applications: one for experts and one for ordinary users. <b>Cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> forms a special category that requires different approach towards risk mitigation than other ordinary objects. First of all their assets cannot be reproduced so we have to pay much more attention for the correct preventive measures as well as remedial works after the potential disaster. Second, historical materials are usually more predispose to damage as they are already eroded by age. This brings a need of profound knowledge of the mechanical, chemical and biological reaction to the flood stress. This knowledge is usually not possessed by the stewards and owners in the sufficient rate. This is probably not even possible, because it encompasses knowledge of various building branches from the view of hydrology, physics, biology, chemistry, geology and others. To be able to perform an effective risk analysis and to choose right effective measures means to know the building and its condition as well as its setting very well. Therefore we want to give users and administrators of the buildings clear guidelines how to examine the objects and what else they might need to be aware of, in order to be ready and prepared...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{provides}} an overview of international law pertaining to <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> protection, particularly in relation to <b>movable</b> <b>cultural</b> properties and related risks of dispersion and trafficking, aimed at providing useful starting points for a discussion of national and international criminal law policies in this area. More specifically, after analyzing the nature and definition of the objects of protection within international conventions and documents, the paper retraces what scanty and fragmentary provisions for the criminalization of offences against <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> can be found in international law (also with a specific attention to regional sources at European level), in order to draw a comprehensive picture of current trends and open problems in international criminal law policies with respect to cultural property trafficking, its prevention and its repression. Special attention is paid to the tendency to turn to ‘non-specific’ international conventions (mainly to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime) as a way to bypass traditional disagreements over criminalization of offences against <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> between source and market Countries, as well as an effective tool to fight a perceived increase in the involvement of organized criminal groups in cultural property trafficking. Finally, an attempt is made to define in a more precise way what ‘trafficking’ is, and how this typically international terminology could possibly be translated into national criminal law offences, also {{in the light of the}} most recent efforts of UN agencies (particularly UNODC) to establish a set of Guidelines for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Responses with Respect to Trafficking in Cultural Property and Other Related Offences...|$|R

40|$|<b>Movable</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is not bounded nor {{shielded}} {{by national}} territorial borders. Applicable domestic laws are of limited import without {{the cooperation of}} other states and the international community. Despite a century of domestic legal protection of <b>movable</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> in many states, widespread non-compliance and lack of enforcement has been the norm rather than the exception. However, the tide is turning. States formerly reluctant to ratify cultural heritage treaties have done so, signalling their acceptance {{of the importance of}} multilateral action in this field. Enforcement of such laws is viewed as part of the reinforcement of good governance, rule of law and human rights in the international and domestic spheres. This new found international cooperation has emerged within the context of developments in human rights law which have necessarily redefined and informed initiatives to combat the illicit traffic of cultural objects. These efforts are clarifying the nature of the obligations owed by states (and non-state actors) in respect of protection of movable heritage, and expanded the right-holder beyond the state – to individuals and groups. This chapter seeks to outline recent developments in the human rights law and international law for the protection of cultural heritage which manifest this interrelation as it pertains to movable heritage. Part One focuses on the obligations on states and non-state actors in leading international instruments for the protection of movable heritage including prevention of its illicit transfer during armed conflict, belligerent occupation and peacetime. Part Two details how human rights norms have been referenced in multilateral instruments for the protection of cultural heritage; and examines the relationship between controls on the export of cultural material and specific human rights, namely, the right to property, right to self-determination, right to participate in cultural life, and minority protection...|$|E
