5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her <b>miserable,</b> <b>and</b> that she had effectively been a slave.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> decrepit at the story's end.|$|E

He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, that {{he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E
25|$|Together with Fredrik Ström and Hannes Sköld, Höglund {{wrote the}} anti-militarist {{manifesto}} Det befästa fattighuset (The Fortress Poorhouse) {{in which they}} described and criticized Sweden as an armed fortress {{and at the same}} time a poorhouse, where the people were <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> the rulers spent all resources on militarism. Not one krona, not one öre, to militarism! was the slogan of the manifesto. It was despised from the bourgeoisie politicians and media.|$|E

While Annie wasn't too upset about being moved, accepting the situation cheerfully as she usually seems to do, Susanne, the maid, was angered that Annie had been moved.|$|E

25|$|A family dispute {{became the}} final straw. For some time, {{relations}} between Carrie {{and her brother}} Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896, an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling {{on the street and}} threatened him with physical harm. The incident led to Beatty's eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing, and the resulting publicity, Kipling's privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States, and returned to England.|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to Hungary, Andrew complained to Pope Honorius that his kingdom was [...] "in a <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> destroyed state, deprived of all of its revenues." [...] A group of barons had even expelled Archbishop John from Hungary. Andrew was in massive debt because of his crusade, which forced him to impose extraordinarily high taxes and debase coinage. In 1218 or 1219, Mstislav Mstislavich invaded Halych and captured Andrew's son, Coloman. Andrew compromised with Mstislavich. Coloman was released, and Andrew's youngest son and namesake was betrothed to Mstislavich's daughter. In 1220, a group of lords persuaded Andrew to make his eldest son, Béla, the Duke of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia.|$|E
500|$|The {{lives of}} all five become more <b>miserable,</b> <b>and</b> each {{conforms}} to the regime's demands even as they lose their jobs for apparently political reasons. They discuss fleeing the country, and Georg {{is the first to}} do so. Weeks after he arrives in Germany, he is found dead from a fall from the window of a Frankfurt hotel. The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, but continue to receive death threats after emigrating. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working; he is later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: [...] "When we don't speak, said Edgar, we become unbearable, and when we do, we make fools of ourselves".|$|E
500|$|Part two, [...] "La Femme sans cœur", is narrated as a {{flashback}} from Valentin's point of view. He complains {{to his friend}} Émile about his early days as a scholar, living in poverty with an elderly landlord and her daughter Pauline, while trying fruitlessly to win {{the heart of a}} beautiful but aloof woman named Foedora. Along the way he is tutored by an older man named Eugène de Rastignac, who encourages him to immerse himself in the world of high society. Benefiting from the kindness of his landladies, Valentin maneuvers his way into Foedora's circle of friends. Unable to win her affection, however, he becomes the <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> destitute man found at the start of [...] "Le Talisman".|$|E

500|$|Waugh's first biographer, Christopher Sykes, {{records that}} after the divorce friends [...] "saw, or {{believed}} they saw, a new hardness and bitterness" [...] in Waugh's outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he [...] "did not know {{it was possible to}} be so <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> live", he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, Vile Bodies, and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the Daily Mail on the meaning of the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.|$|E
500|$|Hilary is sent with {{a search}} party {{to find the}} missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse. [...] She finds Marie, who is <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> frightened and wants {{to return to the}} school {{whatever}} the consequences. Margaret confesses that she [...] borrowed [...] the £5 to bet on a horse, and has won £100. She means to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary's search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors' clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend.|$|E
500|$|Hadley's {{proposal}} {{has been placed}} {{in the context of}} the [...] "political turn" [...] in animal ethics; the emergence of animal ethics literature focused on justice. Another academic who has proposed that wild animals be afforded property rights over their habitats is the British philosopher Steve Cooke. Like Hadley, he utilises an interest-based account of animal rights, but, unlike Hadley, he suggests that sovereignty would be an appropriate tool to protect animals' interest in their habitat if property fails. Other theorists exploring the normative aspects of human relationships with wild animals explicitly deny that they are extending property rights to animals. The US-based ethicist Clare Palmer, for instance, argues for a duty to respect wild animals' space, but claims that arguing for a property right for these animals would be [...] "difficult", and instead bases her account on the fact that human actions can make animals [...] "painful, <b>miserable</b> <b>and</b> vulnerable".|$|E
