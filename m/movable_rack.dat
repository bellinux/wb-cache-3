5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included <b>movable</b> <b>rack</b> sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{continued}} on weight changes in marble and limestone briquettes {{exposed to the}} outdoor environment at sites in the eastern US. This report presents data for the exposure period 1988 - 1992 and summarizes results for the entire period from 1984. Since 1989, only three exposure sites have remained active, but briquettes from pre-exposed material were added at those sites. A linear relationship was found between cumulative gravimetric losses and exposure period. These losses resulted in an average recession rate of 11 to 21 micrometers/yr for marble and 21 to 45 micrometers/yr for limestone. The recession rates are site-dependent and can be described with respect to rain depth and other atmospheric conditions, {{as evidenced by the}} very low rates at the Ohio site on the <b>movable</b> <b>rack,</b> dry regime. Weight monitoring is continuing in a planned 10 -year program...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project FRIENDCOPTER, the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Politecnico di Milano is involved in developing active control systems aimed at reducing the vibration transmission from the gearbox to the cabin in medium-size civil helicopters. An AgustaWestland A 109 MKII mock-up to perform vibroacoustic measurements and control tests. The selected active configuration consists of two smart rear struts with 4 piezoceramic actuators pairs each and a smart anti-torque plate with 6 piezo pacthes on each side. Four independent narrowband FXLMS vibration controllers are designed and implemented to control each beam and {{the two sides of the}} plate. From open-loop vibration and acoustic analysis, a set of annoying tones in a frequency band up to 4 kHz are targeted to be reduced. A <b>movable</b> <b>rack</b> of microphones is placed inside the cabin to monitor the acoustic field over a grid spreading the whole cabin width in an area close to the passenger back seats. Vibration reductions up to 20 dB of the target tones are obtained on the accelerometer error sensors. Acceptable noise reductions of a few tones are achieved over certain zones, but the result cannot be extended to the whole cabin. An optimization algorithm to find the best positioning of the error sensors has been also tested to improve acoustic closed-loop performances...|$|E

40|$|This thesis project {{seeks to}} {{optimize}} floor layouts for semiconductor equipment assembly operations. The assembly of semiconductor equipment {{is characterized by}} low volume and high product diversity and complexity. Demand for semiconductor equipment is highly periodic and often shifts rapidly from one type of semiconductor equipment to the other. Thus, {{the goal is to}} develop an assembly system that easily handles high part counts per assembly and facilitates material management, {{but at the same time}} allows reacting to changes in demand quickly and efficiently. Lead time and floor space usage are further metrics that are considered. Capturing the current state of the floor layout in a 3 D drawing software and documenting important aspects of current operations is the first step towards achieving those goals. Current assembly operations consist of the build of subassemblies in dedicated cells and the final assembly of machines in dedicated build lines. That is, each type of product is assembled in a specific area and the required inventory is stored within these areas. In order to increase production flexibility, reduce inventory levels, and to lower floor space usage, a new assembly system is developed. This system features consolidated inventory for both the build of subassemblies and final assembly. It is proposed that technicians pull parts for subassemblies by driving with a cart and attached foam cut-outs as part trays through an inventory aisle. This aisle accommodates inventory for all subassemblies, which is currently stored within approximately 20 cells spread over the production floor. (cont.) Subsequently, technicians drive these carts to generic workbenches and start assembly. Using generic, standardized workbenches rather than dedicated workbenches boosts flexibility and efficiency. Parts for the final assembly would be kitted for each machine by material handlers on <b>movable</b> <b>racks.</b> This allows building any type of machine in any area of the production floor. A block system is proposed to decouple assembly of different machines and to enable easy management of assembly operations. A floor layout based on these ideas is developed. Finally, a pilot proposal is developed to serve as a stepping stone towards full scale implementation and this proposal is in part physically implemented. by Richard Clemens Schwenke. Thesis (M.

60|$|C is a {{travelling}} carriage {{that supports the}} portraits in turn, from which the composite has to be made. I work directly from the original negatives with transmitted light; but prints {{can be used with}} light falling on their face. For convenience of description I will confine myself to the first instance only, and will therefore speak of C as the carriage that supports the frame that holds the negative transparencies. C can be pushed along the board and be clamped anywhere, and it has a rack and pinion adjustment; but it should have been made <b>movable</b> by <b>rack</b> and pinion along the whole length of the board. The frame for the transparencies has the same movements of adjustment as those in the stage of a microscope. It rotates round a hollow axis, through which a beam of light is thrown, and independent movements in the plane, at right angles to the axis, can be given to it in two directions, at right angles to one another, by turning two separate screws. The beam of light is furnished by three gas-burners, and it passes through a condenser. The gas is supplied through a flexible tube that does not interfere with the movements of C, and it is governed by a stop-cock in front of the operator.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is a {{new technology}} that provides accurate and dense 3 D measurements from the object. Development of laser scanners and techniques has led to several successful applications {{in the field of}} land surveying, forestry, industrial design and city planning. However, airborne laser scanners have not broken through in the field of agriculture and precision planning due to high expenses and insufficient accuracy, where as terrestrial laser scanners on the tripod are considered to be impractical for operational use. However, in the future we may have low-cost laser scanners mounted e. g. on UAVs enabling the cost-efficient use of laser scanning for precision agriculture as they are presently used in forestry. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate how laser scanners and laser point data can be exploited in agriculture and precision farming. Growth height and ear recognition of cultivated plants were investigated using laser scanner data. The test area of this study is located in the Kotkaniemi Experimental Station of Kemira GrowHow Ltd in Southern Finland. Cereal cultivars were sown in plots of 1. 25 m x 10 m on 6 th May 2006. Plots were fertilized at various rates corresponding to 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg of N/ha. Three small grain cereals (barley, oat and wheat) with five different rates of fertilizer were scanned six times using Faro terrestrial laser scanner during the growing season of 2006. Faro laser scanner was mounted on a <b>movable</b> <b>rack</b> specially made for this study. The rack was about 3 meter high and Faro scanner scanned the ground beneath it. Test plots were signalled using white plastic disks and their location was measured using tachymeter. Besides, digital photographs, soil moisture values and growth height using tape measure were collected from each test plot an...|$|E
