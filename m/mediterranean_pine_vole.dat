40|$|The Lusitanian and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus lusitanicus Gerbe, 1879 and Microtus duodecimcostatus de Selys-Longchamps, 1839) are fossorial sister {{species and}} have an {{allopatric}} pattern of distribution in Portugal, which includes a potential sympatry area in {{the centre of the}} country. The present study aimed to etermine the validity of using presence signs in the field for discrimination of the two species in an area of sympatry (Northern Alentejo) and the characteristics that achieve the best classification accuracy. A total of 175 trapping plots were sampled across the study area. Prior to the set up of traps, ten presence signs were randomly selected for measurements of four variables: proportion of soil mounds, mean diameter of mounds, proportion of burrow openings and mean diameter of burrow openings. On the basis of a classification tree analysis, results showed that presence signs can be used to discriminate plots inhabited by one or the other species in the studied sympatry area. The characteristic that most accurately enables species identification is the proportion of burrow openings: for every ten presence signs found in a plot, if more than eight have an opening, then it is inhabited by M. lusitanicus (i. e. mostly burrow openings with few or no mounds present); if eight or fewer have an opening, M. duodecimcostatus is present (i. e. mostly mounds with few or no burrow openings) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the relative contributions {{of local and}} landscape factors, and of spatial structure on the regional distribution of both the Lusitanian (Microtus lusitanicus Gerbe, 1879) and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus duodecimcostatus de Selys-Longchamps, 1839) over an area of 1613 km 2 within a Mediterranean landscape in central Portugal. Three sets of explanatory variables (20 local, 23 landscape, and 6 spatial) were analysed independently {{by means of a}} generalized linear model, followed by a variance partitioning procedure. Variance in the distribution patterns of M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus largely was explained by ﬁne-scale environmental factors but spatial effects also were important, especially for the distribution of M. duodecimcostatus. The close proximity of verges and the high abundance of humidity and coarse sand in the soil were the most inﬂuencing local-scale factors for the presence of M. lusitanicus; meanwhile on a larger scale, the high abundance of linear habitats was the main landscape feature determining its occurrence. Regarding the presence of M. duodecimcostatus, the close proximity of verges, high tree canopy cover and herbaceous vegetation biomass were the most inﬂuential local explanatory variables for its occurrence, while the absence of shrubs in the surrounding habitat was the main factor regulating species presence at a landscape scale. Similarities identiﬁed between the two species primarily were related to descriptors of cover, food and burrows, while differences were related to opposing spatial trends and coarse-scale descriptors...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> is {{endemic to}} the greater Iberian Peninsula. Its range extends from {{southern}} France through Andorra, Portugal, and Spain, except for the northwestern corner of Spain, at altitudes of up to 2,250 m. It is widespread throughout its range and in some parts is common, with four hundred to six hundred animals per hectare having been recorded. It does not experience wide population swings as does the woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum). This species is mostly found in lowland areas where the soil is deep and light.

50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> {{is mainly}} diurnal. It makes an {{extensive}} network of shallow tunnels, throwing up small piles of earth as it excavates.

A chamber is prepared deep in the burrow system and lined with dried vegetation. In this a litter of up to eight young are born after a gestation period of about twenty days. Life expectancy is about two years with two males in a study being recaptured 33 months after their original capture. These are believed to be the longest individual lifespans of voles ever recorded.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a pest species in fruit orchards of the eastern United States (Hamilton 1935). These semifossorial rodents construct tunnel systems beneath apple trees where they eat entire roots or strip roots of bark and cambium. Hamilton (1938) reported numbers of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> within apple orchards as high as 200 - 300 voles per acre which is {{in sharp contrast to}} the relative scarcity of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> outside orchard situations (Crain and Packard 1966; Goertz 1971), These findings suggest that orchard habitat provides excellent conditions for <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> growth and reproduction, although the specific components which are attractive to <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and facilitate their proliferation remain poorly understood. Prior studies have suggested that <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> habitat selection is based on preference for a complex of habitat components including cover density (Benton 1955; Paul 1970; Goertz 1971), food resources (Noffsinger 1976), soil texture (Fisher and Anthony 1980), and soil moisture (Haines and Gier 1951; Miller 1964). With regard to the latter two variables, Miller (1964) and Best (1973) have presented evidence indicating that soil texture is a primary factor limiting the distribution of some fossorial mammals but soil moisture content may also be of importance (Miller 1948). The extent to which these soil properties influence the distribution and abundance of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> is presently unclear.

40|$|Roads {{are widely}} {{recognized}} {{to represent a}} barrier to individual movements and, conversely, verges can act as potential corridors for the dispersal of many small mammals. Both barrier and corridor effects should generate a clear spatial pattern in genetic structure. Nevertheless, the effect of roads on the genetic structure of small mammal populations still remains unclear. In this study, we examine the barrier effect that different road types (4 -lane highway, 2 -lane roads and single-lane unpaved roads) may have on the population genetic structure of three species differing in relevant life history traits: southern water vole Arvicola sapidus, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus duodecimcostatus and the Algerian mouse Mus spretus. We also examine the corridor effect of highway verges on the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> and the Algerian mouse. We analysed the population structure through pairwise estimates of FST among subpopulations bisected by roads, identified genetic clusters through Bayesian assignment approaches, and used simple and partial Mantel tests to evaluate the relative barrier or corridor effect of roads. No strong evidences were found for an effect of roads on population structure of these three species. The barrier effect of roads seems to be site-specific and no corridor effect of verges was found for the pine vole and Algerian mouse populations. The lack of consistent results among species and for each road type lead {{us to believe that}} the ability of individual dispersers to use those crossing structures or the habitat quality in the highway verges may have a relatively higher influence on gene flow among populations than the presence of crossing structures per se.

40|$|The {{control of}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> through manual bait {{placement}} is too fastidious. It prevents the realization of collective control on large areas.

This plough was successfully tested in fall 1989 in apple orchards with a wheat-based bait treated with chlorophacinone, chosen for its good resistance to moisture. The treatment efficiency varied between 86. 7 % and 96. 4 % with 25 and 50 artificial runs per hectare, respectively. A humid but well-dried-out (i. e., moist but not wet) soil is the necessary condition for successful treatments so that the runs may not collapse. New tests with other types of baits in other crops overrun by the Mediterranean vole are necessary to confirm these results...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{analyzed}} the coexistence {{pattern of the}} Lusitanian pine vole (Microtus lusitanicus) and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus duodecimcostatus) in a potential area of sympatry in a Mediterranean landscape (Portugal). We also determined the relative contribution of local, landscape, and spatial factors explaining the diﬀerences in the distribution patterns of the two species in the region. Using a kriging interpolation method, we obtained a map of sympatric and allopatric areas of species occurrence. The estimated sympatry area corresponded to a north-west–southeast belt representing 11. 3 % of the study area. Habitat niche differences were assessed with binomial GLMs followed by a variance partitioning. At a local scale, higher altitude, higher cover of shrubs, lower clay content in the soil, and lower cover of tree canopy {{were the most important}} factors distinguishing M. lusitanicus presence sites from those with M. duodecimcostatus. At a larger scale, the presence of forest landscape units and the low abundance of ‘‘montado’’ units were the most inﬂuencing landscape factors in the identiﬁcation of M. lusitanicus occurrence sites when compared to M. duodecimcostatus. Our results suggested that local coexistence of M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus in the ﬁeld is a rare event.

40|$|Habitat {{selection}} by <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) {{has been}} attributed to cover density (Goertz, 1971; Paul, 1970) soil condition (Benton, 1955; Fisher and Anthony, 1980), and food resources (Noffsinger, 1976; Paul, 1970). Goertz (1971) reported that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> were distributed in diverse habitats, but there was a close correlation with height and diversity of grass. Miller and Getz (1969) found populations in sloping upland woods, Benton (1955) in dry woods, and Paul (1970) in hardwood slopes with a close correlation between distribution and amount of ground cover. Soil type has been examined by Benton (1955) and Fisher and Anthony (1980) and they have shown that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> are associated with light soils containing moderate layers of humus. These factors are important to reduce predation, moderate the effect of rain and temperatures, and permit the excavation of fossorial nests and tunnels. Noffsinger (1976) has demonstrated that the amount of digestible energy and availability of food sources were important factors affecting birth and death rates of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> when abandoned and maintained orchards were compared. Behavioral characteristics of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> have been associated with decreased meadow <b>vole</b> density as <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> appear to be a more aggressive species (Smith, 1975). Paul (1970) has shown that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> appear to replace meadow voles when they are sympatric in favorable habitats. Trapping and telemetry methods indicate that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> have low dispersal capacity and home ranges 100 m 2 or less in size (Gettle, 1975). All these reports are from established <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> populations and not from the initial colonizing event and subsequent development of a local population. Therefore, this research project is directed at understanding what site qualities permit <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> colonization in areas where they have been historically absent, but where its competitor, the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), is common...|$|R

Scat analysis (n = 101 faeces; n = 402 prey items) showed that the diet is based on rodents, fundamentally wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus duodecimcostatus and south-western water vole Arvicola sapidus.

Red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa and carrion also played an important role, especially in biomass terms. The overall diet differed essentially from that of the Mediterranean region, which surrounds the study area, since in these areas rabbits constitute the primary prey. However, the diet of the mountain wildcats is similar to that in the Eurosiberian floral region, despite its distance from the Sierra Nevada. In conclusion, the Iberian wildcat seems to behave as a facultative specialist, since it prefers rabbits whenever they are available, but rodents constitute most of its diet if rabbits are scarce or absent...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Ecologia), 2010, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de CiênciasThe {{main goal}} of this thesis was to {{determine}} the environmental factors influencingthe distribution of two closely related voles in Portugal. More specifically the aimwas to analyse and compare the environmental preferences of the Lusitanian pinevole (Microtus lusitanicus (Gerbe, 1879)) and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtusduodecimcostatus Sélys-Longchamps, 1839), at different scales of analysis, andalso to quantify the importance of spatial autocorrelation component in speciesdistribution models. At a national level the distribution pattern of pine voles was associated with climatevariables, landscape units, and soil types. The environmental associations at alandscape scale reflected the importance of habitat connectivity and heterogeneityfor the Lusitanian pine vole, and of open areas, free of shrubs, for theMediterranean pine vole. At a local scale, the high importance of verges, especiallyfor the Lusitanian pine vole, highlights the several advantages of these particularvegetation structures for small mammals. The sympatric area of both pine voles was consistently narrow in national andregional distribution maps. Results indicated that the local coexistence of the twovoles should be a rare event. Vole distribution data were characterized by strong spatial autocorrelation evenafter accounting for several significant environmental effects. At the largest scalethe spatial effects were the most important. At a finer scale, these effects, althoughstill important, played a secondary role when explaining the species distributionsand segregation. Furthermore, novel information was provided on space use, social behaviour,activity patterns, and habitat selection of Lusitanian pine vole. The discrimination of the two species in the field, and in a potential sympatric area,was possible using presence signs, namely the proportion of burrow openings. Multiple factors may influence the distribution of pine voles in Portugal. Some ofthese factors gain importance at specific spatial scales and others can only bediscussed using more than one scale approach.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Evolutiva), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 The present Ph. D. project {{constituted}} {{a first step}} in understanding mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two recently diverged sister species: the Lusitanian pine vole Microtus lusitanicus and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus duodecimcostatus. Reproductive isolation is essential to speciation, and two types of isolation, preand post-mating, may prevent hybridization between two species. While premating barriers prevent copulation and promote conspecific reproduction, postmating barriers affect the success of heterospecific fertilization and hybrid viability, and potentiate its sterility. M. lusitanicus diverged from M. duodecimcostatus approximately 60, 000 years ago, constituting one of the most recent speciation events among Microtus sp. voles. While M. lusitanicus inhabits the Northern region of the Iberian Peninsula, reaching the French Pyrenees, M. duodecimcostatus occupies Southern Iberia and part of the South of France. There is also a sympatry area of distribution, where both species occur, located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, covering parts of Portugal and Spain. Analyses on cytochrome b and microsatellites have uncovered a cytonuclear discordance over a large geographic area in Portugal, indicating a historical introgression of mitochondrial DNA from M. duodecimcostatus to M. lusitanicus. An incomplete reproductive isolation in nature is also suggested between both voles since two possible hybrids were detected in a sample size of nearly three hundred individuals. Moreover, behavioural isolation was hinted at, since there is a preference for conspecific over heterospecific odour cues. The gametic isolation barrier was proposed since heterospecific mating, in laboratory conditions, is less reproductively prolific than conspecific mating. This result suggests that fertilization between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus may not always occur after copulation, probably due to incompatibilities in the sperm-oocyte heterospecific recognition. Considering these previous findings, the present Ph. D. project focused on M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus reproductive isolation, particularly on premating behavioural and post-mating gametic isolation barriers. It comprises five specific aims: 1) identify candidate genes related to odour cues communication; 2) analyse the expression of urinary proteins in both species; 3) infer if both species favour conspecific to heterospecific mating; 4) determine if both species present a pair bond, indicative of a monogamous mating system; and 5) evaluate the role of the sperm-binding protein zona pellucida 3, as a gametic isolation barrier. Four hypotheses were tested: 1) odour cues communication is an active behavioural reproductive barrier between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus; 2) M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus prefer conspecific to heterospecific mating in the presence of potential mates of both species; 3) M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus are socially monogamous; and 4) the putative sperm-binding region of zona pellucida 3 is a gametic isolation barrier that impairs heterospecific mating between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus. The results of the present Ph. D. project suggest that reproductive isolation between these sister species relies on multiple barriers and is still incomplete, enabling sporadic hybridization in nature. Overall, results also indicate that urinary proteins {{may play a role in}} species-specific discrimination; confirm social monogamy as the mating system of both voles, being a possible indirect behavioural isolation barrier at syntopy; reveal that individual behavioural variability may contribute to the behavioural isolation between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus; and refute the putative sperm-binding region of ZP 3 as a gametic barrier.

Voles of both species showed a slight but significant tendency to remain closer to the tree rows after mowing. We conclude that rotary mowing has a negligible effect on vole movement and survival under the conditions of this study...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study at VPI 2 ̆ 6 SU, Servello (1981) developed a technique for predicting the digestible dry matter (DDM) and digestible energy (DE) of the diets of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> from a nutritive analysis of their stomach contents. In this nutritive analysis, developed by Goering and Van Soest (1970), feeds are divided into two major fractions: cell soluble and cell wall fractions. The cell soluble fraction is highly digestible while the cell wall (fiber) fraction varies in digestibility. It {{was found that the}} highly digestible cell soluble values of the stomach contents were the best predictor of the digestibility of the <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> 2 ̆ 7 s diet. The objective {{of the present study was}} to use the cell soluble values of <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> stomach contents to determine if there were seasonal or orchard differences in the diet digestibility of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> captured from diverse orchard habitat types...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} organization of free ranging animal populations is important to an understanding {{not only of the}} social behavior between members of those populations, but also of several demographic parameters of the population, including reproduction, dispersal and mortality. Such information is particularly important when viewed in the context of pest species management. The efficacy of control practices such as rodenticide application and habitat manipulation might be greatly enhanced if performed with an understanding of the organization and status of pest populations in mind. Early considerations of <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus pinetorum) {{spatial and temporal}} organization were based on the observations that several animals could be captured at 1 tree in an orchard (Hamilton 1938, Benton 1955). Paul (1970) reported a 2 ̆ 2 loose colonial 2 ̆ 2 organization of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in his study of North Carolina populations. More recently, FitzGerald and Madison (1981) have reported preliminary observations of discrete <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> 2 ̆ 2 family-units 2 ̆ 2 based on radiotelemetric data gathered in the late summer and fall seasons. The status of winter populations has not previously been investigated. This paper presents preliminary data on the spatio-temporal patterns of a winter <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> population. Of particular interest in this study are three questions 1) What is the composition of winter <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> aggregations? 2) What is the range of movement of these groups? and 3) How stationary are <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> during the winter...|$|R

40|$|Before more {{effective}} and reliable control methods for <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> populations can be developed, {{it is essential to}} increase our knowledge of the <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> 2 ̆ 7 s basic biology and ecology. Former research conducted by Estep et al (1978) and Noffsinger (1976) has demonstrated distinct differences in food habits, physiological condition and reproductive activity of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in active and abandoned orchards. A summary of their findings is presented in Kirkpatrick and Noffsinger (1977). Results from these studies has promoted an interest to more completely define population characteristics of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in these two orchard types. In this manner, {{it will be possible to}} enhance our knowledge of this species 2 ̆ 7 response and adaptability to habitats of different vegetative composition, structure and type. Utilizing capture-recapture techniques, we have undertaken a study to examine population structure, density, and movement of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in a maintained and an abandoned orchard. The two orchards are the same ones where Noffsinger (1976) previously collected voles in September 1974 through July 1975. The maintained orchard has had no form of vole control beyond mowing for five years. The other orchard has been completely abandoned for six years. Both orchards are the sane age and have similar topography and soil types...|$|R
