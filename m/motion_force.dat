6000|$|Carrying out his principle, M. Comte divides Mathematics into [...] "Abstract Mathematics, or the Calculus (taking {{the word}} in its most {{extended}} sense) and Concrete Mathematics, which is composed of General Geometry and of Rational Mechanics." [...] The subject-matter {{of the first of}} these is number; the subject-matter of the second includes space, time, <b>motion,</b> <b>force.</b> The one possesses the highest possible degree of generality; for all things whatever admit of enumeration. The others are less general; seeing that there are endless phenomena that are not cognisable either by general geometry or rational mechanics. In conformity with the alleged law, therefore, the evolution of the calculus must throughout have preceded the evolution of the concrete sub-sciences. Now somewhat awkwardly for him, the first remark M. Comte makes bearing upon this point is, that [...] "from an historical point of view, mathematical analysis appears to have risen out of the contemplation of geometrical and mechanical facts." [...] True, {{he goes on to say}} that, [...] "it is not the less independent of these sciences logically speaking;" [...] for that [...] "analytical ideas are, above all others, universal, abstract, and simple; and geometrical conceptions are necessarily founded on them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) was {{installed}} in the HRF-1 during Expedition 11. The SLAMMD measures the on-orbit mass of the crewmembers by applying Newton's second law of <b>motion</b> (<b>force</b> is equal to mass times acceleration). This device can measure a mass between 95 and 240 lb using the force generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer. Each spring {{is attached to a}} cam, which is also attached to a centrally located shaft with a flywheel mounted on top of it. The cam is designed such that, as the springs are stretched over a distance, a constant force is applied to the central shaft. A lanyard wrapped around the large flywheel is fed through a small slit on the SLAMMD front panel. The lanyard is latched onto the SLAMMD guiding arm, where the crewmember sits for a body mass measurement. Attached to the guiding arm is a leg support assembly around which the crew-member wraps his or her legs (as one would for a leg curl machine), a belly pad to help align the stomach, and a headrest.|$|E
5000|$|To {{experimentally}} {{find the}} curve resistance {{of a certain}} railroad freight car with a given load on its axles (partly due to {{the weight of the}} freight) the same car was tested both on a curved track and on a straight track. The difference in measured resistance(at the same speed) was assumed to be the curve resistance. [...] To get an average for several cars of the same type, and to reduce the effect of aerodynamic drag, one may test a group of the same type of cars coupled together (a short train without a locomotive). The curved track used in the experiments was the circular test track of the National Scientific Investigation Institute of Railroad Transport (ВНИИЖТ). A single test run can find the train resistance (force) at various velocities by letting the rolling stock being tested coast down from a higher speed to a low speed, while continuously measuring the deceleration and using Newton's second law of <b>motion</b> (<b>force</b> = acceleration*mass) to find the resistance force that is causing the railroad cars to slow. [...] In such calculations, one must take into account the moment of inertia of the car wheels by adding an equivalent mass (of rotating wheels) to the mass of the train consist. Thus the effective mass of a rail car used for Newton's second law, is larger than the car mass as weighed on a car weighing scale. This additional equivalent mass is tantamount to having the mass of each wheel-axle set be located at its radius of gyration See [...] "Inertia Resistance" [...] (for automobile wheels, but it's the same formula for railroad wheels).|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{quantity}} at {{the origin}} of the legitimacy of mathematization in physics Michel PATY* SUMMARY Newton's use of mathematics in mechanics was justified by him from his neo-platonician conception of the physical world that was going along with his «absolute, true and mathematical concepts » such as space, time, <b>motion,</b> <b>force,</b> etc. But physics, afterwards, although it was based on newtonian dynamics, meant differently the legitimacy of being mathematized, and this difference can be seen already in the works of eighteenth century «Geometers » such as Euler, Clairaut and d'Alembert (and later on Lagrange, Laplace and others).

Parallel {{manipulators}} {{has been}} extensively studied by virtues or its high force-to-weight ratio and widely spread applications such as vehicle or flight simulator, a machine tool and the end effector of robot system. However, as each limb includes several rigid joints, assembling error is demanded strictly, especially in precision measurement and micro-electronics.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there were differences in exposure to physical risk factors between genders in a series of standardized laboratory-based tasks on computer workstations adjusted to wubject anthropometry. METHODS: Thirty computer users (15 men and 15 women) completed five different tasks. Surface electromyography measured muscular activity in the shoulders (anterior deltoid, medial deltoid, and trapezius) and wrists (extensor carpi radialis, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris). Electrogoniometers and electromagnetic sensors measured posture of the wrists and shoulders, respectively. A force-sensing platform placed under the keyboard measured typing force. Whole body and upper extremity anthropometric measurements were recorded manually. RESULTS: Normalized muscle activity (EMG), the forces applied to the keyboard relative to the maximum force of the fingertip (%MVC), and range of motion were consistently higher for women. Shoulder posture was less neutral for women.

40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} offer distinct {{advantages for}} use in space that can address {{many of the issues}} encountered with current rigid-link space mechanisms. Compliant space mechanisms are defined as moveable mechanical assemblies that achieve their desired <b>motion,</b> <b>force,</b> or displacement by means of the deflection of flexible members and can perform a necessary function in the environments of launch and space. Many current space mechanisms are already highly optimized, yet they still experience inherent challenges, and it is unclear if significant improvements in performance can be made by continuing to refine current designs. Compliant space mechanisms offer a promising opportunity to change the fundamental approach to achieving controlled motion in space systems and have potential for dramatic increases in mechanism performance given the constraints of the space environment. This paper proposes the merger of the fields of compliant mechanisms and space mechanisms as a future direction of research in compliant mechanisms, discusses in detail the motivation to do so, and addresses the key factors of applying compliant mechanism technology to space mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{generalised}} structure groups and generalised holonomy groups {{has been introduced}} in supergravity, {{in order to discuss}} the spinor rotations generated by commutators of supercovariant derivatives when non-vanishing form fields are included, with their associated gamma-matrix structures that go beyond the usual Γ_MN of the Riemannian connection. In this paper we investigate the generalisations to the usual Riemannian structure and holonomy groups that result from the inclusion of higher-order string or M-theory corrections in the supercovariant derivative. Even in the absence of background form fields, these corrections introduce additional terms Γ_M_ 1 [...] . M_ 6 in the supercovariant connection, and hence they lead to enlarged structure and holonomy groups. In some cases, the corrected equations of <b>motion</b> <b>force</b> form fields to become non-zero too, which can further enlarge the groups.
