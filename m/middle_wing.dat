25|$|Armstrong Whitworth's chief designer, Frederick Koolhoven's first {{design to}} meet this requirement, {{probably}} designated F.K.5, was a large, single-engined tractor triplane with the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> having a much greater span than {{the upper and lower}} wings. The gunners were housed in two long nacelles mounted on top of the <b>middle</b> <b>wing,</b> allowing them to be seated ahead of the propeller disc, with the pilot's cockpit situated behind the wings in the slim central fuselage, giving a poor view. The undercarriage consisted of a sprung strut carrying two mainwheels underneath the engine, with two stabilsing wheels at the wingtips of the lower wing, with a tailskid just aft of the trailing edge of the lower wing. This design never flew, with the head of Armstrong Whitworth's Aircraft department, I. Fairbairn-Crawford, forbidding test flights.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{the three}} largest public {{rooms in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> were reopened, {{following}} partial restoration: the Semi-Circular Hall, the Portrait Hall and the Marble Drawing Room. However, despite {{the best efforts of}} curators, limited restoration funds, dispersed collections, and the absence of the palms and flowers – from now vanished imperial hothouses – that had once lushly decorated several of the rooms, meant that the presentations were somewhat sparse and of varying quality.|$|E
25|$|While {{of similar}} {{size and weight}} to the {{aircraft}} discussed in the press, the Model T had unequal span wings, with the upper wing having a span of 134feet, while it was planned to be powered by four tractor 250hp (187kW) Curtiss V-4 engines installed, unusually for the time, individually on the <b>middle</b> <b>wing.</b> The two pilots and flight engineer were provided with an enclosed cabin, similar to the America, while to reduce control loads, small windmills could {{be connected to the}} aileron cables by electrically operated clutches to act as a form of power assisted controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{final design}} had a {{wingspan}} of over 131 ft (40 m), {{with the central}} wing of much greater span than the other two. Four engines were mounted in push pull configuration pairs between the lower and <b>middle</b> <b>wings</b> {{with the other two}} mounted in tractor configuration between the <b>middle</b> and upper <b>wings,</b> directly above the lower pairs. The tractor engines used two-bladed propellors, the pushers four-bladed ones. With {{the end of the war}} conversion to a passenger aircraft was planned.|$|R
25|$|The Engineering Division {{was forced}} to use Liberty engines because of an {{abundant}} supply of the engines. To power the Barling, four 420hp Liberty engines were mounted between the lower and <b>middle</b> <b>wings</b> in a tractor arrangement, and an additional two in a pusher position. The gross weight of the bomber was 42,569lb. It had a fuel capacity of 2,000 gallons, and carried 181 gallons of oil.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21 mm. The forewings are yellowish-brown with extensive dark speckling. There is a blackish smudge near the <b>middle</b> of <b>wing,</b> bordered by a reddish-orange smudge below. A diffuse gray shade line runs diagonally from the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing</b> toward the inner margin, then bends sharply and runs diagonally toward the apex. The hindwings are uniformly brownish-gray.|$|R
25|$|The CF-10 {{was a large}} twin engined triplane {{originally}} powered with Curtiss OX-5 engines. The aircraft {{featured a}} conventional landing gear arrangement, with paired main wheels. The twin engines were mounted {{to either side of}} the fuselage between the middle and lower wings. The <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> did not have a full span, each wing only protruded from the engine nacelles outboard, leaving a gap next to the fuselage for visibility. The fuselage was octagonal in shape with a large windowed cabin, and a two-seat open cockpit placed high {{to the rear of the}} aircraft. One example, later known as the Pride of Los Angeles, was painted bright orange.|$|E
25|$|Rugby {{football}} {{was the first}} sport Conacher played, {{and it was his}} favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved to into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship.|$|E
25|$|The Fury's unstaggered wings {{comprised}} the 3-bay lower wings, mounted {{near to the}} top of the hull, and a pair of 4-bay upper wings of larger span; all were supported by pairs of vertical struts and diagonal cross-bracing. The original design specified three 600hp (447kW) Rolls Royce Condor engines, but these were not available and five 334hp (249kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VII engines were fitted instead. These were mounted on the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> and supported by additional struts, configured as two outboard tandem tractor/pusher (push-pull) pairs and one central pusher. In addition to its triplane configuration, the Fury had a biplane tailplane with a triple rudder, mounted on a single vertical fin similar to the Curtiss triplane. Not unlike the Model T the Fury was initially provided with servo-motors for the main flight control surfaces, designed by Major Arthur Quilton Cooper, but these were removed later without compromising the pilot's ability to control this large aircraft. At some point the engines were replaced with the more powerful 334hp (249kW) Eagle VIIIs.|$|E

500|$|On the {{far side}} of the Inner Court is the poorhouse, built on the site of the 12th-century Great Hall. The poorhouse forms three wings: the 17th century Red House to the south, the 18th-century <b>middle</b> <b>wing,</b> and the {{northern}} end which incorporates part of the original Great Hall; all of the building was subject to 19th-century renovation work. Five carved, medieval stone heads are set into the poorhouse, taken from the older medieval castle buildings. Next to the poorhouse is the Postern Gate, which leads to the Prison Tower. The Prison Tower, also called the Western Tower, is a significant defensive work, redesigned in the 16th century to feature much larger windows. In the middle of the Inner Court is the castle well, [...] deep.|$|E
2500|$|Koolhoven {{completely}} reworked {{the design}} {{to produce the}} F.K.6. While still a triplane with the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> of significantly greater span than {{the upper and lower}} wings, it was larger, with two-bay wings. [...] This time, the gunner's nacelles were slung under the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> and were shorter, so that the gunners sat behind and outboard the propeller (and less than 2ft (0.6m) from the exhaust manifold). The fuselage was much deeper than the F.K.5, filling the gap between the middle and lower wings, giving a slightly better view, while the undercarriage had two pairs of wheels with a narrow track under the fuselage and a more conventional tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The Possum was a single-bay triplane, {{with equal}} span, {{parallel}} chord wings without sweep or stagger. [...] The lowest wing joined the lower fuselage longerons and the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> the upper longerons, with the upper wing held {{well above the}} fuselage on cabane struts. [...] There were ailerons on all wings. [...] The propeller shafts were mounted in the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> within small fairings and placed {{as close to the}} fuselage as the two-bladed, 9ft 6 in (2.90 m) propellers would permit. [...] One advantage of the triplane layout was that each propeller shaft could be symmetrically braced with a pair of X-shaped struts to the upper and lower wings. [...] One set of Xs joined the forward spars and the other the rear. [...] The wing structure was fabric-covered wood.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are fuscous, mottled with light grey, ochreous and black scales. There is a blackish, indistinct band {{near the base}} and two black patches at the costa at one-third and two-thirds, {{as well as two}} black spots surrounded with ochreous scales in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing.</b> There are also three groups of raised ochreous scales in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing,</b> as well as a thin black line from the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing</b> into the apex. The hindwings are dark grey, lighter towards the base. Adults have been recorded on wing in July and August.|$|R

2500|$|The Osprey was of {{conventional}} wood and fabric construction, with single-bay triplane wings. [...] It was {{powered by a}} Bentley BR2 rotary engine, and featured the required armament of two Vickers machine guns and a single Lewis gun. The synchronised [...] Vickers guns were mounted ahead of the pilot, while the Lewis gun was mounted on a movable mounting on the centre section of the <b>middle</b> <b>wing,</b> where it had a very limited field of fire, with the large diameter propeller blocking any forward fire. Like a similar gun mounted on the Snipe it {{would probably have been}} deleted had the type gone into production.|$|E
2500|$|The unusual DDr.I {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{aircraft}} to have two engines on the same centre line, one in tractor configuration and the other a pusher, an arrangement usually known as tandem push-pull. [...] It was a triplane with constant chord, straight edged, square tipped wings of equal span and marked stagger. [...] These were divided into two bays by pairs of near-parallel interplane struts. [...] The upper wing was braced over the fuselage with a pair of N-form struts, leaning inward from the upper fuselage to common mountings on the wing centre line. [...] The <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> of the triplane was positioned at shoulder height on the fuselage and the lower wing passed unbraced below. There were short span ailerons on each wing.|$|E

2500|$|The unequal span triplane had the <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> {{mounted to}} {{the lower part of}} the main {{fuselage}} and booms, with the upper and lower wings supported by wire braced inter-plane struts. The centre section housed [...] a [...] Austro-Daimler V-12 water-cooled engine, driving a wooden two-bladed pusher propeller. The twin booms were constructed of modified Lloyd C.II fuselages with [...] Austro-Daimler 6 water-cooled in-line engines, and two bladed wooden propellers. [...] Directly below the main section between the middle and lower wings, was a fully enclosed compartment with windows for the bombardier. The most forward section between the middle and upper wings also had windows and enough space for two air gunners with excellent fields of fire in all directions and was also equipped with a spotlight. The pilots position was set in the rear of the centre fuselage close to the pusher propeller and had very poor forward visibility. Defensive armament consisted of two Schwarzlose M7/12 machine guns in the gunners station and one in each boom.|$|E
2500|$|Barling had {{previously}} designed the Tarrant Tabor, which was similar in concept but {{was destroyed in}} a fatal nose-over crash on its first flight in 1919. The nose-over had probably been caused by the high placement {{of two of the}} six engines – a compromise {{due to the lack of}} more powerful engines. Like the Tabor, the Barling Bomber was a large six-engined triplane with a cigar-shaped fuselage. Unlike its predecessor, the Barling had all of its engines mounted level with the fuselage. The aircraft used three wings, but was not actually a triplane. More correctly, it was a two-and-a-half wing aircraft. The <b>middle</b> <b>wing</b> had no control surfaces, and was shorter and narrower than the two primary wings. The top and bottom wings had a chord of , and each had a surface area of about [...] The stabilizer and elevator surfaces were [...] with an [...] chord. The fins and rudders looked like a box kite, and had a surface area of [...] The undercarriage consisted of 10 wheels, including two wheels mounted towards the front of the aircraft (to prevent a nose-over on takeoff) and a tail skid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} also wood; slab sided and plywood-covered. [...] From the side the nose was rectangular, {{but it was}} rounded in plan, rather {{like that of the}} Vickers Vimy. [...] The front gunner 's position was slightly back from the nose, with the pilot's cockpit just behind it and well in front of the wings. [...] A rear gunner's cockpit was placed at the trailing edge of the high set upper wing. [...] Both gunners' cockpits were fitted with Scarff rings. [...] The 450hp Napier Lion engine, a water-cooled unit with 12 cylinders in W or broad arrow arrangement was placed at the centre of gravity inside the fuselage, though with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] There was a radiator {{on each side of the}} fuselage near the trailing edge; unusually, these were hinged so that they could be adjusted in flight more or less directly into the slipstream as the pilot chose. [...] The Lion was mounted in line with the fuselage, with its output close to the leading edge of the <b>middle</b> <b>wing,</b> where a bevel gear transmitted the power via drive shafts to gears behind the propellers. [...] The propellers counter-rotated at low speeds.|$|E

These streaks terminate at about the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing,</b> except the last, which runs across the wing. There are six conspicuous tufts of raised black scales in two longitudinal rows on the <b>middle</b> of the <b>wing.</b> The dorsal part of the wing is pure white, the apical overlaid with ochreous and black scales. The interval between it and the last costal streak appears as a narrow angulated white fascia. The hindwings are light fuscous.|$|R
