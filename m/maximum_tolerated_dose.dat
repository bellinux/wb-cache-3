It is worth noticing however that, when comparing lenalidomide and pomalidomide, clinical relevance of higher in vitro potency is unclear since <b>maximum</b> <b>tolerated</b> <b>dose</b> of pomalidomide is 2mg daily compared to 25mg for lenalidomide, leading to 10-100 times lower plasma drug concentration of pomalidomide.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{trials are}} {{the study of}} {{treatments}} in humans. The first-in-human tests of a potential treatment are called Phase I studies. Early clinical trials typically enroll {{a very small number}} of patients, and the purpose is to identify major safety issues and the <b>maximum</b> <b>tolerated</b> <b>dose,</b> which is the highest dose that does not produce serious or fatal adverse effects. The dose given in these trials may be far too small to produce any useful effect. In most research, these early trials may involve healthy people, but cancer studies normally enroll only people with relatively severe forms of the disease in this stage of testing. On average, 95% of the participants in these early trials receive no benefit, but all are exposed to the risk of adverse effects. [...] Most participants show signs of optimism bias (the irrational belief that they will beat the odds).|$|E

Data are presented on 25 patients who contacted the epilepsy nurse specialist telephone helpline for advice after starting treatment with TPM. Thirteen male and 12 female patients, mean age 41 years (range 25 – 69 years), with localization-related epilepsy contacted the helplines, between November 1999 and March 2001, complaining of symptoms of antiepileptic drug intoxication after starting treatment with TPM. All were taking <b>maximum</b> <b>tolerated</b> <b>doses</b> of CBZ-MR before starting TPM. Sixteen {{of the patients}} were taking other antiepileptic drugs concomitantly with CBZ-MR and TPM. Symptoms of intoxication {{were similar to those}} previously experienced when <b>maximum</b> <b>tolerated</b> <b>doses</b> of CBZ-MR were exceeded. Symptoms resolved when concomitant CBZ-MR doses were reduced, enabling further dose escalation of TPM. To our knowledge, neither clinical nor pharmacological interactions between CBZ and TPM have been described previously in man. These data suggest that such an interaction may be of clinical importance, and that reduction of the CBZ dose may enable optimization of the dose of TPM, improving seizure control...|$|R
