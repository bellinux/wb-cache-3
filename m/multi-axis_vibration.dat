To realise such concepts, <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> test facilities are required. A hydraulic prototype test facility, primarily designed for research and development, is presented.

Using {{the method of}} magnitude estimation, 16 subjects estimated their discomfort caused by dual-axis and tri-axial motions (octave-bands centred on either 1 or 4 Â Hz with various magnitudes in the fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical directions) and the discomfort caused by single-axis motions. The method of predicting discomfort assumed in current standards (square-root of the sums of squares of the three components weighted according to their individual contributions to discomfort) provided reasonable predictions of the discomfort caused by <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration.</b> Improved predictions can be obtained for specific stimuli, but no single simple method will provide accurate predictions for all stimuli because {{the rate of growth}} of discomfort with increasing magnitude of vibration depends on the frequency and direction of vibration. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} model-based analysis of robust stability and performance for a <b>multi-axis</b> active <b>vibration</b> isolation system with constant but unknown payload and subject to modelling errors associated with structural flexibility. The theoretical treatment involves a linear time-invariant (LTI) system subject to real parameter uncertainty associated with the unknown payload. A set of performance indices are formulated based on generalized H 2 (Hg) and H∞ measures. A method for stability/performance verification is then developed using a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function that incorporates the kinetic energy of the uncertain payload mass. This allows nonconservative bounds on the performance indices to be established via numerical solution of a corresponding set of matrix inequalities. The approach is especially suitable, and computationally efficient, for multi-degree-of-freedom systems as the overall (symmetric positive-definite) properties of the system mass matrix are accounted for without involving information for each scalar parameter. The associated LMIs can therefore be solved in polynomial time {{with respect to the}} number of unknown parameters. Numerical examples for the case of sky-hook damping control and multiobjective Hg/H∞ control are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as a tool for model-based controller evaluation and multiobjective optimization...|$|R

Presented in this work are a set of experimental data comparing {{the rate of change}} of the first natural frequency and the measured time to failure, of simple structural members under repetitive shock (RS) vibration, single-axis electrodynamic (ED) <b>vibration</b> and <b>multi-axis</b> ED <b>vibration.</b> It was found that multi-axis testing is more severe than single-axis testing at the same level. In addition the RS system low frequency amplitude is often too weak to efficiently propagate the crack. Smoothing of the input power spectral density (PSD) or poor line resolution was also shown to change the time to failure of a test. A poor correlation was shown between the PSD and the rate of natural frequency change (RFC) over a wide frequency shift. The change in natural frequency caused the initial PSD to be ineffective in determining the total time to failure. A predictive, analytic methodology to quantify the RFC was developed to predict the fatigue life of a structure experiencing random vibration excitation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program is to develop the Drilling Vibration Monitoring & Control System (DVMCS) to both record and reduce {{drilling}} vibrations in a ''smart'' drill string. It is composed of two main elements. The first is a <b>multi-axis</b> active <b>vibration</b> damper to minimize harmful axial, lateral and torsional vibrations, and thereby increase both rate of penetration (ROP) and bit life, as well that the life of other drillstring components. The hydraulic impedance (hardness) of this damper will be continuously adjusted using unique technology that is robust, fast-acting and reliable. The second component is a real-time system to monitor 3 -axis drillstring vibration, and related parameters including weight- and torque-on-bit (TOB) and temperature. This monitor will determine the current vibration environment and adjust the damper accordingly. In some configurations, it may also send diagnostic information to the surface via real-time telemetry. Phase I of this program addresses {{an evaluation of the}} environment in which the DVMCS will operate; modeling of a drillstring response including the active damper; a top-level design of the mechanical and electronic systems; analyzing the anticipated performance of the damper by modeling and laboratory testing of small prototypes; and doing preliminary economic, market, environmental and financing analyses.

40|$|In this {{conclusion}} to a four-part series of papers, {{an interpretation of}} the experimental data presented in the earlier three papers is given. The results obtained from the experiments are compared with those obtained by other researchers. A set of simplified approximations to the various equivalent comfort contours are defined and a general approach to the prediction of discomfort due to <b>multi-axis,</b> multi-input complex <b>vibration</b> is given. It is shown that the results for translational vibration of a seat surface supporting the body are reasonably consistent with some previous studies. Although the contours for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration are in agreement with those in ISO 2631 (1978) there is evidence that sensitivity to vertical seat vibration above 8  Hz should be greater than defined in that standard. It is shown that the results for rotational seat vibration differ by an order of magnitude from those published by other authors but that this difference may be explained by the positions of the centres of rotation used in other studies. It is shown that simple approximations to the median equivalent comfort contours for translational and rotational seat vibration and translational foot and back vibration may be defined by contours on acceleration frequency graph having a slope of O dB per octave (constant acceleration) and 6 dB per octave (constant velocity). For most conditions these contours fall within the 25 th- 75 th percentile of the experimental data.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration to the occupant {{of a car}} seat has been studied using the multiple vibration inputs to the seat. Twelve input signals at the seat base (tri-axial vibration at the four corners) and six output signals (tri-axial vibration at the backrest and seat pan) were measured while driving. The results showed that vibration inputs to the seat varied between the four positions at the seat base. The two fore-aft input accelerations at the left-hand side of the seat base and the two fore-aft input accelerations at {{the right-hand side of}} the seat base were highly correlated with each other. There was also a high correlation between the two pairs of lateral acceleration inputs at the front and rear of the seat base. A computer program for studying seat vibration transmission via multi-input channels was developed to allow the calculation of seat transmissibility with up to 12 different inputs. The {{transmission of}} <b>multi-axis</b> seat base <b>vibration</b> to fore-aft seat backrest vibration was investigated using single-input, two-input, six-input and eight-input models. Results showed that the fore-aft vibration and the vertical vibration, but not lateral vibration, at the four corners of the seat base contributed to fore-aft vibration of the backrest. The primary peak of the fore-aft backrest transmissibility occurred around 4 – 5 Hz. The coherency was improved when using the multi-input models, although the characteristics of the transmissibility remained similar. The transmission of lateral vibration at the seat base to lateral vibration at the backrest was studied using single-input and two-input models. With single-input models, the transmission of lateral acceleration at the seat base to lateral acceleration at the backrest was amplified between 18 and 35 Hz, with a peak at 26 Hz. Coherency was greater at frequencies above 20 Hz than at lower frequencies. The coherency at low frequencies was increased with a two-input model. The transmission of vertical vibration to vertical vibration at the backrest was investigated using single-input, four-input and six-input models. The results showed that vertical acceleration at the four corners of the seat base was highly correlated with vertical acceleration at the backrest. The results are consistent with previous findings that a single-input model is not sufficient to study the transmission of vibration to the seat back in the horizontal directions, while for the transmission of vertical vibration a single-input model is probably sufficient, especially when low frequencies are of main concern...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} of dimensions and {{recent advances in}} the lightweight design of space systems {{have led to the}} requirement of new structural dynamic qualification techniques. The paper presents a new concept called the Modal Force Combination (MFC) technique. The method replaces the base accleration commonly applied during structural dynamic qualification by having a set of forces act directly in a selected number of structural points. The forces compensate for the d'Alembert inertia forces which arise due to transient multi-axial base acceleration. The transient forcing functions are calculated by means of modal deformations and related model force distributions in order to obtain the same structual responses of the structure as would occur with base accleration. The MFC method offers two possibilities of performing a simulation: the energy method and the deflection method. Both versions were investigated experimentally. The essentials of the verification tests are presented. The results of experimental dynamic load simulation by means of modal force combination are compared with measurements from base excitation performed on DLR's <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> simulator MAVIS in Göttingen, Germany.

40|$|Occupational on-road and {{off-road}} vehicle operators {{are exposed to}} low frequency whole-body vibration (WBV) of comprehensive magnitudes, and have shown a high prevalence of back disorders. Characterisation of seated body biodynamics response is considered vital for assessing potential injury risks of WBV and for developing effective biomechanical models for integration in the primary and secondary suspension design processes. The seated body biodynamic responses to single axis vibration have been investigated widely under vertical axis and a few under individual horizontal axis. The responses to simultaneous three-axis vibration, as encountered during vehicle driving, however, have been investigated in two recent studies. In this dissertation research, the biodynamic responses of seated body exposed to single as well as multiple axis vibration are characterised {{in terms of the}} apparent mass (APMS), vibration power absorbed (VPA) and seat-to-head vibration transmissibility (STHT) responses with both hands and back supports. The APMS responses are characterised considering two-driving-points formed by the buttocks-pan and upper-body backrest interfaces to fully describe the body-seat interactions. This study proposes a method to determine the total seated body APMS response from the forces measured at the two-driving points. Furthermore, it is shown that the commonly used frequency-response-function (H 1), would suppress the contributions of the cross-axis responses under uncorrelated simultaneous multi-axis excitations. Consequently an alternative frequency response estimator (Hv) is applied for analyses of responses to uncorrelated multi-axis. The results obtained, clearly revealed the contributions of cross-axis responses, which were not evident in the reported responses derived using H 1 function estimator. Further, it is shown that the total response along an axis can be estimated from super position of the direct and cross-axis response components along the same axis. The seat-to-head vibration (STHT) transmissibility responses are also obtained so as to obtain additional target functions for defining the biodynamic models. The STHT responses also revealed considerable coupling effects of <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration,</b> when Hv function estimator is applied. The total VPA of the body under multi-axis is further derived considering the power absorption attributed to cross-axis body responses. A methodology is proposed to derive frequency-weightings similar to those in ISO 2631 - 1 using the absorbed power responses. Thus derived weightings based on total responses of the seated body under multi-axis uncorrelated vibration, are proposed to better evaluate the vibration exposure risk due to the whole-body <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration.</b> The results of the study suggest that the frequency-weightings derived for the back supported postures differ substantially from the current standardised weighting. The current weighting is thus believed to be applicable only for back unsupported sitting conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} exposure {{has been found}} to negatively influence health, comfort and performance. Performance measures are affected by the task and situation investigated, so it is difficult to make detailed recommendations based on fundamental research. There is little knowledge on performance during {{vibration exposure}} combined with additional occupational hazards such as bent or twisted postures. In addition, little information is available on the effective use of armrests during performance related tasks. Many off-road machines have suspension seats with armrest-mounted controls, yet {{there is a lack of}} literature establishing if armrest support provides benefits for off-road machinery operators under combined environmental stressors. This paper reports a study investigating the influence of sitting in different working postures on the reaction time and perceived workload of subjects exposed to seated whole-body vibration. Twenty-one subjects were exposed to 1 - 20 Hz random <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration.</b> Posture combined with whole-body vibration exposure had a large influence on the ability to perform the task. The combined environmental stressors significantly degraded performance: not only did reaction times become compromised, the participants ’ workload also increased. The most severe decrement in performance and workload was experienced while seated in a twisted posture with no armrest support. It is concluded that armrest-mounted controls can reduce the workload and improve performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Increase of {{size and}} recent {{advances}} in lightweight design of space systems {{have led to the}} requirement of new approaches to structural dynamic testing techniques. The paper gives a brief survey of different qualification methods based on single-axis and multi-axis testing. A new concept called the modal force combination (MFC) method is proposed, in which the base excitation of a spacecraft due to various load events can be simulated by a set of forces acting directly in specially selected structural points. The forces compensate for the d'Alembert's inertia forces arising due to the transient multi-axial base accelration. The forcesare specially conditioned by a series expansion of so-called modal force distribution so that they produce the same deformations and accelerations in the structure as would occur by base excitation. Two versions of the MFC concept are presented in the paper. The first uses arbitrary orthogonal force vectors {{in the vicinity of the}} resonance frequencies, and the second is based on transfer functions. Initial experimental results are presented, taken from an applicationof the technique on a three-dimensional test structure. The results of experimental dynamic load simulation by means of modal force vectors are compared with measurements from base excitation performed on DLR's <b>multi-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> simulator MAVIS 2. In conclusion, the presented MFC versions are discussed...|$|E
