5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first <b>met</b> <b>as</b> a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E
5|$|Brenda Song {{was born}} in Carmichael, California, a suburb of Sacramento, to a Hmong family. Her {{paternal}} grandparents were from the Xiong clan, but changed their last name to Song when the family immigrated to the United States. Her parents were born in Thailand and <b>met</b> <b>as</b> adults in Sacramento. Her father works as a schoolteacher and her mother is a homemaker. She has two younger brothers, Timmy and Nathan.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be <b>met,</b> <b>as</b> low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root <b>met</b> <b>as</b> young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 {{and left}} to form Burnham & Root the {{following}} year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Simon Harwood, {{the officer}} who struck Tomlinson, was a police constable with the Territorial Support Group (TSG) at Larkhall Lane police station in Lambeth, South London. Harwood had faced 10 {{complaints}} in 12 years, nine {{of which had been}} dismissed or unproven. The complaint that was upheld involved unlawful access to the Police National Computer. The complaints included a road-rage incident in or around 1998 while he was on sick leave, during which he reportedly tried to arrest the other driver, who alleged that Harwood had used unnecessary force. On Friday, 14 September 2001, before the case was heard by a discipline board, Harwood retired on medical grounds. Three days later, on Monday, 17 September, he rejoined the <b>Met</b> <b>as</b> a civilian computer worker.|$|E

5|$|Stratton then {{obtained}} an A.M. {{degree from}} Yale in 1890. He {{was a fellow}} in the philosophy department at Berkeley from 1891 to 1893. The chair of the philosophy department, George Holmes Howison, whom he <b>met</b> <b>as</b> an undergraduate, would become a significant influence on his life. He taught two philosophy courses, both with Howison. On March 14, 1893 he was appointed an instructor {{in the department of}} philosophy. As an instructor, he began teaching psychology and logic courses, in addition to a philosophy course.|$|E
5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he <b>met</b> <b>as</b> a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E
5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was {{influenced}} by the non-black Jews he <b>met</b> <b>as</b> well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.|$|E

5000|$|Murphy, {{despite his}} long {{association}} with the Mets, never openly rooted for the team from the booth. Listeners {{knew that he was}} happier when the <b>Mets</b> won, <b>as</b> evidenced by his mention of a [...] "happy recap" [...] after a Mets win and a [...] "recap" [...] after a Mets loss, but he never referred to the <b>Mets</b> <b>as</b> [...] "we" [...] and, reflecting his love of the game, he would sound equally excited when a good play was made against the <b>Mets</b> <b>as</b> he would when the Mets made a similar play.|$|R
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily <b>met.</b> <b>As</b> rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{first team}} have competed {{in a number}} of nationally contested leagues, and their record against each club faced in those {{competitions}} is summarised below. The opening match of the 1889–90 Football Alliance season pitted them against near neighbours Birmingham St George's, their first Football League match was against Burslem Port Vale, and they met their 109th and most recent different league opponent, Burton Albion, {{for the first time in}} the 2016–17 Football League season. The team that Birmingham have played most in league competition is Manchester City, whom they first <b>met</b> <b>as</b> Ardwick in the 1891–92 Football Alliance season; they and Wolverhampton Wanderers have both beaten Birmingham 60 times, though Wolves took fewer matches to do so, with 127 compared to City's 134. Everton have drawn 35 league encounters with Birmingham, more than any other club. Birmingham have recorded more league victories against Leicester City than against any other club, having beaten them 50 times out of 124 attempts.|$|E
5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, whom he <b>met</b> <b>as</b> a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but {{he enjoyed the}} script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike The Wizard of Oz, which he would not bother remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2005, Cotto {{faced the}} last man to beat him as an amateur, former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Mohamed Abdulaev from Uzbekistan. As amateurs, Abdulaev eliminated Cotto from {{the first round of}} the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This time they <b>met</b> <b>as</b> professionals in New York City's Madison Square Garden. Before the beginning of the fight Cotto received a positive ovation from the public. During the first round Miguel went on the offensive scoring hits on Abdullaev's head and body while he was in a defensive stance. In the fourth round a left hook by Miguel hurt Abdullaev, who proceeded to focus his hits on Cotto's body. Abdullaev's offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev's eye was swollen to the point of being almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight's referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev's eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, the District and the Met saw {{increased}} competition in central London from the new electric deep-level tube lines. With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Electrification had been considered by the <b>Met</b> <b>as</b> early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E
