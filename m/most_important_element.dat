5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon {{cannot be}} captured, the player can use {{different kinds of}} Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the strength of}} the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E
5|$|While Roman and Celtic Christianity {{were very}} similar in {{doctrine}} and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there were differences in practice. The most contentious were the method of calculating Easter, and the form of head shaving for priests known as tonsure. Other differences were in the rites of ordination and baptism, and {{in the form of}} service of the liturgy. In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of clerical celibacy, intense secularisation of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a diocesan structure. This made abbots (or coarbs), rather than bishops, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> the church hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over {{the course of his}} career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E

25|$|Having reconstructed his government, Asquith {{attempted}} a re-configuration of his war-making apparatus.

25|$|Taylor's set lists largely include {{songs from}} the Great American Songbook and his own compositions. His {{arrangements}} and compositions are often influenced by composers like Nelson Riddle and Duke Ellington and, as such, include many moving lines {{to fill in the}} spaces, e.g., walking basslines, syncopated chordal 'stabs' (to emulate horn sections), and complex jazz harmony. All this is achieved without compromising the melody, which he considers the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> in any arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Battles of the Middle Ages in Poland - not {{counting}} such battles as Battle of Legnica, Battle of Grunwald, Battle of Varna or the last Battle of Orsha - were not large fights, {{and most of}} them can be called skirmishes rather than battles. However, the Crimean Tartars and the Turks simultaneously attacked Polish-Lithuanian frontier, at one time reaching Lublin. To fight successfully this new enemy, light (or semi-light, like husaria) cavalry became the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of the Polish army.|$|E
25|$|Each field {{artillery}} regiment was originally organised as two batteries, each of two troops of six guns. This was changed late in 1940 to three batteries each of eight guns. Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of a battery was the Forward Observation Officer (FOO), who directed fire. Unlike most armies of the period, in which artillery observers could only request fire support, a British Army FOO (who was supposedly a Captain but {{could even be}} a subaltern) could demand it, not merely from his own battery, but from the full regiment, or even the entire {{field artillery}} of a division if required. The artillery's organisation became very flexible and effective at rapidly providing and switching fire.|$|E

25|$|In Titov's {{music the}} text is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element,</b> as it defines both the overall form and {{the shape of the}} melodic lines, {{sometimes}} resulting in accomplished word-painting. The musical language is largely tonal; melodic lines are treated individually in horizontal manner, with many motivic ornaments. Titov's textures in his large-scale works suggest that these pieces were meant not to separate the choirs in alteration, but to unite them, so there is no direct connection to the antiphonal style of the Western Baroque. A characteristic feature is the so-called variantnost (вариантность), the linking of melodic motifs by continuous subtle alterations which is also an important element in Russian chant and folk polyphonic traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{developers}} of the Holywood Exchange {{were able to}} take advantage of existing road connections. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of these connections was a full flyover on the A2, already built for access to the Belfast Harbour Estate. The Belfast-Bangor railway line runs between the site and the A2. There are proposals for a railway halt to serve both Holywood Exchange and the adjacent Belfast City Airport. However Belfast City Airport argues that constructing the halt adjacent to the airport terminal (further away from Holywood Exchange) would encourage more air travellers to use the rail connection. The Airport has also stated that it will consider providing road access to the airport through Holywood Exchange as a way of reducing congestion on the existing airport access route.|$|E
25|$|After carbon, {{nitrogen}} {{is arguably}} the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required {{to address the question}} of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} photos tends to {{outweigh}} their quality {{when it comes}} to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.|$|E
25|$|The role of yeast in {{winemaking}} is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> {{that distinguishes}} {{wine from grape}} juice. In the , yeast converts the sugars of wine grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide {{through the process of}} fermentation. The more sugars in the grapes, the higher the potential alcohol level of the wine if the yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation to dryness. Sometimes winemakers will stop fermentation early in order to leave some residual sugars and sweetness in the wine such as with dessert wines. This can be achieved by dropping fermentation temperatures {{to the point where the}} yeast are inactive, sterile filtering the wine to remove the yeast or fortification with brandy to kill off the yeast cells. If fermentation is unintentionally stopped, such as when the yeasts become exhausted of available nutrients, and the wine has not yet reached dryness this is considered a stuck fermentation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>element</b> of this Part was the {{extension}} of rights of audience in the higher courts to solicitors and other legal professionals. Sections 27 and 28 of Part II give an advocate rights of audience {{and the right to}} conduct litigation if the advocate is qualified to do so, is a member of a professional body recognised by the Lord Chancellor and that body considers him qualified to conduct litigation. A person also has rights of audience if they have been directly granted it, for example by the Lord Chancellor in County Court proceedings. The most immediate effect of this is that solicitors can now gain rights of audience in the Crown Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, Court of Session, Privy Council, and House of Lords if they qualify as Solicitor Advocates. Solicitor's clerks also have rights of audience in the chambers of judges in the Crown Court and High Court, assuming they are being instructed by a qualified solicitor.|$|E
