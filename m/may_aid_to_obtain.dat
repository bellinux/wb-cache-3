40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} the fourth leading cause of cancer-related {{mortality}} in the United States. The minority of patients can undergo curative-intended surgical therapy due to progressive disease stage at time of diagnosis. Nonetheless, tumor involvement of surgical margins is seen in up to 70 % of resections, being a strong negative prognostic factor. Real-time intraoperative imaging modalities <b>may</b> <b>aid</b> surgeons <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> tumor-free resection margins. Full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) is a promising diagnostic tool using high-resolution white-light interference microscopy without tissue processing. Therefore, we composed an atlas of FF-OCT images of malignant and benign pancreatic tissue, and investigated the accuracy with which the pathologists could distinguish these. One hundred FF-OCT images were collected from specimens of 29 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for various indications between 2014 and 2016. One experienced gastrointestinal pathologist and one pathologist in training scored independently the FF-OCT images as malignant or benign blinded to the final pathology conclusion. Results were compared <b>to</b> those <b>obtained</b> with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Overall, combined test characteristics of both pathologists showed a sensitivity of 72 %, specificity of 74 %, positive predictive value of 69 %, negative predictive value of 79 % and an overall accuracy of 73 %. In the subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, 97 % of the FF-OCT images (n = 35) were interpreted as tumor {{by at least one}} pathologist. Moreover, normal pancreatic tissue was recognised in all cases by at least one pathologist. However, atrophy and fibrosis, serous cystadenoma and neuroendocrine tumors were more often wrongly scored, in 63 %, 100 % and 25 % respectively. FF-OCT could distinguish normal pancreatic tissue from pathologic pancreatic tissue in both processed as non-processed specimens using architectural features. The accuracy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is promising and warrants further evaluation using improved assessment criteria...|$|R

We address this interplay by tracking Brownian Dynamics trajectories of particles in a binary colloid of opposite charges in an external electric field, undergoing cross-over from homogeneous to lane state, a prototype of heterogeneous structure formation in non-equilibrium systems. We show that the length scale of structural correlations controls heterogeneity in diffusion and consequent anomalous dynamic responses, like the exponential tail in probability distributions of particle displacements and stretched exponential structural relaxation. We generalise our observations using equations for steady state density which <b>may</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> understand microscopic basis of heterogeneous diffusion in condensed matter systems...|$|R

40|$|Food borne viruses such as {{norovirus}} and hepatitis A virus {{are increasingly}} recognized worldwide {{as the most}} important cause of food borne gastro-intestinal illness. Food borne outbreaks, often involving multiples cases, have been reported and associated with food products of both animal and non-animal origin. Most foods are contaminated with food borne viruses during preparation and service. However, bivalve molluscs and occasionally produce (in particular leafy vegetables and soft red fruits) may be contaminated during production and processing. Owing to the low infectious dose of these viruses, the presence of few viral particles on the food is often sufficient for an infection. Over the past decade, molecular methods - such as RT-(q) PCR - have therefore been developed for rapid detection of viral contamination on foods. The availability of these detection methods has led to an increased detection of viral contamination in foods. However, RT-(q) PCR and other molecular methods detect the mere presence of an RNA (or DNA) fragment and are unable to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viral particles in the monitoring of food products for viral contamination which makes interpretation of these results not straightforward. The current review aims to summarize recent efforts made for a more correct interpretation of these positive RT-(q) PCR results. First of all, RT-(q) PCR test results should be analyzed taking into account the results of various appropriate controls in place to assure well-functioning of good laboratory practices. Subsequently, approaches that <b>may</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> facilitate acceptation and that <b>may</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> put RT-(q) PCR positive food products into context from a public health perspective are discussed. These approaches include (1) the use of a critical acceptance limit, (2) the confirmation of positive RT-(q) PCR results and (3) the potential correlation with faecal indicators. Finally, the current review provides insights in a selection of methods currently under development that may be able to facilitate the specific detection of infectious food borne viruses...|$|R
