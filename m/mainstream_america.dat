5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and lower classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the popular jazz and swing music listened to by <b>mainstream</b> <b>America,</b> {{there were a number}} of other genres that were popular among certain groups of people—e.g., minorities or rural audiences. Beginning in the 1920s and accelerating greatly in the 1940s, the blues began rapidly diversifying into a broad spectrum of new styles. These included an uptempo, energetic style called rhythm and blues (R), a merger of blues and Anglo-Celtic song called country music and the fusion of hymns and spirituals with blues structures called gospel music. Later than these other styles, in the 1940s, a blues, R and country fusion eventually called rock and roll developed, eventually coming to dominate American popular by the beginning of the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{title is}} a pun on {{high school and}} college {{football}} team anthems known as fight songs as the song is partly a post-Columbine statement disparaging <b>mainstream</b> <b>America's</b> own glorification of violence among its youth; football is simultaneously one of the most violent sports and one of America's greatest obsessions.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{segregated}} {{conditions and}} widespread poverty, some black {{neighborhoods in the}} United States have been called [...] "the ghetto" [...] or [...] "the projects." [...] The use of this term is controversial and, depending on the context, potentially offensive. Despite <b>mainstream</b> <b>America’s</b> {{use of the term}} [...] "ghetto" [...] to signify a poor urban area (predominately African-Americans), those living in the area often used it to signify something positive.|$|R

5|$|Blues {{became a}} part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record {{companies}} launched the field of race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta blues musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont blues musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm & blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson. The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, {{as well as in the}} 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country blues musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas.|$|E
25|$|Multiple piercings {{in one or}} {{both ears}} first emerged in <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> in the 1970s. Initially, the trend was for women to wear {{a second set of}} {{earrings}} in the earlobes, or for men to double-pierce a single earlobe. Asymmetric styles with more and more piercings became popular, eventually leading to the cartilage piercing trend.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Denomie lived on {{reservation}} {{until the age of}} four when his family moved to Chicago, Illinois due to forced government relocation programs taking place within Native communities in the 1960s. This program, started by Dillon S. Myer, head of Bureau of Indian Affairs, hoped to assimilate American Indians into <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> by providing job and housing opportunities in major cities for selected families and individuals.|$|E
50|$|The American Council On Renewable Energy (ACORE) is a member-based, {{non-profit}} organization, {{founded in}} 2001 {{to bring together}} leading proponents and innovators from all facets of the renewable energy sector {{for the purpose of}} moving renewable energy into the <b>mainstream</b> of <b>America's</b> economy.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{segregated}} {{conditions and}} widespread poverty some African-American {{neighborhoods in the}} United States have been called [...] "ghettos". The use of this term is controversial and, depending on the context, potentially offensive. Despite <b>mainstream</b> <b>America's</b> {{use of the term}} [...] "ghetto" [...] to signify a poor urban area populated by ethnic minorities, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The African-American ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African Americans, the ghetto was [...] "home", a place representing authentic [...] "blackness" [...] and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from the rising above the struggle and suffering of being of African descent in America.|$|R
40|$|Black {{nationalism}} {{responded to}} America's failure {{to examine the}} effects of slavery's legacy. Its aims represent those issues that were either unsupported by or in opposition to the goals of the civil rights leadership. In particular, the civil rights movement dismissed any claims that the history of slavery had a lasting effect on African-Americans. This conflict developed because of <b>mainstream</b> <b>America's</b> inability to realize that the black community is not monolithic and African-Americans were differentially affected by slavery's legacy. It is those blacks who are most affected by the culture of poverty created by America's history of slavery who make up today's inner-city populations. Despite successes by the civil rights movement, problems within lower-class black communities continue because the issues of the black underclass have not yet been fully addressed...|$|R
25|$|Zitkála-Šá was {{an active}} member of the Society of American Indians, which {{published}} the American Indian Magazine. From 1918 to 1919 she served as editor for the magazine, as well as contributing numerous articles. These were her most explicitly political writings, covering topics such as the contribution of Native Americans to World War I, land allotment, and corruption within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency within the Department of Interior that oversaw American Indians. Many of her political writings have since been criticized for favoring assimilation. She called for recognition of Native American culture and traditions, while also advocating US citizenship rights to bring Native Americans into <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> She believed this was how they could gain political power.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A. Wallace's {{bid for the}} President of the United States, {{during which}} Robeson {{traveled}} to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him. In the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas to work because his concert performances were canceled at the FBI's behest. While on tour, he spoke at the World Peace Council, at which his speech was publicly reported as equating America with a Fascist state—a depiction that he flatly denied. Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to him was a catalyst for his becoming an enemy of <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> Robeson refused to bow to public criticism when he advocated in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin J. Davis Jr., charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.|$|E
2500|$|When Redding died {{suddenly}} in 1967, Walden, his brother, and Frank Fenter founded Capricorn Records in Macon, the label that {{was responsible for}} bringing The Allman Brothers Band and Southern rock into <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> [...] During his stint with Capricorn, Walden signed blues rock singer and guitarist Boz Scaggs.|$|E
5000|$|East Asians {{have been}} portrayed as immature, childlike, {{and not to}} be taken seriously. As John Cho says, [...] "there's this belief that Asian babies are really cute, and it got me {{thinking}} that our whole race is infantilized to some degree, and it manifests itself in different ways. You infantilize a woman, and she becomes eroticized. You infantilize a man, and he becomes emasculated. You infantilize a baby—and it's possible, it appears that you can infantilize a baby even more. The babies need to be cuter than white babies. And it's just a weird thing that I felt like said something about <b>mainstream</b> <b>America's</b> relationship to Asians in general."This infantilization results in Asians having less social autonomy. They are often perceived as polite and quiet, and less threatening than people of other races. Because Asians are seen like children, the perception is that they have little power, access, and control.|$|R
5000|$|Despite <b>mainstream</b> <b>America's</b> use of {{the term}} [...] "ghetto" [...] to signify a poor, {{culturally}} or racially homogenous urban area, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The black ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African Americans, the ghetto was [...] "home": a place representing authentic blackness and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from rising above the struggle and suffering of being black in America. Langston Hughes relays in the [...] "Negro Ghetto" [...] (1931) and [...] "The Heart of Harlem" [...] (1945): [...] "The buildings in Harlem are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem's much more than these alone,/Harlem is what's inside." [...] Playwright August Wilson used the term [...] "ghetto" [...] in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (1984) and Fences (1987), both of which draw upon the author's experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, a black ghetto.|$|R
5000|$|In Captain America vol. 4, #28 (August 2004), an Isaiah Bradley from an {{alternative}} Earth became Captain America and never married. Later, he is elected president and serves two terms.

2500|$|The 1980s {{began with}} new wave {{dominating}} the charts, and continued {{through a new}} form of silky smooth soul, and ended with a popular glam metal trend dominating <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> [...] Meanwhile, the first glimmer of punk rock's popularity began, and new alternative rock and hardcore found niche markets. [...] Hip hop diversified as a few artists gained mainstream success, finally breaking through {{in the last few months}} of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Esther Wells (May 13, 1943 – July 26, 1992) was an American {{singer who}} helped {{to define the}} {{emerging}} sound of Motown in the early 1960s.

2500|$|Harry Smith was a West Coast filmmaker, bohemian, and eccentric, who, around 1940, {{developed}} a hobby of collecting old blues, jazz, country, Cajun, and gospel records, 78s {{being the only}} medium at the time. [...] While <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> often considered these records to be ephemeral, he took them seriously and accumulated a collection of several thousand recordings, and over time began to develop an interest in seeing them preserved and curated.|$|E
5000|$|Whites {{are about}} 33 percent of Cleveland's population. Most live in {{areas in the}} West side of Cleveland, with areas further away from {{downtown}} and close to Lakewood and Parma being near exclusively white.

5000|$|The Sugarhill Gang's debut single [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] {{has been}} said to popularize rap music and bring the genre into <b>mainstream</b> music in <b>America.</b> Rappin' Down Town was the third album the group recorded.|$|R
2500|$|During the 19th century, {{it was not}} spirituals that gained truly {{widespread}} acclaim, {{but rather}} peppy comic songs performed by minstrels in blackface, and written by legendary songwriters like Stephen Foster and Daniel Emmett. [...] During the Civil War, popular ballads were common, some used liberally by both the North and the South as patriotic songs. [...] Finally, late in the century, the African American cakewalk evolved into ragtime, which became a North American and European sensation, while <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> was enthralled by the brass band marches of John Philips Sousa.|$|E
2500|$|The preface quotes Samuel Johnson: [...] "He {{who makes}} a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." [...] The {{quotation}} alludes to the protagonists' profuse drug use in escaping the coarse realities of American life; passages detail the failed counterculture, people who thought drug use was the answer to society's problems. The contradiction of [...] "solace in excess" [...] is thematically similar to The Great Gatsby, while the travelogue of counter-cultural protagonists struggling with conservative <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> draws comparisons to On the Road; both were favorite novels of Thompson's.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his early}} career (80s and early 90s), Hammer would tour, perform and record with his hype man 2 Bigg MC or Too Big (releasing {{a song in}} which he claimed [...] "He's the King of the Hype"). This duo {{introduced}} the [...] "shiny suit" [...] (and popularized Hammer pants) to <b>mainstream</b> <b>America,</b> as seen in videos such as [...] "(Hammer Hammer) They Put Me In A Mix", in which Hammer also claimed Too Big was the [...] "King of Hype", who was in an unspoken competition with Flavor Flav (hype man for Public Enemy) {{during the height of}} their careers.|$|E

50|$|The author's son, Leonard T. Miller, {{encouraged}} {{his father}} to write his motor racing memoirs in 1995, after concluding a sponsorship presentation to a Fortune 500 corporation.

2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance {{he looked a}} little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times he had a big afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> got a good look at Wolfman Jack.|$|E
2500|$|Early hip hop [...] {{may have}} reduced inner-city gang {{violence}} by replacing physical violence with hip hop battles of breakdancing, turntablism, rapping and artwork. However, {{with the emergence}} of commercial and crime-related gangsta rap during the early 1990s, violence, drugs, weapons, and misogyny, were key themes. Socially and politically conscious hip hop has long been disregarded by <b>mainstream</b> <b>America</b> in favor of its media-baiting sibling, gangsta rap. Alternative hip hop artists attempt to reflect the original elements of the culture. Artists/groups such as Lupe Fiasco, Immortal Technique, Lowkey, Brother Ali, Public Enemy, The Roots, Shing02, Jay Electronica, Nas, Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Dilated Peoples, Dead Prez, Blackalicious, Jurassic 5, Jeru the Damaja, Kendrick Lamar, Gangstarr, KRS-One, Living Legends emphasize messages of verbal skill, internal/external conflicts, life lessons, unity, social issues, or activism.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of Our Southern Highlanders {{typically}} {{revolves around}} Kephart's focus on backwoods outlaws or {{people living in}} extreme poverty while paying scant attention to the region's middle class landowners and town dwellers, many of whom {{would not have been}} too far out of place in <b>mainstream</b> <b>America.</b> [...] Historian John Puckett wrote that Our Southern Highlanders [...] "projected a jaundiced view of the region" [...] in which the mountaineers were portrayed as [...] "'half-wild' creatures." [...] Kephart scholar Gary Carden has argued that while Kephart was an excellent observer, he had a tendency to [...] "romanticize" [...] the mountaineers' more offensive qualities. Hazel Creek historian (and native) Duane Oliver recalled that Our Southern Highlanders [...] "angered" [...] many Hazel Creek residents for {{the manner in which it}} portrayed them, but argues that, as a writer, it was natural that Kephart would seek out the region's more colorful personalities.|$|E
