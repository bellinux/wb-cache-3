25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate <b>membrane</b> <b>tank.</b> One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
5000|$|All {{wastewater}} {{generated in}} the building is treated and recycled for use in toilet and urinal flushing, as well as green roof irrigation. The treatment facility uses a membrane bioreactor process, manufactured and supplied by GE/Zenon, consisting of two bioreactor tanks and an ultrafiltration (hollow fibre) <b>membrane</b> <b>tank,</b> followed by chlorination to remove colour and disinfect the reclaimed water. The treatment system is designed for an average daily flow of 75 cubic metres per day (20,000 gpd), and maximum flows of up to 150 cubic metres per day (40,000 gpd). With the City of Vancouver 2012 commercial metered water and sewer rates at $2.803 and $1.754, respectively, the convention centre can save over $21,000 per month in utility fees through water reuse. One of the biggest operating challenges is to maintain the treatment plant bacteria in a healthy condition during lengthy periods (e.g. late December through mid-January) of no or limited convention activity and concurrent wastewater generation within the building.|$|E
40|$|The major limitation, which hinders {{the wider}} {{application}} of membrane technology {{and increases the}} operating costs of membranes involved in wastewater treatment plants, is membrane fouling induced by organic matter. Extracellular polymeric products (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP) {{are the two most}} mentioned major foulants in publications, for which the debate on precise definitions seems to be endless. Therefore, a concept of sludge water, which conceptually covers both EPS and SMP, has been developed in this research. A standard procedure of sludge water separation, which is centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min followed by 1. 2 μm glass fiber filter filtration, was established based on separation experiments with <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> sludge from the KAUST MBR wastewater treatment plant. Afterwards, sludge waters from the KAUST MBR WWTP anoxic tank, aerobic tank and <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> as well as sludge waters from the Jeddah WWTP anoxic tank, aerobic tank and secondary effluent were produced through the previously developed standard procedure. The obtained sludge water samples were thereafter characterized with TOC/COD, LC-­‐OCD and F-­‐EEM, which showed that KAUST anoxic/ aerobic /membrane tank sludge waters had similar characteristics for all investigated parameters, yet the influent naturally had a higher DOC and biopolymer concentration. Moreover, lower TOC/COD, negligible biopolymers and low levels of humics were found in KAUST effluent. Compared with the KAUST MBR WWTP, the Jeddah WWTP’s sludge waters generally had higher DOC and biopolymer concentrations. To investigate sludge water fouling potential, the KAUST <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> sludge water as well as the Jeddah secondary effluent were filtrated through a membrane array consisting of an ultrafiltration (UF) Millipore RC 10 kDa at the first step followed by a nanofiltration (NF) KOCH Acid/Base stable NF 200 at the second step. It was found that cake layer and standard blocking occurred simultaneously during both of these filtration processes. For the KAUST MBR <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> sludge water and the Jeddah WWTP effluent, the fouling potential of humic/building blocks was much higher than that of biopolymers. Compared with the KAUST MBR <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> sludge water, the Jeddah WWTP effluent had comparable biopolymer fouling potential and higher humic/building blocks fouling potential...|$|E

50|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{the use of the}} two {{different}} membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic <b>membrane</b> <b>tanks</b> utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the Suez Canal. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.|$|R

The software Gambit and Fluent are used to generate the mesh and simulate the LNG sloshing motion. The LNG sloshing behaviour is analysed considering a two-dimensional <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> which moved in one direction only for each case studies. Two cases of the tank motions are considered, i. e., sway and roll. The LNG tank is excited by a regular sinusoidal wave and the excitation frequency is set as the natural frequency. Liquid filling levels considered are 25 %, 50 % and 75 % of the tank depth,respectively. Moreover, the numerical results of the impact pressure are compared with the published experimental results and show good agreement. Furthermore, a vertical baffle is inserted {{on the bottom of}} the tank to control the maximum impact pressure and results are compared with non-baffle cases. The key findings are: the effect of liquid depth on the maximum impact pressure for rotational motion is more significant comparing with the horizontal motion and offer solutions for reducing impact pressure effectively.

Effective pretreatment is required to mitigate membrane fouling and in this paper we have evaluated the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculation with alum coagulation. Bench scale tests were conducted over extended periods with two types of PAM (different molecular weights (MW)) applied with, and without alum coagulation, in order to investigate their impact on membrane fouling. The structure of the resulting flocs formed in the process and the activity of bacteria within the <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> were identified as two key factors influencing UF system performance. It was found that development of the cake layer and hydraulic resistance of the membrane were influenced by the floc properties, which were in turn related to the MW and dose of the PAM. Coagulation and flocculation using the larger MW PAM formed amorphous flocs with a lower fractal dimension, which contributed to a lower density of the cake layer and lower rate of increase in trans-membrane pressure. PAM flocculation without alum coagulation induced severe membrane fouling by forming a continuous gel-like layer on the membrane surface. By alum-PAM dosing {{it was found that the}} concentration of bacteria present in the <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> and adhering to the cake layer, was sufficient to remove nearly all of the ammonia and around 80 % phosphorus in the raw water.

40|$|In 2001 Japan {{imported}} 54. {{1 million}} tons of LNG, which was slightly {{over half of the}} world’s total LNG production of 100 million tons per year. About 60 % of Japan’s LNG is stored in aboveground tanks and the rest is stored in-ground tanks at LNG regasification terminals in Japan. In-ground tanks have excellent merits; high safety, effective land utilization and not disrupting scenery. On the other hand, in 1993, pre-stressed concrete (PC) was used {{for the first time in}} Japan to construct a new aboveground LNG storage tank. Currently almost all aboveground tanks in Japan are single containment, with structurally independent dikes. At present five PC tanks, with this new design, are in operation in Japan, and some are under construction or in the planning stage. In Europe and the United States aboveground PC tanks have been constructed since 1960 s and was the common tank design of the 1980 s. Presented here is a Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) of LNG aboveground tank designs based on the past operating records of LNG regasification terminals, along with a conventional single containment tank design. The assessment was conducted after choosing two aboveground tank designs, among several, to study. One is the PC <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> without a structurally independent dike. It has a high, calculated safety probability. This design, however, has not been constructed anywhere in the world. The other is a Steel/PC double shell tank without a structurally independent dike.

The membrane modules were placed in a separate compartment, continuously aerated. This configuration allowed to disconnect from the filtration stage the biological phenomena occurring into the IA bioreactor. The observed results highlighted good efficiencies, in terms of organic carbon and ammonium removal. It was noticed a significant soluble microbial products (SMPs) release, likely related to the higher metabolic stress that anoxic conditions exerted on the biomass.

40|$|Abstract The {{occurrence}} of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP), an acidic fraction of polysaccharides, was monitored {{for more than}} six months in the activated sludge of three MBR units and the relationship between TEP and other fouling indicators was studied. These compounds consist mainly of exopolysaccharides of a sticky nature, a characteristic which makes them a group of interesting substances in processes like sedimentation, flocculation and membrane fouling. The relationship between capillary suction time (CST) and polysaccharides (PS) was linear for the three tested sludges, although the correlation with TEP concentrations was stronger. A slight linear correlation of both TEP and PS was found with the critical flux (CF) measured with a small filtration test cell, which was submerged in the <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> to assess the filterability performance of the sludge in situ.

Furthermore, few full-scale and long-term experiments have been published, and their results do not always match with the models developed from lab-scale studies. A statistical approach linking long-term and short-term permeability evolution with operational variables in full-scale membrane bioreactors for domestic waste-water treatment is presented.

Permeability and several fouling indicators were calculated {{in each of the four}} hollow-fibre <b>membrane</b> <b>tanks</b> of the plant. The influence of SRT, temperature, MLSS, F:M ratio, iron dosing and membrane flux on daily permeability evolutions, instantaneous permeability evolution and hydraulic backwash efficiency was studied. In order to minimise the bias due to correlations between input variables, a statistical approach using principal component regression and partial least-square regression was tested. Flux, temperature, SRT and F:M ratio are the most influential input variables on long-term permeability evolutions. Iron dose and MLSS are less correlated with fouling indicators. The proposed approach may be improved by integrating the history of the membrane to better describe and predict the permeability evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Pre-treatment is {{normally}} required {{to reduce or}} control the fouling of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes in drinking water treatment process. Current pre-treatment methods, such as coagulation, are only partially effective to prevent long-term fouling. Since biological activities are {{a major contributor to}} accumulated fouling, the application of an oxidation/disinfection step can be an effective complement to coagulation. In this study, a novel pre-treatment method has been evaluated at laboratory scale consisting of the addition of low dose ozone into the UF <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> after coagulation and the use of a hollow-fibre membrane coated with/without MnO 2 nanoparticles over a test period of 70 days. The results showed that there was minimal fouling of the MnO 2 coated membrane (0. 5 [*]kPa for 70 days), while the uncoated membrane experienced both reversible and irreversible fouling. The difference was attributed to the greatly reduced presence of bacteria and organic matter because of the catalytic decomposition of ozone to hydroxyl radicals and increase of the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface.

40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the <b>membrane</b> <b>tanks</b> in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the <b>membrane</b> <b>tanks</b> to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the <b>membrane</b> <b>tanks.</b> Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.

Finite element analyses are presented using a model representing parts of an LNG <b>membrane</b> <b>tank.</b> The objective was to find and quantify the dynamic amplification factor (DAF) for the structural response towards sloshing impact pressures. The influence of variations in the load characteristics such as load duration, extent of the loaded area, load location as well as the influence of the insulation system was evaluated. The study shows that the response in the studied region of the hull structure experiences significant levels of dynamic amplification during impact loads with specific durations. The response sensitivity analysis also shows that the insulation system (MARK III type) has a large effect on the dynamic behaviour of the hull structure. It has been found to alter the magnitude of the stress and deflection response for key structural members.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{metal membrane}} system for removing contaminants from rainwater. The system consists of submerged metal <b>membranes</b> in a <b>tank</b> and an aerator or an ozone generator. Contaminated rainwater is {{introduced into the}} tank after an initial screening of solids and permeate is removed after passing through the membrane. Ozone bubbling as well as aeration in the feed side were applied to reduce membrane fouling, destruct organic pollutants, and inactivate microorganisms. The metal membrane appears to be suitable {{to be used with}} ozonation because of its excellent chemical stability. Experiments were performed to compare filtration characteristics of rainwater in storage tank, roof runoff, and roof garden runoff and to investigate the effect of ozone injection on the increase in transmembrane pressure and membrane fouling...|$|R
40|$|A {{dialysis}} {{membrane reactor}} {{can be used}} for enzymatically catalyzed conversions of low-molecular substrates / 1 /. The principle of the reactor is based on the physical separation of substrate and enzyme by a semi-permeable membrane. Substrate as well as product can pass through this barrier by diffusion while the enzyme is retained by the <b>membrane.</b> With the <b>tanks</b> in series model it is possible to describe enzymatically catalyzed processes in the dialysis membrane reactor. For the hydrolysis of lactose by ß-galctosidase from Kluyv. lactis and fragilis the calculations with the tanks in series model show good agreement with experiments. With an excess amount of ß-galactosidase, i. e. at least approx. 100 IU enzyme per milliliter enzyme solution volume the reactor was operated in a diffusion-limited way. The limiting factor with respect ot the conversion achievable is the diffusion rate of the lactose through the membrane...|$|R
40|$|A {{major cause}} of {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) membrane fouling is the accumulation of microorganisms and their associated soluble products. To mitigate fouling the application of pulsed short-wavelength ultraviolet (UVC) light (around 254  nm) within the <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> together with pre-coagulation was investigated. In mini-pilot-scale tests carried out in parallel with conventional pre-treatment (CUF), the impact of pulsed UV (CUF-UV) at different UV irradiances and fluxes on the increase of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) was evaluated and {{explained in terms of}} the quantity and nature of membrane deposits in the membrane cake layer and pores. The results indicated that at a flux of 20  L m(- 2)  h(- 1), the pulsed UV (1  min within 31  min cycle) at 3. 17  ×  10 (- 2)  W/cm(2) prevented any measureable increase in TMP over a period of 32 days, while there was a fourfold increase in TMP for the conventional pre-treatment. For the CUF-UV system the concentration of bacteria and soluble microbial products was much less than the conventional CUF system, and the cake layer was thinner and contained less biopolymers (proteins and polysaccharides). In addition, the pores of the CUF-UV membrane appeared to have less organic deposits, and particularly fractions with a high molecular weight (> 10  kDa). At a lower UV irradiance (1. 08  ×  10 (- 2)  W/cm(2)), or higher flux (40  L m(- 2)  h(- 1)) with the same UV irradiance, there was a measurable increase in TMP, indicating some fouling of the CUF-UV membrane, but the rate of TMP development was significantly lower (∼ 50 %) than the conventional CUF membrane system. Overall, the results show the potential advantages of applying intermittent (pulsed) UVC irradiation with coagulation to control UF membrane fouling...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{vaporizing}} flow of {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) through porous or penetrable media has received very little attention despite its importance in assessing the performance and risk-based safety of large <b>membrane</b> <b>tank</b> LNG ships under barrier leakages. In this work, a fluid flow model is proposed and used to analyse the vaporizing flow behaviour of LNG through soil and glass wool porous materials. Furthermore, a modified vaporizing liquid pool model is implemented and {{used to examine the}} problem of vaporizing LNG pool on non-penetrable solid substrates. We employed an explicit, finite difference and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithms coded in FORTRAN to respectively solve the flow and pool models. Both models were successfully verified and validated by comparisons to experimental data, analytical solutions, and to predictions of a commercial software (TOUGH 2). Results from the vaporizing flow and pool analyses demonstrate that, for some of the applications considered, the liquid is expected to reach considered threshold depths, seep through the porous layer and contact, contaminate and/or embrittle surrounding natural or engineered systems. For the specific application to LNG cargo containment systems (or cargo tanks), this work has shown that there are safety risks associated with LNG leakage, which are ultra-low temperature of the inner hull, cryogenic damage and subsequent failure of the cargo containment system. Thus, for any LNG membrane cargo containment system to continue to be safe and secure, the various structural members of the insulation system should be designed and equipped with new and improved materials that possesses the necessary mechanical and thermophysical properties to maintain and/or improve the critical temperature standard and low-temperature performance of these systems. Further work should consider additional experimental evidence in order to fully validate and establish that solution predictions by the proposed models are describing the actual physical effects.

40|$|The growing {{environmental}} awareness during {{recent years has}} led to {{a significant increase in the}} use of natural gas as a green energy supply. This, in turn, has increased the demand for transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and therefore LNG carriers are growing in both size and numbers. This master’s thesis deals with a challenging design issue for LNG carriers with membrane type cargo tanks; the determination of structural response due to sloshing impact loads. These loads are characterized by very short durations and are thus likely to inflict a dynamic amplification in the response of the hull. This thesis covers a study consisting of FE analyses performed on a model representing parts of an LNG <b>membrane</b> <b>tank.</b> The main objective was to find and quantify the dynamic amplification factor (DAF) for the structural response towards sloshing impact pressures. The influence of variations in the load characteristics such as load duration, extent of the loaded area, load location as well as the influence of the insulation system was evaluated. The analyses were performed using an explicit calculation scheme in the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The study shows that the response in the studied region of the hull structure experiences significant levels of dynamic amplification during impact loads with specific durations. This has been found especially pronounced for certain load locations due to their excitation of structural members in the inner deck structure. The outcome of the response sensitivity analysis also shows that the insulation system (MARK III type) used for containing the cargo has a large effect on the dynamic behaviour of the hull structure. It has been found to alter the magnitude of the stress and deflection response for key structural members. It also changes the load time durations for which the maximum dynamic amplification occurs and increases the magnitude of the corresponding response DAF. It has been found that dynamic response, such as torsional deflection modes of the stiffeners and amplification effects from the insulation system, gives DAF values of up to 2. The effects have been found to be present for temporal load characteristics commonly occurring in sloshing model tests and full-scale measurements and are therefore likely to occur for a vessel in operation...|$|E

(2013) {{described}} an efficient transformation of DCF by immobilized laccase of Coriolopsis gallica {{in a continuous}} stirred <b>tank</b> <b>membrane</b> reactor, though the reactor volume was only 50  ml (flow rate: 40  ml/h). Thus, 70 % of the DCF was transformed within 80  h (initial concentration: 10  µM, laccase activity approximately 1 U/ml, McIlvaine buffer pH 5). Nguyen et al.

Within 132  h 85 % BPA and 60 % DCF was continuously transformed (initial concentration 500  µg/l d, laccase activity approximately 90  µM/min, Milli-Q-water). A further experiment with the same laccase and a mixture of BPA, DCF with 28 other pharmaceutics such as naproxen or ibuprofen was described by Asif et al. (2017 b). In the enzymatic reactor approximately 88 % BPA and 45 % DCF were transformed (initial concentration: 20  µg/l, laccase activity approximately 95 – 100  µM/min, Milli-Q-water).|$|R
40|$|A stirred <b>tank</b> <b>membrane</b> reactor is used {{to study}} the {{kinetics}} of polygalacturonic acid (PGA) enzymatic hydrolysis. The reactor operates in semicontinuous configuration: the native biopolymer is loaded at the initial time and the system is continuously fed with the buffer. The effect of retention time (from 10 1 to 142 min) and membrane molecular weight cutoff (from I to 30 kDa) on the rate of permeable oligomers production is investigated. Reaction products are clustered in two different classes, those sized below the membrane cutoff and those above. The reducing power measured in the permeate is used as an estimate of total product concentration. The characteristic breakdown times range from 40 to 100 min. The overall kinetics obeys a first-order law with a characteristic time estimated to 24 min. New mathematical data handling are developed and illustrated using the experimental data obtained. Finally, {{the body of the}} experimental results suggests useful indications (reactor productivity, breakdown induction period) for implementing the bioprocess at the industrial scale...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{new type}} of LNG tank named “KC- 1 {{membrane}} LNG tank” has been developed by Korean Gas Corporation (KOGAS), and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) is currently building KC- 1 membrane type LNG carriers. Unlike other LNG tanks, the KC- 1 <b>membrane</b> LNG <b>tank</b> has a single-insulation structure rather than a double-insulation structure. For a given tank’s boundary condition, heat transfer analysis is performed from the external to the internal environment of the LNG tank by numerical simulation for three tanks. In each tank, the main thermally resistant layer of insulation is assembled with a High density rigid Polyurethane Foam (H-PUF), which is blown with one of three different types of hydrofluorocarbons-namely-HFC- 365 mfc, 245 fa, and 245 fa-e (enhanced). Advantage of such blowing agents is that it has a lower Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) than HCFC- 141 b or carbon dioxide (CO 2) that has been used in the past as well as having low thermal conductivity. A Reduced Order Model is utilized to a 3 -dimensional section of the insulation to calculate equivalent thermal conductivity. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the insulation is then applied to the rest of LNG tank, reducing the size of tank simulation domain as well as computation time. Tank’s two external and internal boundary conditions used are those defined by the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) conditions. Boil-off Rate (BOR) of the tank that has the insulation with H-PUF blown with HFC- 245 fa resulted in 0. 0927 %/day and 0. 0745 %/day for IGC and USCG conditions, respectively...|$|R
