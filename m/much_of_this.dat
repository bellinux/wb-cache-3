Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
