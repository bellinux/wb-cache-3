The company's assets were sold for alleged unpaid taxes and it was declared bankrupt. PwC's audits were the foundation for the firm's defense in a series of continuing trials against former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and the former majority shareholder, Platon Lebedev. The Russian authorities then went after PwC. In March, 2007 police raided PwC's <b>Moscow</b> offices, confiscating <b>documents</b> related to Yukos and charging and convicting PwC of failing to pay 243 million rubles, or $9.4 million, in taxes.

50|$|The {{information}} about Flor Terentyev is extremely scarce. We {{know that he}} cast his bells for Moscow, Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Rostov cathedrals between {{the last quarter of}} the 17th century and early 18th century. The <b>Moscow</b> Cannon Yard <b>documents</b> do not mention Terentyev’s name, therefore, most researchers believe that he worked on orders from private individuals. Only one of his bells - the Sysoy - survived to this day. In the late 1680s, Metropolitan Jonah Sysoyevich of Rostov and Yaroslavl invited Flor Terentyev to work on his premises. In 1689, Terentyev cast a 2000-pood (33 Mg) bell named Sysoy for the bell tower of the Assumption Cathedral in Rostov. It is the biggest bell in the famous trio of Rostov bells.|$|R

We can only cautiously assume that Kashpir Ganusov {{was one of those}} craftsmen who had left the Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{in the first half of}} the 16th century. According to the <b>Moscow</b> Cannon Yard <b>documents</b> and archives, Kashpir Ganusov was working at the court of Ivan the Terrible in 1550s. In 1554, the cannon yard produced a huge bell weighing 19,657 kg, which would later receive the name of Lebed’ (Лебедь, or [...] "swan"). This bell didn’t survive to this day, but we only know of one bell maker in Moscow of that time, who could have cast it. Based on this, Kashpir Ganusov is considered the maker of this bell (or his predecessor, whose name is unknown).|$|R

Under {{the auspices of}} this program, Reactor Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute” (RRC-KI) has implemented a Neutron Flux Correction Methodology in Version 1. 2. 2 of the RELAP 5 - 3 D code. The implementation was done on the RINSC workstation in <b>Moscow,</b> and is <b>documented</b> in Reference 1. Because access to the RELAP 5 - 3 D source coding by RRC-KI was limited to only the subroutines needed for the interface to the flux correction subroutine, the implementation was done using local variable arrays. The input detector data were accessed by the subroutine via local data files, residing on the computer disc storage. INEEL was then tasked with providing a permanent installation in the current release of the code.

In 1935, Sorge passed on to <b>Moscow</b> a planning <b>document</b> provided to him by Ozaki, which strongly suggested that Japan was not planning on attacking the Soviet Union in 1936. Sorge guessed correctly that Japan would invade China in July 1937, and there was no danger of a Japanese invasion of Siberia. Sorge lived in a house in a respectable neighborhood in Tokyo, where he was mostly noted for his heavy drinking and his reckless way of riding his motorcycle. In the summer of 1936, a waitress at a bar frequented by Sorge named Hanako Ishii moved into Sorge's house to become his common-law wife. An American reporter who knew Sorge later wrote that he [...] "created the impression of being a playboy, almost a wastrel, the very antithesis of a keen and dangerous spy." ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{civil engineering}} in retrospect. The paper presents {{the records of}} the two contracts that date back to 1837 and 1838. The contracts cover the two stages of construction of a famous church in Vozdvizhenskoe Village in the <b>Moscow</b> Province. These <b>documents</b> were stored in the Central Historic Archive, namely, {{in the collection of the}} town hall of Sergievskij Possad. These records of the two agreements in the collection of the brokers notes (or in other books of the same type) are of particular value, as the majority of authentic contracts have been lost. One of the contracts covers the organizational procedure and pre-construction works, while the other one covers the construction of the church. The first document gives the idea of environmental protection, employment of ecological technologies, and safe disposal and recycling of human biowaste in the course of dismantling of an old structure in Vozdvizhenskoe village. The second document that dates back to 1838 covers the sequence of construction works, starting from the foundation and ending with the arches, the types of building materials used, and peculiarities of stone masonry. The information recorded in the contract includes the names of the counterparties, day-to-day mode of life of seasonal workers, remuneration of labour and procedures that assure the quality of construction. This agreement makes it possible to outline the construction process that includes workers, bricklayers, the foreman, the contractor, the architect, and the customer. On the whole, both documents help us outline and assess some of the building practices of the 19 th century. This issue is relevant nowadays, as our society has entered the phase of the market economy, while the experience accumulated by the past generations is of undeniable value...|$|R

In 1999, she moved to Brooklyn, New York and began {{performing and}} recording as AwRY, gathering a supporting group of musicians playing everything from wine glasses to wind chimes, and eventually added a string quartet after studying and collaborating with Australian composer Padma Newsome. She released an eponymous album, which was largely a reworking of songs from Word and {{is often referred to as}} The Orange Album; Quiet B-Sides in 2001, as well as a remix album in 2003. Shara Worden contributed xylophone, keyboard and backing vocals to the CD Recession Special of Bogs Visionary Orchestra in 2003. After meeting fellow transplanted Michigander Sufjan Stevens, she became one of his Illinoisemakers and took a hiatus from her own work to perform on his Illinois tour as cheerleading captain. When the tour was over, Worden renamed her project My Brightest Diamond and set to work on two albums: A Thousand Shark's Teeth, a collection of songs performed with a string quartet, and Bring Me the Workhorse, a more rock-oriented set that was released on Stevens' Asthmatic Kitty in summer 2006. My Brightest Diamond toured with Stevens that fall in support of the album. In 2006 she did a Take-Away Show video session with Vincent Moon.

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} study {{deals with}} an unusual German-Russian cultural encounter: a group of strolling German artists who crossed the border of Russia {{in the summer of}} the year 1644, on an extensive tour that had brought them to the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and the Baltic littoral (Reval and Dorpat). In Pleskau/Pskov, in the northwest part of the Muscovite state, they asked for permission to stay for some time, apparently in order to entertain the inhabitants and earn some money. Our primary focus is on a broadside – an advertisement for a group of tightrope walkers, illustrated with a copper etching – that has survived in the Russian State Archives of Ancient <b>Documents</b> (RGADA) in <b>Moscow.</b> The anonymous and undated broadside provides a great deal of indirect information about the performers, both through its large hand-coloured copper illustration and a detailed explanatory text in German. Thanks {{to the fact that we}} also found some additional documents, kept at the same archive – albeit not together with the advertisement – that we could link together with the broadside, we were in the lucky situation of being able to identify the strolling troupe and date the broadside to the year 1644 or a few years earlier. The principal of the troupe, Simon Dannenfels, was born in Strassburg in 1594; the other performers were his own children and three additional acrobats, mentioned by name in the Russian documents although we were not able to identify them further. In the article, Dannenfels’ life as a strolling artist is described on the basis of both published research and primary archival documents, above all from Strassburg, Stockholm, and <b>Moscow.</b> The Russian <b>documents</b> show that the German troupe was not welcome in Muscovy. As soon as the letter by the Pskov authorities, asking for advice on handling these foreigners, had been delivered to the tsar, the Russian court ordered that the comedians should be expelled from Muscovite territory. The documents do not tell us whether the troupe had any opportunities to show their artistic talents during the time it took for the Pskov authorities’ letter to be sent to Moscow and the tsar's answer to be sent back to Pskov (about one month). Although foreign artists had been employed at the tsars’ courts prior to Dannenfels, the Strassburg-born artist and his troupe were the first for whom we can show that they came to the country on their own initiative, without any invitation by the Russian authorities whatsoever. The article is relevant not only for the field of German and Russian cultural history, but also for the study of art history and more particularly the history of printed broadsides that were used as advertisements for artistic programmes. The ‘Moscow’ broadside is in all likelihood not only a unique copy of the Dannenfels troupe's advertisement, but possibly also the oldest dated (or dateable) broadside with a copper etching from the German-speaking territories that advertises an artistic performance.   English title in Web of Science: Strassburg Maskers in Pskov in 1644 : A German Strolling Troupe Seeks Its Fortune in the Tsar's Russia</p...|$|R
