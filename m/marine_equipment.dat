This service was discontinued in 2013 when a dock in Quincy was severely damaged. Currently, {{there are no plans}} to revive this service. The yard is also used by Jay Cashman, Inc., for heavy construction and <b>marine</b> <b>equipment</b> services, by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as a sewage sludge heat-drying and pelletizing facility, and by Fore River Transportation Corporation for short line freight rail service to CSXT South Braintree. The yard has also been used as the main construction area for the new Fore River Bridge, which is located adjacent to the property.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{a system for}} the analysis of the fault diagnosis of <b>marine</b> <b>equipments</b> in inland rivers. Since the normal operation of the <b>marine</b> <b>equipments</b> significantly influences the ship safety, this study develops an efficient fault diagnosis information system for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of <b>marine</b> <b>equipments.</b> In this new system, field bus and ship-to-shore communication technologies have been integrated for the fault diagnosis information acquisition. Then the application of network bus, including CAN and RS 485, has been employed to connect the fault diagnosis information with Ethernet in the ship. Lastly, for the real time and wireless transmission of the fault information, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology has been adopted to provide accurate and reliable fault diagnosis information transmission from ships to onshore diagnosis center. A comprehensive study of the application of proposed fault diagnosis information system has been implemented for remote diagnosis of <b>marine</b> <b>equipments.</b> The analysis results demonstrate that the newly developed fault diagnosis information system can enhance the fault diagnosis precision and hence is competent for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of <b>marine</b> <b>equipments</b> in inland rivers...|$|R

Sevmash has also delivered platforms for foreign companies, such as the marine semi-submerged MOSS CS-50 platform for the Norwegian Moss Mosvold Platforms AS company, which was finished in February 2006. Sevmash has received orders for 3 further platforms of this type. Sevmash is also building a platform for the mid-Barents Sea Shtokman gas field.|$|E
25|$|As sales progressed, Honda created {{two more}} sales channels, called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold {{products}} that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, {{such as the}} Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, <b>marine</b> <b>equipment,</b> plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans.|$|E

2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology.

The skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex, as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|E
