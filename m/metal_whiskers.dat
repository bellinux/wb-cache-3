50|$|Metal whiskering is a {{phenomenon}} which occurs in electrical devices. Tin whiskers were noticed and documented in the vacuum tube era of electronics early in the 20th century, in equipment which used pure, or almost pure, tin solder in their production. It was noticed that small metal hairs or tendrils grew between metal solder pads causing short circuits. <b>Metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> form {{in the presence of}} compressive stress. Zinc, cadmium, and even lead whiskers have been documented. Many techniques are used to mitigate the problem including changes to the annealing process (heating and cooling), addition of elements like copper and nickel, and the inclusion of conformal coatings. Traditionally, lead was added to slow down whisker growth in tin-based solders.|$|E
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} in {{electronics}} selection to ensure the devices can tolerate the radiation present.

Spacecraft in a sustained low Earth orbit lasting months or years are at risk and only fly hardware designed for and tested in irradiated environments. Missions beyond low Earth orbit or which would remain in low Earth orbit for many years must use radiation-hardened devices. Further considerations are made for operation in high vacuum due to the effects of sublimation, outgassing, and <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers,</b> which may result in mission failure.|$|E

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> often grow across leads of {{electric}} equipment and electronic package causing current leakage or short circuits and raising significant reliability issues. The nature of <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> {{remains a mystery}} after several decades of research. In addition, <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> exhibit a rather unusual dynamic property of relatively high amplitude movements under gentle air flow or, according to some testimonies, without obvious stimuli. Understanding the physics behind that motion would give additional insights {{into the nature of}} <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers.</b> Here, we quantitatively analyze several possible mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed movements: (1) minute air currents, (2) Brownian motion due to random bombardments with the air molecules, (3) mechanically caused movements, such as (a) externally transmitted vibrations of the sample, and (b) torque exerted due to material propagation along curved whiskers responsible for the whisker growth (similar to the known garden hose oscillations), (4) time dependent electric fields due to diffusion of ions across the metal surface, and (5) nonequilibrium electric field configurations making it possible for some whiskers to move. For all these scenarios we provide numerical estimates. Our conclusion is that the observed movements are likely due to the minor air currents, intentional or ill-controlled, and that external mechanical vibrations could force such movements in a rather harsh environment or/and for whiskers with severe constrictions. We argue that under non-steady state conditions, such as caused by changes in the external light intensity, some whiskers can exercise spontaneous oscillations. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|For years, {{the alloy}} {{of choice for}} {{electroplating}} electronic components has been tin-lead (Sn-Pb) alloy. However, the legislation established in Europe on July 1, 2006, required significant lead (Pb) content reductions from electronic hardware due to its toxic nature. A popular alternative for coating electronic components is pure tin (Sn). However, pure tin has the tendency to spontaneously grow electrically conductive Sn whisker during storage. Sn whisker is usually a pure single crystal tin with filament or hair-like structures grown directly from the electroplated surfaces. Sn whisker is highly conductive, and can cause short circuits in electronic components, {{which is a very}} significant reliability problem. The damages caused by Sn whisker growth are reported in very critical applications such as aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and military weapons systems. They are also naturally very strong and are believed to grow from compressive stresses developed in the Sn coating during deposition or over time. The new directive, even though environmentally friendly, has placed all lead-free electronic devices at risk because of whisker growth in pure tin. Additionally, interest has occurred about studying the nature of other <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> such as zinc (Zn) whiskers and comparing their behavior to that of Sn whiskers. Zn whiskers can be found in flooring of data centers which can get inside electronic systems during equipment reorganization and movement and can also cause systems failure.

40|$|Lithium {{dendrites}} are needle-like {{structures that}} form during the electrodeposition of lithium <b>metal.</b> These <b>whiskers</b> complicate {{the use of}} lithium metal as an anode in lithium batteries because they can puncture the separator and short circuit the battery. In addition, the large surface area and poor adhesion of the deposit contributes to loss of coulombic efficiency. The effect of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions on the morphology of electrodeposited lithium metal has been studied. Varying concentrations of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions were added to a 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) trimethylbutylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (N 1114 -TFSI) electrolyte. Lithium metal was electrodeposited from each electrolyte and examined ex-situ by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Alkali metal ions, {{with the exception of}} sodium, had little or no effect on the deposited lithium morphology. However, alkaline earth metal ions at 0. 05 M concentration significantly reduced the occurrence of dendrites. When the concentration of the alkaline earth metal ions was increased to 0. 1 M, dendrites were completely eliminated and lithium was deposited in a sphere-like morphology. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed that no alkaline earth metals were found in the sphere-like deposits, suggesting that dendrite mitigation occurred through an adsorption mechanism. © The Author(s) 2014.

40|$|Though it is {{generally}} known that whisker often springs from tin, the tin plated film on nickel does not provide the tin whisker growth under high temperature storage. But under thermal shock stress tin whisker grows even if the nickel film is formed under tin plated film. Then we have investigated the trend of growth and reliability evaluation about the tin whisker under thermal shock stress. As a result, we confirmed that the tin whisker under thermal shock stress did not cause short-circuit failure in field. Key words: tin whisker, thermal shock stress, lead-free. 1. troduction With the promotion of lead-free solder in these years, the conversion of solder-plating technology of electronics components from current methods to pure Sn or Sn-system plating is widely pursued. It {{is generally}} said that Sn is a <b>metal</b> easily generating <b>whiskers</b> in high temperature atmosphere, and each concerned manufacturer, etc. has made research about this type whickers 1).

However, it has been lately found that, if a thermal stress shock is charged on a product with Sn plate on Ni under-plate, it generates lint-like deposition products (i. e. we call them “whiskers ”) 3). As these whiskers have lint-like sinuous shape, some of which grow to few score micrometers, there is a concern that they may cause short-circuit failure between electrodes on electronics components. Therefore, we have performed stress analyses in order to investigate, in what conditions, these whiskers generated under the thermal shock stress grow and how they affect product reliability, and estimated the reliability level of electronics components used in the market environment in respect of the whisker generation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the influences of different operating conditions on the hydrogen formation and properties of accumulated carbon from methane decomposition using zeolite Y supported 15 and 30 Ni, respectively, at a temperature range between 500 and 650 degrees C in a pilot scale fixed bed reactor. The temperature ramp was showed a significant impact on the thermo-catalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane. An optimum temperature range of 550 - 600 degrees C were required to attain the maximum amount of methane conversion and revealed that at 550 and 600 degrees C, catalyst showed longer activity for the whole studied of experimental runs. Additionally, at 550 degrees C, the methane decomposition is two times longer for 30 Ni/Y zeolite than that for 15 Ni/Y zeolite catalyst, whereas it is almost three times higher at 500 degrees C. A maximum carbon yield of 614. 25 and 157. 54 g(c) /g(Ni) were reported after end of the complete reaction at 600 degrees C with 30 and 15 Ni/Y zeolite catalyst, respectively. From BET, TPD, and XRD analysis, we had reported that how the chemistry between the TCD of methane and metal content of the catalysts could significantly affect the hydrogen production as well as carbon nano-fibers. TEM analysis ensured that the produced carbon had fishbone type structures with a hollow core and grew from crystallites of Ni anchored on the external surface of the catalysts and irrespective of the <b>metal</b> loadings, the <b>whisker</b> types of nano filaments were formed as confirmed from FESEM analysis. Nevertheless, the effect of volume hourly space velocity (VHSV) on the methane conversion was also investigated and reported that the methane conversion increased as VHSV and nickel concentration in Ni-Y catalysts increased. Additionally, the initial methane decomposition rate increases with VHSV and it has reverse and non-linear relevancy to the weight of Ni/Y zeolite catalyst. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to address such questions we performed an in-depth study of MW structure at the nanoscale by detaching a MW from its original film, reducing its size to a thin slice by cutting its sides by a focused ion beam, and performing TEM on that structure. Our observations revealed a rich nontrivial morphology suggesting that MW may consist of many side by side grown filaments. This structure appears to extend to the outside whisker surface and be the reason for the striation. In addition, we put forward a theory where nucleation of multiple thin metal needles results into micron-scale and larger MW diameters.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the global {{transition}} to lead (Pb) -free electronics, pure tin and high tin lead-free alloys have been widely adopted by the electronics part manufacturers as the materials of terminal finishes. However, electrically conductive tin whiskers have been found to develop in pure tin or high tin alloy finished surfaces, resulting in a reliability concern. Experimental results and observation appear to support the hypothesis that the driving forces for whisker formation is compressive stress. However, no accepted model and accelerated factors are available to describe and predict whisker growth. Though the issue of <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers</b> has been studied for over 60 years, currently there is no an industry-wide accepted methodology to quantify tin whisker risk. In this dissertation, a tin whisker risk assessment algorithm, which mainly focuses on bridging risk, is developed. The goal of this risk assessment algorithm is to provide a practical methodology for the electronics industry to quantify the failure risks posed by tin whiskers on tin-plated electronic products. This algorithm assessES tin whisker bridging risk quantitatively as a function of time. Probabilistic and statistical methods are applied to quantify the risk parameters, such as whisker density and length, related to assess tin whisker risk. Monte Carlo technique is the basic tool to sample the whiskers and assess the bridging risk. Two experiments are designed and conducted to simulate bridging failures caused by fixed and broken free whiskers. The methods to collect the information of the risk parameters are demonstrated.

40|$|Electric arcs pose an {{ignition}} hazard {{in the presence}} of flammable gas mixtures. Electrical equipment to be used in such hazardous environments shall therefore satisfy strict safety requirements, through the use of internationally standardized explosion protection methods as e. g. "Intrinsic Safety", documented in the IEC 60079 - 11 Standard. This "Intrinsic Safety" is verified by using a stochastic empirical procedure, using a "Spark Test Apparatus" connected to an electrical energy source. The apparatus generates electrical discharges between a separating tungsten anode and a cadmium cathode enclosed in a test cell filled with flammable gas atmosphere. The connected electrical circuit is considered intrinsically safe if no ignition results within a defined number of contacts. However this procedure suffers from variability and poor reproducibility. The goal of this work is to investigate the relationships between such arc discharges and the ignition of the gas. The measurement is technically challenging, as the physical processes occur in different time scales (ns, μs, ms) and the physical dimensions are small (μm). Additionally the ignition process can also damage the experimental equipment. An important prerequisite for such discharges is a sufficient degree of electrode surface wear. Microscope images show such electrode surfaces as well as the presence of <b>metal</b> <b>whiskers.</b> These inhomogeneous rough surfaces are compared by the means of Abbott curves. A spectral analysis of the radiation from the electrical discharge shows, that the main substance is cadmium vapour. The electrical characteristics of these arcs are characterised by voltage, current and length curves. For constant currents from 74 to 270 mA up to a voltage of 40 V, the transient arc lengths, voltages and currents were measured for arc discharges generated in a 21 % Hydrogen-Air gas mixture. These initial results appear to correspond qualitatively to published curves for static arcs, however the accuracy of the measurements has to be improved. Knowledge of these relationships between electrical, mechanical and ignition processes will ultimately make it possible to recognize discharges which most likely cause an ignition by their current and voltage waveforms. This will allow the development of a more reliable alternative, where discharges are electronically simulated...|$|E
