5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and <b>mortar</b> <b>carrier,</b> allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized <b>mortar</b> <b>carrier</b> based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E

50|$|The M1129 {{is used in}} the US Army Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, {{where it}} is part of each Brigade's {{maneuver}} infantry battalion's and RSTA squadron's MTOE (Modified Table of Equipment). The vehicles are either organically subordinated to battalion level or company level. The battalion level vehicles are armed with the RMS6L 120MM mortar system, which is the vehicle mounted version of the RMS6L 120MM mortar. Additionally, they carry the 81mm M252 mortar that can only be used in a dismounted capacity. The company level vehicles also carry a vehicle-mounted 120mm mortar, which is augmented by the 60mm M224 mortar for dismounted use. The RSTA squadron only receives the 120mm mounted mortar, there is no augmentation dismounted maneuvers. Each Stryker infantry battalion thus has a total number of 10 <b>mortar</b> <b>carriers,</b> all of which are equipped with the 120mm system. Each Stryker RSTA battalion has a total of 6 <b>mortar</b> <b>carriers,</b> all of which are also equipped with the 120mm system.|$|R
