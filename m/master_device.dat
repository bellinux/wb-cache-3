They convey {{the contents of the}} link-state database (LSDB) for the area from one router to another. Communicating a large LSDB may require several messages to be sent by having the sending device designated as a <b>master</b> <b>device</b> and sending messages in sequence, with the slave (recipient of the LSDB information) responding with acknowledgements.|$|E
40|$|Most {{processor}} based communication designs have {{a central}} processor core {{as well as}} other <b>master</b> <b>devices,</b> possibly within the same chip. The <b>master</b> <b>devices</b> typically provide a “low touch ” method for the actual data transfer into or out of the communication system (DMA controller, MAC, etc.). However, if a system has multiple <b>master</b> <b>devices,</b> the designer must consider how cache coherency is maintained. This application note provides an overview and specific strategies for cache coherency and potential performance impacts in the Freescale PowerQUICC II Pro and PowerQUICC III families. It focuses on data coherency and potential system issues, as well as some concerns associated with having multiple DMA devices. It also discusses the specific steps and interdependencies required to implemen...|$|R

50|$|The design {{deliberately}} {{minimizes the}} amount of redundant logic required in the system. For example, a system always contains more slave <b>devices</b> than <b>master</b> <b>devices</b> {{so most of the}} complex logic required to implement asynchronous data transfers is forced into the relatively few <b>master</b> <b>devices.</b> For interrupts, only the interrupt-fielding processor needs to contain the complex timing logic. The end result is that most I/O controllers can be implemented with simple logic, and most of the critical logic is implemented as a custom MSI IC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{preventing}} the illegal copying of digital content whilst allowing content mobility within a single user domain. This paper proposes a novel solution for binding a domain to a single owner. Domain owners are authenticated using two-factor authentication, which involves “something the domain owner has”, i. e. a <b>Master</b> Control <b>device</b> that controls and manages consumers domains, and binds devices joining a domain to itself, and “something the domain owner is or knows”, i. e. a biometric or password/PIN authentication mechanism that is implemented by the <b>Master</b> Control <b>device.</b> These measures establish a one-to-many relationship between the <b>Master</b> Control <b>device</b> and domain devices, and a one-to-one relationship between domain owners and their <b>Master</b> Control <b>Devices,</b> ensuring that a single consumer owns each domain. This stops illicit content proliferation. Finally, {{the pros and cons of}} two possible approaches to user authentication, i. e. the use of a password/PIN and biometric authentication mechanisms, and possible countermeasures to the identified vulnerabilities are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} on Dynamic Time Sync Reference Load Balancing {{technique}} {{to enhance the}} Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol with Dynamic load balancing feature to utilize the redundant VRRP Backup device, inorder to share the traffic load. Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol acts as default gateway for the hosts on the shared Ethernet segment. VRRP protocol {{does not support the}} feature of load balancing for both the incoming and outgoing traffic. In this case, the <b>Master</b> VRRP <b>device</b> monitors the duration of the incoming traffic from a particular Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) segment and redirects the traffic to the Backup VRRP device incase if the <b>Master</b> VRRP <b>device</b> still has the existing session based on the duration of the flow of traffic and the number of session through the Netflow cache database. While implementing Dynamic time sync reference Load Balancing mechanism, the <b>Master</b> VRRP <b>device</b> redirects the traffic to Backup VRRP device through the ICMP Redirect message, incase there is an current session going through the <b>Master</b> VRRP <b>device</b> by dynamically monitoring the Active Flow per Second parameter information through the Netflow cache information through the Layer 3 switch thereby achieving the Dynamic Load Balancing feature with the use of existing Active Flow per Second timers to dynamically share the traffic load between the <b>Master</b> VRRP <b>device</b> and the Backup VRRP device...|$|R

5000|$|Often in a {{master-slave}} arrangement {{when one}} device dubbed [...] "the master" [...] initiates all communication activity, the <b>master</b> <b>device</b> itself provides the bias {{and not the}} slave devices. In this configuration, the <b>master</b> <b>device</b> is typically centrally located along the set of RS-485 wires, with two slave devices located at the physical end of the wires providing termination. The <b>master</b> <b>device</b> itself could provide termination if it were located at a physical end of the wires, but that is generally regarded as a bad topology design as the master operates optimally when located at a halfway point between the slave devices, thereby maximizing signal strength and therefore line distance and speed. Applying the bias at multiple node locations could possibly cause {{a violation of the}} RS-485 specification and cause communications to malfunction.|$|E

Teleoperation represents a very complexsensory-motor task, mainly {{due to the}} kinematic and kineticredundancies that characterize the human motor control. Itrequires an intensive training phase to acquire sufficient famil-iarity with the master-slave architecture. We estimated the hand stiffness modulation during theexecution of a simulated suturing task in teleoperation, withtwo different <b>master</b> <b>devices,</b> and in free-hand. Kinematicdata of eight right-handed users were acquired, using elec-tromagnetic and optical tracking systems, and analysed usinga musculoskeletal model. Through inverse dynamics, muscularactivation was computed and used to obtain the joint torqueand stiffness, leading to end-point stiffness estimation. Themaximal stiffness value and its angular displacement withrespect to the trajectory tangent was computed. The resultsshow {{that there is a}} difference in how the main stiffness axiswas modulated by using the two <b>master</b> <b>devices</b> with respectto free-hand, with higher values and variability for the seriallink manipulator.

Single-arm phase-retardation results in a halfwave voltage (V-pi) of 8. 4 V at 1600 nm. The on/off extinction ratio is better than 19 dB, resulting from precise Y-branch power splitters and good waveguide uniformity.

A piconet consists {{of two or more}} devices occupying the same physical channel (synchronized to a common clock and hopping sequence). It allows one <b>master</b> <b>device</b> to interconnect with up to seven active slave devices.

We show how the full MAC address of such <b>master</b> <b>devices</b> can be ob-tained, therefore bypassing the access control of this fea-ture.
