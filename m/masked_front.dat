40|$|Photomasks are the {{backbone}} of microfabrication industries. Currently they are fabricated by lithographic process, which is very expensive and time consuming since it is a several step process. These issues can be addressed by fabricating photomask by direct femtosecond laser writing, which is a single step process and comparatively cheaper and faster than lithography. In this paper we discuss about our investigations {{on the effect of}} two types of laser writing techniques, namely, front and rear side laser writing with regard to the feature size and the edge quality of the feature. It is proved conclusively that for the patterning of <b>mask,</b> <b>front</b> side laser writing is a better technique than rear side laser writing with regard to smaller feature size and better edge quality. Moreover the energy required for front side laser writing is considerably lower than that for rear side laser writing. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|R

50|$|For {{transformation}} of the (x, y) information into scattering angle ϕ a removable calibration <b>mask</b> in <b>front</b> of the entrance window is used. This mask allows correction for x and y distortions too. For notation detail, the cathode has an ion drift time {{on the order of}} a few ms.

40|$|Double-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a corner}} stone of quantum mechanics. It illustrates key features of quantum mechanics: interference and the particle-wave duality of matter. In 1965, Richard Feynman presented a thought experiment to show these features. Here we demonstrate the full realization {{of his famous}} thought experiment. By placing a movable <b>mask</b> in <b>front</b> of a double-slit to control the transmission through the individual slits, probability distributions for single- and double-slit arrangements were observed. Also, by recording single electron detection events diffracting through a double-slit, a diffraction pattern was built up from individual events. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The rest of the infantry, viz., 24th and 31st Punjaub Infantry and the 45th Sikhs, were to ascend the hills to the right, and deliver a flank attack on the head of the ridge. The cavalry were to be held in readiness to dash forward along the causeway--to repair which a company of sappers was posted--as soon as the enemy were driven off the ridge which commanded it, and pursue them across the rice fields into the open country beyond. The whole of the powerful artillery was to come into action at once.|$|R
