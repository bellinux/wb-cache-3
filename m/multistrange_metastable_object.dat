40|$|In several self-coupled {{quantum field}} {{theories}} when treated in semi-classical limit one obtains solitonic solutions determined by topology {{of the boundary}} conditions. Such solutions, e. g. magnetic monopole in unified theories [1] [2] or the skyrme model of hadrons have been proposed as possible non-perturbative bound states which remain stable due to topological quantum numbers. Furthermore when fermions are introduced, under certain conditions one obtains zero-energy solutions [5][6] for the Dirac equations localised on the soliton. An implication of such zero-modes is induced fermion number [7] carried by the soliton. <b>Metastable</b> topological <b>objects</b> were studied in [8]. It was shown in[9] that <b>metastable</b> <b>objects</b> can also carry fermion zero-modes and this can render a <b>metastable</b> <b>object</b> stable if the induced fermion number is fractional. This is true even if the fermion number is violated by a Majorana mass term. This result can be extended to metastable states of the cosmic string, {{in the form of}} loops. These can also possess fermion zero modes[10][11] leading to their absolute stability. A summary of these results constitutes this conference contribution. The existence of zero-modes and the possibility of fractional induced charge are well known results for which the reader is referred to [7]. We begin by discussing the induced stability of <b>metastable</b> topological <b>objects.</b> In what follows the bosonic fields constituting the soliton are treated as classical, and the fermion field is quantised in this background. In such a background, the Dirac field is expanded a...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of Coulomb {{interaction}} upon the nuclear liquid vapor phase transition. Because large nuclei (A> 60) are <b>metastable</b> <b>objects,</b> phases, phase coexistence, and phase transitions cannot be defined with any generality and the analogy to liquid vapor is ill-posed for these heavy systems. However, {{it is possible to}} account for the Coulomb interaction in the decay rates and obtain the coexistence phase diagram for the corresponding uncharged system.

40|$|A soap bubble is a <b>metastable</b> <b>object</b> that {{eventually}} breaks. Indeed, the soapy water film thins until rupture, due to drainage and evaporation. In our experimental investigations, floating bubbles {{at the surface}} of a liquid bath have been considered. Their lifetime has been measured and reported with respect to their radius. Large bubbles last longer than small ones. Moreover, small bubbles have more predictable lifetimes than large ones. We propose a general equation for that lifetime, based on the lubrication theory. The evaporation is shown to be an essential process which determines the bubble lifetime. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. Let...|$|R

Simulations are presented to estimate {{the sensitivity of the}} STAR and ALICE experiments to the detection of these objects, focusing mainly on metastable short-lived (weak decaying) strange dibaryons, with a particular emphasis on the H-dibaryon, a six quark-bag bound state (uuddss). 6 Refs...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{observations and}} numerical simulations of nonequilibrium spatial structures in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate subject to oscillatory perturbations. In experiment, first, there appear collective excitations, followed by quantum vortices. Increasing {{the amount of}} the injected energy leads to the formation of vortex tangles representing quantum turbulence. We study what happens after the regime of quantum turbulence, with increasing further the amount of injected energy. In such a strongly nonequilibrium Bosecondensed system of trapped atoms, vortices become destroyed and there develops a new kind of spatial structure exhibiting essentially heterogeneous spatial density. The structure is reminiscent of fog consisting of high-density droplets, or grains, surrounded by the regions of low density. The grains are randomly distributed in space, where they move. They live for a sufficiently long time to be treated as a type of <b>metastable</b> <b>object.</b> Such structures have been observed in nonequilibrium trapped Bose gases of 87 Rb, subject to the action of alternating fields. Here we present experimental results and support them by numerical simulation. The granular, or fog structure is essentially different from the state of wave turbulence that develops after increasing further the amount of injected energy. FAPESPCNPqRFB...|$|R
40|$|A {{differentially}} rotating hypermassive {{neutron star}} (HMNS) is a <b>metastable</b> <b>object</b> {{which can be}} formed in the merger of neutron-star binaries. The eventual collapse of the HMNS into a black hole {{is a key element}} in generating the physical conditions expected to accompany the launch of a short gamma-ray burst. We investigate the influence of magnetic fields on HMNSs by performing three-dimensional simulations in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In particular, we provide direct evidence for the occurrence of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in HMNS interiors. For the first time in simulations of these systems, rapidly-growing and spatially-periodic structures are observed to form with features like those of the channel flows produced by the MRI in other systems. Moreover, the growth time and wavelength of the fastest-growing mode are extracted and compared successfully with analytical predictions. The MRI emerges as an important mechanism to amplify magnetic fields over the lifetime of the HMNS, whose collapse to a black hole is accelerated. The evidence provided here that the MRI can actually develop in HMNSs could have a profound impact on the outcome of the merger of neutron-star binaries and on its connection to short gamma-ray bursts.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the response of}} the QCD ground state at finite baryon density to a strong magnetic field B. We point out the dominant role played by the coupling of neutral Goldstone bosons, such as pi^ 0, to the magnetic field via the axial triangle anomaly. We show that, in vacuum, above a value of B ~ m_pi^ 2 /e, a <b>metastable</b> <b>object</b> appears - the pi^ 0 domain wall. Because of the axial anomaly, the wall carries a baryon number surface density proportional to B. As a result, for B ~ 10 ^{ 19 } G a stack of parallel pi^ 0 domain walls is energetically more favorable than nuclear matter at the same density. Similarly, at higher densities, somewhat weaker magnetic fields of order B ~ 10 ^{ 17 }- 10 ^{ 18 } G transform the color-superconducting ground state of QCD into new phases containing stacks of axial isoscalar (eta or eta') domain walls. We also show that a quark-matter state known as ``Goldstone current state,'' in which a gradient of a Goldstone field is spontaneously generated, is ferromagnetic due to the axial anomaly. We estimate the size of the fields created by such a state in a typical neutron star to be of order 10 ^{ 14 }- 10 ^{ 15 } G.

Then we examine the possibility of producing and evidencing such an exotic strange matter, also including pure hyperonic bound states ((Lambda Lambda) /sub b/, (Xi Lambda) /sub b/), at RHIC and LHC. Simulations are presented to estimate the sensitivity of the STAR and ALICE experiments to the detection of these objects, focusing mainly on the metastable short- lived (weak-decaying) strange dibaryons, with a particular emphasis on the H-dibaryon, a six-quark-bag bound state (uuddss).

40|$|A reanalysis of {{data from}} a recent search for ultraheavy {{isotopes}} of gold and iron leads to new constraints on several classes of exotic objects. These include strangelets, MEMOs (<b>metastable</b> exotic multihypernuclear <b>objects),</b> and CHAMPs (charged massive particles) {{which may have been}} present in the data, but which could have nonetheless gone undetected due to the design of the original experiment. As a result of the new analysis we are able to greatly enlarge the exclusion regions for exotic particles of mass M and charge Z, and provide limits as low as 10 (- 11) for small M/Z, and 10 (- 7) for M/Z up to 120...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of quantum}} {{mechanics}} is to explain macroscopic, objectively recorded phenomena. Microscopic objects are measured by enabling them to interact with a macroscopic measuring apparatus prepared in a <b>metastable</b> state. Macroscopic <b>objects,</b> such as cats, are not above the laws {{of quantum mechanics}}, but owing to their enormously dense level spectrum other aspects than single eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are prominent. These aspects {{can be described in}} classical terms, such as probabilities instead of probability amplitudes. The measuring act is fully described by the Schrodinger equation for object system and apparatus together. The collapse of the wave function is a consequence rather than an additional postulate. A model is constructed to demonstrate these statements. It also appears that the entropies of the object system and the apparatus increase by the same amount, namely the entropy difference between the metastable initial state and the stable final state of the apparatus. 1. Formulation of the problem Many a theory in physics makes use of mathematical entities that do not correspond to an intuitively understandable physical object. Of course intuition can be educated; as a consequence some of these entities, for instance energy...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic {{heavy ion}} {{collisions}} constitute a prolific source of hyperons: tens of hyperons per event are predicted at energies E&# 8805; 10 GeV/nucleon, providing a scenario {{for the formation}} of <b>metastable</b> exotic multihypernuclear <b>objects.</b> They may exhibit exceptional properties: bound neutral (e. g., 4 M 2 &# 923; 2 n, 10 M 2 &# 923; 8 n, pure &# 923; droplets, 8 &# 923;) and even negatively charged composites objects with positive baryon number (e. g., 4 M 2 &# 931;- 2 n, 6 M 2 &# 923; 2 &# 926;- 2 n) could be formed in rare events. Such negative nuclei can easily be identified in a magnetic spectrometer. They could be considerably more abundant than antinuclei of the same A. We use the relativistic meson-baryon field theory—which gives an excellent description of normal nuclear and single-&# 923; hypernuclear properties—to calculate the rich spectrum of such exotic objects, their stability, and their structure. We also find solutions for a large variety of bound short-lived nuclei (e. g., 8 M 2 &# 923;, 2 &# 931;- 2 p 2 n), which may decay strongly via formation of cascade (&# 926;) particles. Multi-&# 926; hypernuclei are also evaluated. A variety of potential candidates for such metastable exotic nuclei is presented. It turns out that the properties of such exotic multihypernuclear objects reveal quite similar features as the strangelet proposed as a unique signature for quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions...|$|R
