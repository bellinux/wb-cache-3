The Le Mans branch was opened for 300 km/h (186 mph) revenue service on 20 September 1989, and the Tours branch opened a year later.

50|$|Attempts to make finer tyre and flange {{standards}} were thwarted initially by the overscale rail sections available commercially, it being impractical {{for an individual}} modeller to make smaller rails - although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail.

They were initially the most elaborate turnouts in Germany. As {{the continuation of the}} high-speed line to Stuttgart was then under construction, the points were initially fixed in the branching position. Their length is 154 m and their weight (including the concrete sleepers) is 210 t. The point blades are 40 m-long, the moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are 15 m long. The radius of the branching track is initially 7,000 m and reduces at the frog to 6000 m. The two sets of point blades are operated by two turnout motors with eight points of activation and closed with eight clamps. Separate test contacts are used to monitor the position of the points. The moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are activated by a motor and secured by three clip fasteners. In the points area, two points signals are installed at the approaches and a third in the centre of the turnout. Another innovation was the use of slide chairs that require little lubrication. The two turnouts are still among the fastest in terms of operating speeds in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The first iron plate railway, {{made with}} wrought iron plates {{on top of}} wooden rails, came into use in 1768. This allowed a {{variation}} of gauge to be used.

From the 1790s, iron edge rails began to appear in Great Britain. In 1803, William Jessop opened the Surrey Iron Railway in south London, arguably the world's first horse-drawn public railway. The invention of the wrought iron rail by John Birkinshaw in 1820 allowed the short, brittle, and often uneven, cast iron rails to be extended to 15 ft lengths. These were succeeded by steel in 1857.|$|R

40|$|A fast {{obstacle}} avoidance algorithm based on sensor data {{is required for}} an autonomous vehicle to move at high speed. When a vehicle is nonholonomic and it has polygonal body, the method using configuration space is usually applied to such a vehicle. But, it is complex and it needs much computing power. On the other hand, artificial potential field is often used for real-time {{obstacle avoidance}}, however, most of them consider a vehicle as an omnidirectional <b>movable</b> <b>point.</b> Therefore, we propose a new method of practical obstacle avoidance for a nonholonomic vehicle with rectangular body. Application points of repulsive forces from obstacles are located in both {{the front and rear}} of vehicle's body. Their forces are generated according to the distances between obstacle and vehicle's body. Rear forces are transferred to the front by inverting and the resultant force moves the vehicle.

It is proved that if f:TâT is a tree map which has a chain <b>movable</b> fixed <b>point</b> v, and the chain equivalent set CE(v,f) is not contained in the set P(f) of periodic points of f, then there exists a positive integer p not greater than the number of points in the set End([CE(v,f) ]) âPv(f) such that fp is turbulent, and the topological entropy h(f) â©¾(log 2) /p.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a real-time shadow generation algorithm for polygonal environments illuminated by <b>movable</b> <b>point</b> light sources. The main {{goal is to}} quickly {{reduce the number of}} hidden shadow volumes, by using a technique of volumetric shadow rendering using stencil buffers with a modified BSP tree, i. e. a simplified version of a SVBSP (Shadow Volume BSP) tree. It also provides new easy-to-implement approaches to improvement techniques used in shadow volume algorithms, such as silhouette detection {{to reduce the number of}} redundant shadow polygons and the computation of capping polygons to handle cases where the shadow volumes are clipped by the eye-view near clipping plane. Such hybrid approach solves important limitations on the original shadow rendering algorithm, as well as achieves real-time frame rates when using modest size scenes (about 500 shadow polygons), according to measurements performed on personal computers using current graphics hardware. Per-phase timing results from the implementation are provided along the text and compared with those of the standard algorithm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an object-space shadow generation algorithm for static polygonal environments illuminated by <b>movable</b> <b>point</b> light sources. The algorithm {{can be easily}} implemented on any graphics system that provides fast polygon scan-conversion and achieves near real-time performance for environments of modest size. It combines elements of two kinds of current shadow generation algorithms: two-pass object-space approaches and shadow volume approaches. For each light source a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree is constructed that represents the shadow volume of the polygons facing it. As each polygon's contribution to a light source's shadow volume is determined, the polygon's shadowed and lit fragments are computed by filtering it down the shadow volume BSP tree. The polygonal scene with its computed shadows can be rendered with any polygon-based visible-surface algorithm. Since the shadow volumes and shadows are computed in object space, {{they can be used}} for further analysis of the scene. Pseudocode is provided, along with pictures and timings from an interactive implementation...|$|R

While the Ludwigsfelde-Dennewitz section, which was controlled by the Berlin Reichsbahn division, was equipped until 1978 with track plan interlockings (including the first interlocking of the GsIIISp68 class in JÃ¼terbog station) and automatic block signalling, the NiedergÃ¶rsdorf-Leipzig section, which was controlled by the Halle Reichsbahn division, continued to be signalled with conventional systems. As part of its resignalling with the PunktfÃ¶rmige Zugbeeinflussung train protection system the remaining semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals. During the upgrade to 200 km/h, the whole line was equipped with electronic interlockings between 1992 and 1999.
