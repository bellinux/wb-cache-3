5|$|Damage <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> {{directly}} under the site of impact, or it <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> on the side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.|$|E

30|$|Figure 6 b {{shows the}} {{coagulation}} of Ag nanoparticles, which was likely {{a result of}} three potential processes. First, agglomeration <b>may</b> have <b>occurred</b> during handling or processing due to the high specific surface area of the nanoparticles. Second, it <b>may</b> have <b>occurred</b> during the drying process of sample preparation. Finally, it <b>may</b> have <b>occurred</b> during condensation.|$|R
50|$|Diarrhea <b>may</b> also <b>occur.</b>|$|R
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that <b>may</b> <b>occur.</b> Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical blindness, and a depressed mood. Depression <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae <b>may</b> <b>occur.</b> The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
25|$|Ventral midline {{symptoms}} <b>may</b> also <b>occur.</b>|$|R

50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} or shingles <b>may</b> also <b>occur.</b>|$|R
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{it often}} makes short {{distance}} movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements <b>may</b> <b>occur,</b> {{as suggested by}} a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Keto{{acidosis}} is {{not always}} the result of diabetes. It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. Metabolic acidosis <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde.|$|E
50|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} <b>may</b> also <b>occur</b> with molar pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|Complications in {{the form}} of endocarditis, liver {{inflammation}}, inflammation of the heart's muscle, joint inflammation, keratoconjunctivitis (occasionally extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the lacrimal gland/orbit), and neurologic complications (brain inflammation) <b>may</b> occasionally <b>occur.</b> Severe pneumonia requiring intensive-care support <b>may</b> also <b>occur.</b> Fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases).|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} other {{congenital}} abnormalities <b>may</b> also <b>occur</b> in DBA.|$|R
5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|Metastasis of {{lung cancer}} {{requires}} transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cell type. This <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> through activation of signaling pathways such as Akt/GSK3Beta, MEK-ERK, Fas, and Par6.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel <b>may</b> <b>occur).</b>|$|E

5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1â€“12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam, and triazolam.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} indication that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in diving injuries.|$|E
5|$|The opening shot of {{the movie}} shows Kunti praying for Lord Krishna's {{protection}} for the Pandavas. Lord Krishna consoles Kunti and promises to ever protect the Pandavas and guide them through troubles and problems that <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in their life.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} conditions are: decompression illness (which covers {{decompression sickness}} and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although {{some of these}} <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation <b>may</b> <b>occur</b> however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia <b>may</b> <b>occur.</b> Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{involves}} monitoring as well {{as physical}} and cognitive rest (reduction of such activities as school work, playing video games and text messaging). Symptoms usually resolve within three weeks, though they may persist or complications <b>may</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
