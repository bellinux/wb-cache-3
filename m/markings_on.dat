5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow <b>markings</b> <b>on</b> gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The <b>markings</b> <b>on</b> S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E
