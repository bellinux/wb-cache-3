5|$|Following the {{election}} of the Menzies Liberal government in the 1949 elections, White was appointed <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Air and <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Civil Aviation, despite his personal animosity for Menzies, which partly stemmed from the latter's failure to serve in the First World War. In January 1950, White and the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Supply and Development, Richard Casey, announced that the English Electric Canberra had been selected to replace the RAAF's Avro Lincoln bombers and that the new jet would be manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factory in Victoria. White's term as <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Air saw the deployment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency in mid-1950, and the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force, the successor organisation to the wartime Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, that November. The following year he gave his approval for the manufacture of a licensed version of the North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter for the RAAF, and played a major part in the controversial decision to replace the long-serving Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal (Sir) George Jones, with an RAF officer, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) Donald Hardman. White also sought to strengthen the Citizen Air Force, and personally ordered the establishment of No.24 (City of Adelaide) Squadron at Mallala, South Australia.|$|E
