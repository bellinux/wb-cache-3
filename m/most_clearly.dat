5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> {{defined in}} Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As {{part of the}} Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} where Tracy is on his bacon run, every mention of January 17th is either shot so the actor's mouth is hidden or dubbed over. This can be seen <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> when Cerie says January 17th. It seems the {{original}} was February 17th but later changed to match the release date of the episode. Closed captioning still shows February 17th.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Pollack’s {{emphasis}} on the player’s experience along with his effectiveness in growing the WSOP cast him in a good light. This can be seen <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> through the extent of support he received when he announced his resignation as commissioner. One commentator declared, “the news hit the poker world … {{like a ton of}} bricks,” and that his tenure in the role “may be unmatched.” Well-known players like Phil Hellmuth, Peter Eastgate and Barry Goldstein expressed their esteem for Pollack.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. These early Gothic homes were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style. Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged <b>most</b> <b>clearly,</b> in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E

50|$|The poet’s {{examination}} {{of a society}} actualized chiefly by the working class, is his <b>most</b> lucid, <b>clearly</b> constructed work, and clearly exhibits the poetic transformation undergone in the late 1980s. In the late 1990s, Kim published another collection of poetry entitled About Trains. The poems in this collection, through simple, concise diction free of the occasional monotony of prose, effectively reveal the worldview and character of the working class.|$|R
5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} {{taken up the}} issue of aboriginal title in the United States. However, with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all the disputes had been between non-Indianstypically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid–Saffarid {{partnership}} in Iran was <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed in their joint effort against the general Rafi ibn Harthama, {{who had made}} his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid interests in the region. Al-Mu'tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi, who fled and made common cause with the Zaydis of Tabaristan {{in an effort to}} seize Khurasan from the Saffarids. However, with Amr mobilizing the anti-Alid sentiments of the populace against him and the expected assistance from the Zaydis failing to materialize, Rafi was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896. Amr, now at the pinnacle of his power, sent the defeated rebel's head to Baghdad, and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him. The partnership finally collapsed after Mu'tadid appointed the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al-Layth in 898 as governor of Transoxiana, which was ruled by his rivals, the Samanids. Al-Mu'tamid deliberately encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids, only for Amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by the latter in 900. The Samanid ruler, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, sent him in chains to Baghdad, where he was executed in 902, after al-Mu'tadid's death. Al-Mu'tadid in turn conferred Amr's titles and governorships to Isma'il ibn Ahmad. The Caliph also moved to regain Fars and Kirman, but the Saffarid remnant under Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the Abbasid attempts at capturing these two provinces for several years. It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province.|$|E
