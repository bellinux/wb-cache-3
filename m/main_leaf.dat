The trunk has light grey bark with brown lenticels. New branchlets and leaves are hairy. The green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms, which are arranged alternately along the stems. Very young plants begin with their first two to four leaves having two or three lobes, but then have narrow [...] leaves with entire margins, measuring 6.5 to 18cm (2.6–7.2in) long and 1.3–2.2cm (0.5–0.8in) wide. These are then succeeded by pinnate juvenile leaves that have two to nine lobes arising at 30 to 40degrees forwards, and reach 50cm (20in) long. They have prominent midveins along the midline of the <b>main</b> <b>leaf</b> and the lobes. The elliptic or [...] (egg-shaped) adult leaves are 8–25cm (3.2–10in) long and up to 4.5cm (1.8in) wide, and sit on 1.5 to 2.5-cm (0.6–1in) long petioles.|$|E

The relationship between <b>main</b> stem <b>leaf</b> numbers (HS) versus degree-days was described using bilinear model.

40|$|General Description. —Graythorn is {{also known}} as lote bush, southwestern condalia, prairie bush, or thornbush. This shrub reaches heights of 2 to 3 m but is often shorter. Stems are grayish green due to a whitish or grayish wax-like bloom, which helps to {{distinguish}} Ziziphus from Condalia. The stems are robust, grooved, highly branched, although terminal branches are short, and bear stout spine-tips. The stem branching pattern gives this shrub an irregular shape. Side branches tend to come out at right angles from the main axis.

40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Under certain South African conditions, Redglobe {{develops}} a colour {{that is too}} dark and thus unacceptable for the Far Eastern markets. These markets require a pink colour instead of a dark red colour. The cultivation of grapes with an acceptable colour involves amongst other, canopy management practices. This generally includes the removal of leaves and/or lateral shoots. Hereby, the leaf area and the microclimatic conditions in the canopy are altered. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the usefulness of leaf and lateral shoot removal at different defoliation times after anthesis in order to obtain a pink coloured Redglobe crop. Other quality aspects, namely total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TTA), berry mass and total yield, were also evaluated. A canopy management trial was conducted on six year old Redglobe vines with moderate vigour. The treatment design was a 2 x 3 x 4 factorial and involved two leaf removal (L) levels (L 0 = 0 % leaf removal; L 33 = 33 % leaf removal) in combination with three lateral shoot removal (LS) levels (LS 0 = 0 % lateral shoot removal; LS 50 = 50 % lateral shoot removal; LS 100 = 100 % lateral shoot removal). Four defoliation times (DT) were selected: 36 (pea berry size), 69 (véraison), 76 (one week after véraison) and 83 (two weeks after véraison) days after anthesis (DAA). A total of 24 treatment combinations, replicated in four blocks, were applied. Generally, treatment combinations involving 33 % leaf removal lowered the <b>main</b> shoot <b>leaf</b> area. Likewise, the lateral shoot leaf area was decreased by increasing levels of lateral shoot removal at any defoliation time. As expected, 33 % leaf removal applied in combination with any level of lateral shoot removal, always resulted in a lower total vine leaf area compared to where 0 % leaf removal was part of the treatment combination. Compensation reactions occurred and in this regard the <b>main</b> shoot <b>leaf</b> size increased due to 33 % leaf removal applied at 1 week after véraison and 2 weeks after véraison. Treatment combinations involving lateral shoot removal increased the ratio of <b>main</b> shoot <b>leaf</b> area to the total leaf area. On the other hand, the <b>main</b> shoot <b>leaf</b> area percentage was lowered by the application of 33 % leaf removal at 2 weeks after véraison compared to no leaf removal at the same defoliation time. It can therefore be assumed that the contribution of lateral shoot leaves to grape composition might have increased in cases where the <b>main</b> shoot <b>leaf</b> area was lowered at a later stage (e. g. 2 weeks after véraison). The bunches were visually evaluated and divided into classes from dark (class one) to light (class nine). This visual bunch evaluation showed that the mean bunch colour was in class three (lighter than class two) due to the defoliation time. The lateral shoot removal x leaf removal interaction resulted in a mean bunch colour that was in classes 2 and 3. However, within these classes, there was a tendency that bunch colour decreased for defoliation times later than pea berry size. The lateral shoot removal x leaf removal interactions showed that bunch colour was darker when the treatment combinations involved 0 % leaf removal. The percentage of bunches with the desired colour was increased by application of the treatments at véraison, compared to the other defoliation times, and also with 50 % lateral shoot removal and 100 % lateral shoot removal compared to 0 % lateral shoot removal. Biochemical analyses confirmed that increased levels of lateral shoot removal generally lowered the anthocyanin concentration regardless of defoliation time. A similar effect on TSS was observed, i. e. from véraison onwards, the application of 50 % lateral shoot removal and 100 % lateral shoot removal tended to lower TSS. The effect of these levels of lateral shoot removal at véraison was significant. The role of the lateral shoots in colour development and sugar accumulation is therefore emphasized. Furthermore, the special role that lateral shoots also play in berry development is illustrated in that berry mass tended to decrease when 100 % lateral shoot removal in combination with 33 % leaf removal and 100 % lateral shoot removal in combination with 0 % leaf removal were applied at véraison. This, together with the positive relationship obtained between grape colour and the lateral shoot leaf area:fruit mass ratio, accentuates the role of active leaf area during the ripening period. The possible effect of the microclimatic light environment on colour must also be considered. However, although the light intensity increased with increased levels of LS, the colour that was obtained was probably not associated with the differences in light intensity. It was found that it is possible to manipulate the colour of Redglobe grapes with defoliation treatments. However, the treatments that have a decreasing effect on grape colour also affected other quality parameters like TSS and berry size negatively. Although, it is possible to reduce the colour of Redglobe through the application of leaf and lateral shoot removal at different defoliation times, the question arises whether the treatment combinations used in this study are worthwhile to pursue because the mean bunch colour that was obtained was still too dark. However, it was possible to increase the percentage of bunches with the desired colour. Therefore, if such treatments are applied, it must be approached cautiously, keeping in mind that assimilate supply has to be sustained throughout the ripening period...|$|R

The biological efficiency, nutritional value, composition and nutrient balance (C, N and P) achieved with these substrates were studied. The most suitable substrate that produced higher yields and biological efficiency was PS mixed with BDR followed by coir pith with BDR. Addition of BDR with agro-residues could increase mushroom yield by 20 - 30 %. The biological efficiency achieved was high for PS + BDR (231. 93 % for P. florida and 209. 92 % for P. flabellatus) and for CP + BDR (14831 % for P. florida and 188. 46 % for P. flabellatus).
