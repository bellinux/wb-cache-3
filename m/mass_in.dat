5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter {{is the only one of}} the village's churches that still functions as a church.|$|E

5|$|After {{the coup}} and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed good working {{relationship}} with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral <b>mass.</b> <b>In</b> 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel.

5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert <b>Mass,</b> <b>in</b> order for the music to {{continue}} seamlessly.

5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low <b>Mass</b> <b>in</b> Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

40|$|Since 1974, {{grey scale}} {{sonography}} {{has been used}} with increasing frequency <b>in</b> evaluating abdominal <b>masses</b> <b>in</b> children.
