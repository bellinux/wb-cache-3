40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the mechanical properties of dense, vertically aligned CNT foams subject to one-dimensional compressive loading. We develop a discrete model directly inspired by the micromechanical response reported experimentally for CNT foams, where infinitesimal portions of the tubes are represented by collections of uniform bi-stable springs. Under cyclic loading, the given model predicts an initial elastic deformation, a non-homogeneous buckling regime, and a densification response, accompanied by a hysteretic unloading path. We compute the dynamic dissipation of such a model through an analytic approach. The continuum limit of the <b>microscopic</b> <b>spring</b> chain defines a mesoscopic dissipative element (micro-meso transition) which represents a finite portion of the foam thickness. An upper-scale model formed by a chain of non-uniform mesoscopic springs is employed to describe the entire CNT foam. A numerical approximation illustrates the main features of the proposed multiscale approach. Available experimental results on the compressive response of CNT foams are fitted with excellent agreement...|$|E
40|$|A 3 D {{distinct}} lattice spring model (DLSM) {{is proposed}} where matter is discretized into individual particles linked by springs. The presented model {{is different from}} the conventional lattice spring models where a shear spring is introduced to model the multibody force by evaluating the spring deformation from the local strain rather than the particle displacement. By doing this, the proposed model can represent the diversity of Poisson’s ratio without violating the rotational invariance. The local strain of the spring is calculated through a least square method which makes the model possessing meshless properties. Because of this and explicitly representing the microstructure, DLSM is able to model dynamic fracturing problems and can be used to study the microstructure influences. The material parameters inputted in the model is the conventional material parameters, e. g. the elastic modules and the Poisson’s ratio. Relationships between <b>microscopic</b> <b>spring</b> parameters and macroscopic material constants are derived based on the Cauchy–Born rules and the hyperelastic theory. Numerical examples are presented to show the abilities and propertie...|$|E
5000|$|The French {{biologist}} Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), {{regarded as}} the [...] "Father of microbiological sciences and immunology", worked during the 19th century. [...] He postulated - and supported with experimental results - the idea that disease-causing agents do not spontaneously appear but are alive and need the right environment to prosper and multiply. Stemming from this discovery, he used experimentation to develop vaccines for chicken cholera, anthrax and rabies, and to develop methods for reducing bacteria in some food products by heating them (pasteurization). His work also led him to advocate (along with the English physician Dr. Joseph Lister) for antiseptic surgical techniques. Most scientists of that day believed that <b>microscopic</b> life <b>sprang</b> into existence from nonliving matter. This idea was called spontaneous generation.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a protocol {{to measure the}} bending rigidity of filamentous rod-shaped bacteria. Forces are applied with an optical trap, a <b>microscopic</b> three-dimensional <b>spring</b> made of light that is formed when a high-intensity laser beam is focused to a very small spot by a microscope's objective lens. To bend a cell, we first bind live bacteria to a chemically-treated coverslip. As these cells grow, {{the middle of the}} cells remains bound to the coverslip but the growing ends are free of this restraint. By inducing filamentous growth with the drug cephalexin, we are able to identify cells in which one end of the cell was stuck to the surface while the other end remained unattached and susceptible to bending forces. A bending force is then applied with an optical trap by binding a polylysine-coated bead to the tip of a growing cell. Both the force and the displacement of the bead are recorded and the bending stiffness of the cell is the slope of this relationship.

30|$|Clear, quartersawn, musical {{instrument}} spruce {{has been shown}} to have remarkably consistent <b>microscopic</b> properties in <b>spring</b> and summer growth. Furthermore, spruce displays an abrupt transition period which means that micro-scale properties are generally in line with macro-scale mechanical properties (Kahle & Woodhouse 1994). Therefore, by avoiding visual imperfections as is currently being done in industry, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that bulk material properties taken on a specimen-by-specimen basis is an adequate measure of overall system performance. However, it would be interesting to investigate how localized changes in material properties would affect system performance, especially at the location of the brace. Modifications to the method, by increasing the number of zones of interest in the kinetic and strain energy equations for example, could take into account micro-scale variations in the material specimen. On the other hand, more rigorous testing of material properties would be necessary to populate the input information required for the analysis. On the macro-scale, CNC machinery could be reprogrammed to shape braces as required by the material property measurements of the plate.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{numerous}} single-molecule techniques {{have been developed}} to investigate individual bio-molecules and cellular machines. While a lot is known about the structure, localization, and interaction partners of such molecules, much less is known about their mechanical properties. To investigate the weak, non-covalent interactions that give rise to the mechanics of and between proteins, an instrument capable of resolving sub-nanometer displacements and piconewton forces is necessary. One of the most prominent biophysical tool with such capabilities is an optical tweezers. Optical tweezers is a non-invasive all-optical technique in which typically a dielectric microsphere is held by a tightly focused laser beam. This microsphere acts like a <b>microscopic,</b> three-dimensional <b>spring</b> and is used as a handle to study the biological molecule of interest. By interferometric detection methods, the resolution of optical tweezers can be in the picometer range on millisecond time scales. However, on a time scale of seconds—at which many biological reactions take place—instrumental noise such as thermal drift often limits the resolution to a few nanometers. Such a resolution is insufficient to resolve, for example, the ångstrom-level, stepwise translocation of DNA-binding enzymes corresponding to distances between single basepairs of their substrate. To reduce drift and noise, differential measurements, feedback-based drift stabilization techniques, and ‘levitated’ experiments have been developed. Such methods have the drawback of complicated and expensive experimental equipment often coupled to a reduced throughput of experiments due to a complex and serial assembly of the molecular components of the experiments. We developed a high-resolution optical tweezers apparatus capable of resolving distances on the ångstrom-level over a time range of milliseconds to 10 s of seconds in surface-coupled assays. Surface-coupled assays allow for a higher throughput because the molecular components are assembled in a parallel fashion on many probes. The high resolution was a collective result of a number of simple, easy-to-implement, and cost-efficient noise reduction solutions. In particular, we reduced thermal drift by implementing a temperature feedback system with millikelvin precision—a convenient solution for biological experiments since it minimizes drift in addition to enabling the control and stabilization of the experiment’s temperature. Furthermore, we found that expanding the laser beam to a size smaller than the objective’s exit pupil optimized the amount of laser power utilized in generating the trapping forces. With lower powers, biological samples are less susceptible to photo-damage or, vice versa, with the same laser power, higher trapping forces can be achieved. With motorized and automated procedures, our instrument is optimized for high-resolution, high-throughput surface-coupled experiments probing the mechanics of individual biomolecules. In the future, the combination of this setup with single-molecule fluorescence, super-resolution microscopy or torque detection will open up new possibilities for investigating the nanomechanics of biomolecules...|$|R
