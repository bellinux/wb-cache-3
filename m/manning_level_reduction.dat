40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-empirical method {{for the analysis}} of manning policies in firefighting. Since manpower costs account for a major share of non-volunteer fire departments' budgets, <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> {{is one of the most}} important policy issues relating to fire departments faced by local government decision makers. Yet, practically no analytic research of <b>manning</b> <b>levels</b> has been previously carried out. The method described in this paper uses an activity network approach to describe fireground command operations and a structured interview to obtain data. The technique was used to analyze the effect of <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> in one- and two-family residential fires in the city of Calgary, Canada. A series of structured interviews with fire department officers generated data concerning precedence relations among activities, their durations, and their manpower requirements. These were used to establish a relationship between <b>manning</b> <b>levels</b> and time needed to extinguish the fire. The analysis indicated that there is a limit on <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> above which only marginal improvement can be obtained. Also, the effect of an additional firefighter depends on the existing <b>manning</b> <b>level.</b> The results presented here are of a preliminary nature. However, they seem to lend credibility to the technique. In addition, we discuss some qualitative conclusions and other possible uses of the method. government services: fire, networks: applications, policy analysis...|$|R

40|$|An Active Noise Control (ANC) {{system for}} ducted fan noise was built that uses {{actuators}} located in stator vanes. The custom designed actuators A,ere piezoelectric benders manufactured using THUNDER technology. The ANC system was {{tested in the}} NASA Active Noise Control Fan rig. A total of 168 actuators in 28 stator vanes were used (six per vane). Simultaneous inlet and exhaust acoustic power <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> were demonstrated for a fan modal structure that contained two radial modes in each direction. Total circumferential mode power levels were reduced by up to 9 dB in the inlet and 3 dB in the exhaust. The corresponding total 2 BPF tone <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> were by 6 dB in the inlet and 2 dB in the exhaust. Farfield sound pressure <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> of up to 17 dB were achieved at the peak mode lobe angle. The performance of the system was limited by {{the constraints of the}} power amplifiers and the presence of control spillover. Simpler control/actuator systems using carefully selected subsets of the full system and random simulated failures of up to 7 % of the actuators were investigated. (The actuators were robust and none failed during the test). Useful reductions still occurred under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Water level {{fluctuations}} play {{a significant}} role in the lake nutrient dynamics, and consequently may have a strong influence on the biological communities and productivity. In this article we investigated the effects of a long term water <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> on key chemistry parameters and major biological communities in an eastern Mediterranean lake. Our approach is based on temporal data regarding water quality, fish, zooplankton and aquatic vegetation that are representative of different water level periods. The results revealed significant correlations between water level, conductivity and chloride concentration suggesting a clear effect of the water <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> on the water quality. Among the key findings of this study is the significant increase of zoobenthivorous fish (roach and carp) from 1973 to 1999 that correlates with the water <b>level</b> <b>reduction.</b> A decline of charophytes is also noted whereas the reed beds appear to have expanded at the shallower parts of the lake. The zooplankton composition of the lake is mostly dominated by nauplii, rotifer and small-sized crustaceans indicating a possible effect of fish predation. Overall, this article has ascertained an alarming shift of water quality and composition of biological communities that can be attributed to the combined effects of eutrophication and the extreme water level decrease...|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{water table}} {{variations}} and subsidence in HQHS-HSHT crossing for 2001 – 2010 suggests that groundwater extraction cannot {{be the only}} reason for subsidence, as water level barely dropped by 4  m while 1.5 subsidence was measured. However, as discussed before, lack of groundwater elevation {{for a number of}} important wells influences the maps in this period. Therefore, considering the 9.93  m water <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> measured from 2001 to 2011 and the existence of a thick layer of clay in that area, it can be concluded that water <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> is the main cause of subsidence in this area. In conclusion, there is an evident general trend of subsidence under water table variations during 2001 – 2010, except in parts of Shahriar Plain (as discussed before) where groundwater elevation escalated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Static {{characteristics}} of fuel cells show {{more than a}} 30 % difference in the output voltage between no-load to full-load conditions. This inevitable decrease, which is caused by internal losses, reduces the utilization factor of the fuel cells at low loads. Additionally, the converters fed by these fuel cells have to be derated to accommodate higher input voltages at low currents. To increase the utilization of fuel cells and to avoid derating of semiconductors, this paper proposes a <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> control using a multilevel inverter. <b>Level</b> <b>reduction</b> is done by inhibiting {{a certain number of}} fuel cells when the load current decreases. The inhibited fuel cells can be used in other applications such as charging batteries to further increase their utilization and the efficiency of the system. I...|$|R
