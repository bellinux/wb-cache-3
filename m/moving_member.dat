5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner <b>moving</b> <b>member</b> is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1917 {{there were}} {{available}} {{several types of}} instruments for measuring and recording pressures internal combustion engine cylinders. Some of these were refinements of the conventional pressure indicator designed for low-speed steam engines while others were designed primarily for high-speed work {{with a view of}} minimizing the effects of inertia. These instruments were found to be useful for various classes of work, depending on theirdesign and characteristics, although none of them had found more than very limited application in a comparatively few laboratories. Some of the inherent difficulties which have prevented the development of a wholly convenient and successful high-speed indicator are inertia, friction, and backlash in moving parts where mechanical means of recording are adopted; inertia and vibration of the system when a photographic method of magnification is applied to an instrument mounted on the engine; time lag of the gases in the connecting tube where a photographic apparatus is mounted independently of the engine and connects to it by a flexible tube; as well as the usual mechanical difficulties in the construction and operation of instruments of this class. It is noted that these difficulties are increased {{in the case of the}} aircraft engine, which usually must be mounted on a more or less flexible stand and in which at best the mechanical vibrations of the parts are excessive, due to their light weight and lack ofrigidity. An important mechanical consequence of this excessive flexibility of the engine structure seems to have been overlooked, since it has not been discussed in the literature or taken account of other than accidentally in design of any indicator. To illustrate this effect, assume an indicator whose moving parts are mounted on the head of an engine cyIinder. In order to reduce the effect of inertia, the range of motion of the piston or diaphragm is reduced as much as practicable and the motion magnified either mechanically or optically so as to give a readable scale. It should be noted that the motion actually recorded is always the relative motion between the movable part of the indicator and the (supposeclIy) fixed partmounted rigidly on the cylinder head. But if the cylinder head itself flexes under pressure or mechanical vibration, this motion of the fixed support relative to the movable piston is recorded and magnified as well as the motion of the piston relative to its support. Hence it may happen that thus limiting the range of motion of the piston or heavy diaphragm and greatly magnifying the record, increases the bad effects of inertia. on a light flexible engine cylinder since the motions of the cylinder head itself, relative to the <b>moving</b> <b>member,</b> are subject to the same degree of magnification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A brake is {{a device}} {{by means of}} which {{artificial}} frictional resistance is applied to a <b>moving</b> <b>member,</b> in order to retard or stop the motion of a machine. In the process of performing this function, the brake absorbs either kinematic energy of <b>moving</b> <b>member</b> or potential energy given up by objects lowered by hoists, elevators etc. An emergency brake is a backup braking system designed to function even when there is total brake failure. It works through purely mechanical means, and is independent of the hydraulic system which controls the brakes normally. In addition to being used in emergency situations, an emergency brake is also used as a parking brake, to prevent the car from rolling away, should it slip into gear. Like {{all parts of the}} braking system, the emergency brake should be checked regularly to ensure that it is in good working order...|$|E

40|$|Miniature {{inchworm}} actuators {{that would}} have relatively simple designs have been proposed for applications {{in which there are}} requirements for displacements of the order of microns or tens of microns and for the ability to hold their positions when electric power is not applied. The proposed actuators would be members of the class of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), but would be designed and fabricated following an approach that is somewhat unusual for MEMS. Like other MEMS actuators, the proposed inchworm actuators could utilize thermoplastic, bimetallic, shape-memory-alloy, or piezoelectric actuation principles. The figure depicts a piezoelectric inchworm actuator according to the proposal. As in other inchworm actuators, linear motion of an extensible member would be achieved by lengthening and shortening the extensible member in synchronism with alternately clamping and releasing one and then {{the other end of the}} member. In this case, the <b>moving</b> <b>member</b> would be the middle one; the member would be piezoelectric and would be shortened by applying a voltage to it. The two outer members would also be piezoelectric; the release of the clamps on the upper or lower end would be achieved by applying a voltage to the electrodes on the upper or lower ends, respectively, of these members. Usually, MEMS actuators cannot be fabricated directly on the side walls of silicon wafers, yet the geometry of this actuator necessitates such fabrication. The solution, according to the proposal, would be to use the microfabrication technique known by the German acronym LIGA - "lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung," which means lithography, electroforming, molding. LIGA involves x-ray lithography of a polymer film followed by selective removal of material to form a three-dimensional pattern from which a mold is made. Among the advantages of LIGA for this purpose are that it is applicable to a broad range of materials, can be used to implement a variety of designs, including those of structures > 1 mm high, affords submicron precision, and is amenable to mass production at relatively low unit cost. Fabrication of the proposed actuators would involve some technological risks - in particular, in the integration of electrode connection lines and placement of actuator elements. It will also be necessary to perform an intensive study of the feasibility of growing piezoelectric crystals onto LIGA molds...|$|E

This paper continues the research on graph-transformational swarms by focusing on a special type of members called stationary members. The stationary members are assigned to particular subgraphs of the considered environment graphs.

40|$|Simultaneous {{measurement}} of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and {{coefficient of friction}} (COF) at the sliding interface is essential to assess the performance of selected material contact pairs for the transfer of current from stationary member to <b>moving</b> <b>member</b> (or vice-versa). Low and stable values of ECR and COF are desirable during the intended operating life of the contact members. These parameters may change with respect to time {{as a consequence of}} change in the surface properties of contact members due to their relative movement. Hence experimental investigations have been conducted to study the variation of ECR and COF while different riders sliding on copper and brass flat samples in different environments. As a part of the experimental investigation, a reciprocating sliding setup is designed and developed to study the variation of ECR and COF in terms of normal force, sliding speed, current and environment. The details of the experimental setup are described along with its construction and operation. The sample preparation, instrumentation, data acquisition and presentation are explained in detail. The variations of ECR and COF at different normal forces, currents and sliding speeds by moving OFHC copper, brass, silver, Ag 10 Cu and Ag 20 Cu riders on OFHC copper and brass flat samples in vacuum, argon, nitrogen and air are studied in detail. Studies are also conducted to evaluate the performance of metallic contacts under lubricated condition using general purpose lubricating oils of different viscosity. Metallic contacts show a decrease in ECR with increase in normal force at all sliding speeds in all media. Sliding metallic contacts show a significant decrease in both ECR and COF during the initial sliding cycles at constant normal force in all media. Surface roughness of flat sample is found to {{have a significant effect on}} both ECR and COF in all media. Wear of rider is found to be significant as compared to wear of flat samples. Metallic contacts show an inverse relationship between ECR and COF in all media under mild wear regime (0. 2 < COF≤ 0. 4). ECR and COF of sliding metallic contacts are independent of current (≤ 4 A) in mild wear regime in all media. Reasonably low values of ECR and COF are observed for prolonged duration with lubricants having low viscosity. The presence of wear fragments at the sliding zone is found to have significant effect on both ECR and COF in all media. Low values of ECR are observed while copper rider sliding on brass sample as compared to silver rider under same operating conditions. Significant amount of metal transfer is observed with silver based riders sliding on copper and brass flat samples in different media. The present investigations are useful in understanding the contact behaviour of copper and brass flat samples for similar and dissimilar riders sliding on them in various environments...|$|E

Complex social structures are developing in societies of communicating, actively <b>moving</b> <b>members</b> such as social insects or human communities. The process goes in a similar manner regardless of the type of communication (chemical in insects, acoustic and visual in primates). Our results suggest that diet is the key factor affecting development of social structures. Evolution of complex societies has two phases, a biological and social ones. The biological phase concerns populations of individuals living in small groups which tend to spread seeking an optimum territory with reliable supply of food. Replacement of biological relations by social ones is directly proportional to the increase of population and its concentration in one place. The most complex societies, superorganisms within the species, appear in the territories climatically most favourable, with a continuous supply of food. They expel less complex societies that are less able to defend themselves to the fringes of the area with a less favourable habitat. Complex societies cannot develop until the network of social relations gets sufficiently dense due to increase of population. We found parallels between insect and human population in nutritive factors that allow a great increase of societies. They can form only after the process of adoption of plants as food evolved...|$|R
