30|$|The {{accumulation}} of {{wear and tear}} depends on DP for paper with DP <  800. For paper with higher DP, <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> appears to accumulate at a very low rate, randomly and independently of DP. In our experiments, only 2 – 5  % of wear and tear accumulated on paper with DP >  300.|$|R
30|$|For {{paper with}} DP <  300, {{at least one}} large missing piece accumulates per 100 sheets during each handling. This is {{accompanied}} by tearing and other, minor elements of <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration.</b> This value of DP could therefore {{be used as a}} safe threshold value for handling, if large missing pieces (containing text) are to be avoided.

However, {{the characteristics of}} transport and handling occurring in real historic libraries and archives vary from institution to institution, and potentially within an institution. For example, an archival folder might be retrieved from the repository, used very briefly by a reader, {{and then returned to}} the repository on the same day. Another box might be retrieved and used intensively for a week before being returned to the repository. In addition, different parts of a collection are held in different locations and produced to different reading rooms.

We also explore whether the threshold fitness for use is defined differently for objects perceived to be of different value, and for different modes of use. The data were collected in a series of fitness-for-use workshops carried out with readers/visitors in heritage institutions using principles of Design of Experiments.|$|R

40|$|Osteolytic lesions of {{the spine}} (metastasis, myeloma) can be treated {{extremely}} efficiently by percutaneous cement injection. The treatment should be restricted to osteolytic lesions of the vertebral body, and only if a relevant <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> is present.

The surgical technique is similar to the treatment of osteoporotic fractures; however, there is definitely a higher risk for cement leakage and the clinical outcome is not as predictable as in osteoporotic fracture treatment. It is important to realize that cement injection per se has no impact on the tumor itself, but provides stability to the vertebral body.

40|$|Detection {{of minor}} faults in power {{transformer}} active part is essential because minor faults may develop {{and lead to}} major faults and finally irretrievable damages occur. Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) is an effective low-voltage, off-line diagnostic tool used for finding out any possible winding displacement or <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> inside the Transformer, due to large electromechanical forces occurring from the fault currents or due to Transformer transportation and relocation. In this method, the frequency response of a transformer is taken both at manufacturing industry and concern site. Then both the response is compared to predict the fault taken place in active part. But in old aged transformers, the primary reference response is unavailable.

40|$|A {{specific}} rigid element {{approach is}} {{proposed for the}} in-plane dynamical analysis of masonry walls, whose seismic performance is strongly related to <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> and hysteretic energy dissipation. Since the execution of effective time-history analysis necessitates the use of discrete models with reduced number of degrees of freedom, the tricky issue lies in achieving a balance between accuracy in the geometrical description {{and the need for}} a realistic damage material model. For this reason, a mechanistic ``rigid body spring model'' RBSM was adopted, which consists of a collection of plane quadrilateral rigid elements connected to each other by two normal springs and one shear spring at each side. The material model was based on a phenomenological description of the cyclic response of masonry, and specific separate hysteretic laws were assigned for the axial and shear deformation between the elements. This separation led to a large reduction in computational effort, though a Coulomb-like law was adopted in order to relate the strength of the shear springs to the vertical axial loading. The effective performance of the present approach is demonstrated by the numerical validation and by comparisons with some well-known experimental and numerical tests presented in the literature...|$|R
50|$|Digital {{recording}} and reproduction converts the analog sound signal {{picked up by}} the microphone to a digital form by the process of digitization. This lets the audio data be stored and transmitted by a wider variety of media. Digital recording stores audio as a series of binary numbers (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the audio signal at equal time intervals, at a sample rate high enough to convey all sounds capable of being heard. Digital recordings are considered higher quality than analog recordings not necessarily because they have higher fidelity (wider frequency response or dynamic range), but because the digital format can prevent much loss of quality found in analog recording due to noise and electromagnetic interference in playback and <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> or damage to the storage medium. Whereas successive copies of an analog recording tend to degrade in quality, as more noise is added, a digital audio recording can be reproduced endlessly with no degradation in sound quality. A digital audio signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is amplified and connected to a loudspeaker to produce sound.|$|R

However, {{the effect of}} cellular infiltration on the mechanical properties of the tendon matrix has not been fully understood. Methods: Cultured fibroblasts derived from the rabbit patellar tendon were seeded around an acellular rabbit patellar tendon that had undergone freeze–thaw treatment. At time- 0, 3, and 6 weeks after seeding the cells, we evaluated cellular distribution in the tendon using a confocal laser microscope and the mechanical evaluations of the tendon fascicles and the tendon bundles. Findings: The confocal laser microscopic analysis showed fibroblast infiltration ex vivo into the acellular tendon matrix. We could not find significant effects of the cellular infiltration on the tangent modulus of the tendon bundle, although the ex vivo cellular infiltration significantly reduced the modulus of the tendon fascicle. In addition, the tangent modulus of the incubated tendon without fibroblasts significantly decreased with time, particularly in the tendon bundle levels. Interpretation: The {{findings of this study}} suggested that the effects of ex vivo cellular infiltration on the mechanical properties of the tendon bundles are relatively small, compared with its striking effect on the tendon fascicles...|$|R

In this study, a low strength concrete (C 20) is tested at high temperatures up to 600 °C. Specimens are thermally cycled at temperatures in the range of 400 – 300 °C, 500 – 300 °C, and 600 – 300 °C, which TES can reach in operation. For comparison, specimens also cycled at temperature in the range of 400 – 25 °C (room temperature), 500 – 25 °C, and 600 – 25 °C. It is found from the test results that cracks are not observed on the surfaces of concrete specimens until the temperature is elevated up to 500 °C. There is <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of concrete after exposure to high temperature, especially to high thermal cycles.

Un-irradiated Zircaloy- 4 cladding ring specimens charged with hydrogen were tested at various temperatures and loading conditions. Measured threshold stresses at loaded temperatures of 400 degrees C, 335 degrees C, 300 degrees C, and 235 degrees C {{turned out to be}} 60 +/- 5 MPa, 68 +/- 5 MPa, 75 +/- 6 MPa, and 90 +/- 6 MPa, respectively, demonstrating the tendency of decreasing threshold stress with increasing temperature. These stresses were lower than previously reported ones and close to the lower bound of collected data from the literature. These results reveal that high temperature preheating seems to affect an initiation of the reorientation. This implies that temperature increase caused by the vacuum drying of spent fuel assemblies for transportation can promote the hydride reorientation, leading to <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the cladding.

40|$|Pitch-based {{short-cut}} {{carbon fibers}} were treated by HNO 3 oxidation, thereafter the treated (CFN) and untreated carbon fibers (CF) {{were incorporated into}} polyimide (PI) matrix to form composites. The carbon fibers before and after treatment were examined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The friction and wear behaviors of PI composites sliding against GCr 15 steel rings were evaluated on an M- 2000 model ring-on-block test rig, which revealed that small incorporation of carbon fibers can decrease the friction coefficient and improve the wear resistance of PI composites, and that the reinforcement effect of treated carbon fibers was better {{than that of the}} untreated ones. It was found that the optimum content of carbon fibers is 15 wt% when a thin and continuous transfer film was formed on the counterpart surface during the friction process. With further increasing content of carbon fibers, the friction coefficient increased and the wear resistance reduced owing to the drop out of carbon fibers from PI matrix. Besides, the friction coefficient of the PI composites decreased and the wear resistance improved with increasing load, while for the pure PI, its wear resistance decreased drastically owing to the micro-melting and <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> caused by friction heat under a higher load...|$|R

They were Sleeve UV Transmittance (SUVT), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis (EDX). It was verified that permanent foulants were trapped initially by the inherent holes and peaks on sleeve surfaces. After long term periodical chemical/mechanical cleaning, the wipers of cleaning systems would damage sleeve surfaces severely, causing scratches or holes with wide surface areas, which may be termed <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the sleeves. Thus, foulants would be trapped more easily by these scratches, and would be attached tightly to the surfaces of these scratches or to each other. Using instrumental analyses, the compositions of permanent foulants {{were found to be}} site specific. In general, iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus composed the majority of the components of the permanent foulants. This research attempted to correlate permanent fouling to the site-specific wastewater quality.

40|$|Silicon carbide sustains {{chemical}} and <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> during tribological exposure under water lubrication. In particular, tribochemical wear {{leads to the}} formation of a thin (tens to hundreds of nanometre) layer composed of nanoscale SiC wear debris embedded in a silica-like matrix (SiOxHy) with possibly some minor oxycarbidic content. The SiC wear particles are plastically deformed and rounded as a result of mechanical tribolapping. Below that layer, subsurface damage builds up in the form of dislocations, ruptures and shear cracks. As a result of plastic deformation (similar to indentation plasticity) SiC single crystals within that transition zone are transformed into mosaic crystals with smaller domains due to slip plane gliding. Comparing results for static hydrothermal cond itions (using a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell) and tribotest for the mild and severe wear regime (i. e., with and without external cooling) we derived a qualitative wear-model of wet silicon carbide tribo-corrosion. While mechanical contact yields pathways for water inflow and generally disrupts the structural integrity of SiC grains, hydrothermal reactions of trapped water and subsequent pressure relief leads to a mechanism of dissolution and reprecipitation. The latter produces the observed amount of SiOxHy which acts as an adhesive for the SiC wear debris...|$|R
