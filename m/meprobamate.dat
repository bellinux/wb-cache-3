25|$|In January 1960, Carter Products, Inc. and American Home Products Corporation (which marketed <b>meprobamate</b> as Equanil) {{were charged}} with having conspired to monopolize the market in mild tranquilizers. It was {{revealed}} that the sale of <b>meprobamate</b> earned $40,000,000 for the defendants. Of this amount American Home Products accounted for approximately 2/3 and Carter about 1/3. The U.S. government sought an order mandating that Carter make its <b>meprobamate</b> patent available at no charge to any company desiring to use it.|$|E
25|$|In April 1965, <b>meprobamate</b> {{was removed}} from the list of tranquilizers when experts ruled that the drug was a {{sedative}} instead. The U.S. Pharmacopoeia published the ruling. At the same time the Medical Letter disclosed that <b>meprobamate</b> could be addictive at dosage levels not much above recommended. In December 1967, <b>meprobamate</b> was placed under abuse control amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Records on production and distribution were required to be kept. Limits were placed on prescription duration and refills.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of <b>meprobamate</b> {{overdose}} include: drowsiness, sluggishness, unresponsiveness, or coma; loss {{of muscle}} control; severe impairment or cessation of breathing; or shock. Death {{has been reported}} with ingestion of as little as 12 g of <b>meprobamate</b> and survival with as much as 40 g. In an overdose, <b>meprobamate</b> tablets may form a gastric bezoar, requiring physical removal of the undissolved mass of tablets through an endoscope; therefore, administration of activated charcoal should be considered even after 4 or more hours or if levels are rising.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meprobamate</b> {{overdosage}} {{is still}} a continuing problem.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meprobamate</b> is {{licensed}} for {{the short-term}} relief of anxiety, {{although it is}} not known whether the purported anti-anxiety effects of <b>meprobamate</b> are separable from its sedative effects. Its effectiveness as a selective agent for the treatment of anxiety has not been proven in humans, and is not used as often as the benzodiazepines for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Related drugs include {{carisoprodol}} and tybamate (prodrugs of <b>meprobamate),</b> felbamate, mebutamate, and methocarbamol.|$|E
25|$|Production {{continued}} {{throughout the}} 1960s, but by 1970 <b>meprobamate</b> {{was listed as}} a controlled substance after it was discovered to cause physical and psychological dependence.|$|E
25|$|An acute {{cerebral}} edema {{caused by}} a reaction to Equagesic, a combination of aspirin and <b>meprobamate,</b> {{is believed to have}} caused the death of Bruce Lee.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meprobamate,</b> 2-methyl-2-propyl-1,3-propandiol dicarbamate is {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of 2-methylvaleraldehyde with two molecules of formaldehyde and the subsequent transformation of the resulting 2-methyl-2-propylpropan-1,3-diol into the dicarbamate via successive reactions with phosgene and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{marketed as}} being safer, <b>meprobamate</b> has {{most of the}} {{pharmacological}} effects and dangers of the barbiturates and acts at the barbiturate binding site (though it is less sedating at effective doses). It {{is reported to have}} some anticonvulsant properties against absence seizures, but can exacerbate generalized tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meprobamate</b> — {{marketed as}} Miltown by Wallace Laboratories and Equanil by Wyeth, among others — is a {{carbamate}} derivative {{used as an}} anxiolytic drug. It was the best-selling minor tranquilizer for a time, but has largely {{been replaced by the}} benzodiazepines due to their wider therapeutic index (lower risk of toxicity at therapeutically prescribed doses) and lower incidence of serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health {{stated that}} <b>meprobamate,</b> glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, {{methyprylon}} and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness {{can hardly be}} questioned. However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E
2500|$|Meprobamate's {{mechanism}} of action is not completely known. It {{has been shown in}} animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. <b>Meprobamate</b> binds to GABAA receptors which interrupts neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain. It has been shown that <b>meprobamate</b> has the ability to activate currents {{even in the absence of}} GABA. [...] This relatively unique property makes <b>meprobamate</b> exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent adenosine reuptake inhibitor (AdoRI), ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 19, 2012, the European Medicines Agency withdrew {{marketing}} authorization in the European Union for all medicines containing <b>meprobamate,</b> [...] "due {{to serious}} side effects seen with the medicine." [...] The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) [...] "concluded {{that the benefits of}} <b>meprobamate</b> do not outweigh its risks." [...] In October 2013, Canada also withdrew marketing authorization.|$|E
2500|$|A December 1955 {{study of}} 101 {{patients}} at the Mississippi State Hospital in Whitfield, Mississippi, found <b>meprobamate</b> useful in the alleviation of [...] "mental symptoms." [...] Three {{percent of the patients}} made a complete recovery, 29% were greatly improved, and 50% were somewhat better. Eighteen percent realized little change. Self-destructive patients became cooperative and calmer, and experienced a resumption of logical thinking. In 50% of the cases relaxation brought about more favorable sleep habits. Hydrotherapy and all types of shock treatment were halted. <b>Meprobamate</b> was found to help in the treatment of alcoholics by 1956. By 1957, over 36 million prescriptions had been filled for <b>meprobamate</b> in the US alone, a billion pills had been manufactured, and it accounted for fully a third of all prescriptions written.|$|E
2500|$|... tranquilizers {{suppressed}} it. A University of Michigan {{study found}} that <b>meprobamate</b> affected driving skills. Though patients reported being able to relax more easily, <b>meprobamate</b> did not completely alleviate their tense feelings. The disclosures came at a special scientific meeting at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York City, at which Aldous Huxley addressed an evening session. He predicted the development of many chemicals [...] "capable of changing the quality of human consciousness", {{in the next few}} years.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Meprobamate,</b> like barbiturates, {{possesses}} an analgesic/anesthetic potential. It is {{also found}} {{as a component of}} the combination analgesic [...] "Stopayne" [...] capsules (along with paracetamol (acetaminophen), caffeine, and codeine phosphate).|$|E
2500|$|... "In the January 2008 {{issue of}} Drug Safety Update, a Stop press article {{announced}} the recent European review of carisoprodol {{for which the}} Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. This review was triggered by concerns from the Norwegian Medical Agency that carisoprodol (converted to <b>meprobamate</b> after administration) was associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment." [...] February 2008.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Meprobamate</b> is a Schedule IV drug (US) (S5 in South Africa) {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances. [...] With {{protracted}} use {{it can cause}} physical dependence and a potentially life-threatening abstinence syndrome {{similar to that of}} barbiturates and alcohol (delerium tremens). For this reason, discontinuation is often achieved through an extended regimen of slowly decreasing doses over a period of weeks, or even months. Alternatively, the patient may be switched to a longer-acting gabaergic agent such as diazepam (in a manner similar to the use of methadone therapy for opiate addiction) before attempting de-titration.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include <b>meprobamate,</b> barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1940s, Frank Milan Berger {{was working}} in a {{laboratory}} of a British drug company, looking for a preservative for penicillin, when he noticed that a compound called mephenesin had a sedative effect in laboratory rodents. Berger subsequently referred to this sedating or “tranquilizing” effect in a now-historic article, published by The British Journal of Pharmacology in 1946. However, there were three major drawbacks {{to the use of}} mephenesin as a tranquilizer: a very short duration of action, greater effect on the spinal cord than on the brain, and a weak activity. In May 1950, after moving to Carter Products in New Jersey, Berger and a chemist, Bernard John Ludwig, synthesized a chemically related tranquilizing compound, <b>meprobamate,</b> that was able to overcome these three drawbacks. [...] Wallace Laboratories, a subsidiary of Carter Products, bought the license and named their new product [...] "Miltown" [...] after the borough of Milltown in New Jersey. Launched in 1955, it rapidly became the first blockbuster psychotropic drug in American history, becoming popular in Hollywood and gaining notoriety for its seemingly miraculous effects. It has since been marketed under more than 100 trade names, from Amepromat through Quivet to Zirpon.|$|E

50|$|Most {{anxiolytic}} agents are minor tranquilizers, the founding compound {{of which was}} <b>meprobamate,</b> marketed in the United States as Miltown. <b>Meprobamate</b> was eventually eclipsed by the benzodiazepines. The target of both categories of anxiotropic compounds is the GABAA receptor.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, certain carbamates (ex. carisoprodol, <b>meprobamate,</b> lorbamate), thienodiazepines, ethanol (alcohol), etomidate, glutethimide, kavalactones, <b>meprobamate,</b> quinazolinones (ex. methaqualone, etaqualone, diproqualone), neuroactive steroids, niacin/niacinamide, nonbenzodiazepines (ex. zolpidem, eszopiclone), propofol, stiripentol, theanine, valerenic acid, volatile/inhaled anesthetics, and lanthanum.|$|E
5000|$|Carisoprodol is metabolized into <b>meprobamate.</b> Until 2012, {{carisoprodol}} was not {{a controlled}} substance in the United States, but <b>meprobamate</b> was classified as a potentially addictive controlled substance that can produce dangerous and painful withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E

50|$|Marketed as a safer {{alternative}} to barbiturate anxiolytics, <b>meprobamate</b> (Miltown, Equanil) was {{commonly used to}} relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s.
