5|$|My {{place is}} with the guns! You will {{maintain}} the division for <b>me.</b> <b>From</b> time to time we will speak by telephone or radio. If we have an understanding on this, everything will be good. If not, then {{you will have to}} go.|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know <b>me</b> <b>from</b> pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act â€“ for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my life, that you grant to <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E

5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited <b>me</b> <b>from</b> time to time in my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

25|$|I lost my job, my house, my {{wife and}} {{children}} because it all became too much for me... Today I feel under great stress again because the establishment is mounting a campaign against me.

25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for <b>me</b> <b>from</b> that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E

25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep <b>me</b> <b>from</b> 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
25|$|Signing with Indianola Records {{for their}} first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was {{replaced}} by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates <b>Me</b> <b>from</b> You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. Since 2011, the band {{has been involved in}} a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, that month. In 2016, the band released their sixth album, Bad Vibrations.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented <b>me</b> <b>from</b> preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the deYoung family's Chronicle Publishing Company unit {{discussed}} a possible trade of KRON-TV (for $100 million) to the Gannett Company, {{in exchange for}} acquiring Gannett's Oklahoma City station KOCO-TV. The proposal ultimately fell apart by September 1983. In the late 1980s, KRON-TV was among the few local television stations in the United States that produced a game show: Claim to Fame was a weekly half-hour show hosted by Patrick Van Horn that usually ran on Saturday evenings. During that timeframe, KRON also produced a Saturday morning children's program called Buster and <b>Me.</b> <b>From</b> the 1970s into the late 1980s, the station used Gabriel FaurÃ©'s Pavane, Opus 50 as the music piece played during its nightly sign-off, alongside scenic rustic shots from around the Bay Area. KRON also produced Bay Area Backroads, a half-hour program (which ran from the mid-1980s to 2008) that profiled places {{and people in the}} greater San Francisco Bay Area, and occasionally beyond. The program, which generally aired on Sunday evenings, featured hosts such as Jerry Graham and Doug McConnell.|$|E
