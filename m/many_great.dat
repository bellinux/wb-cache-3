5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to <b>many</b> <b>great</b> advances.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of <b>many</b> <b>great</b> estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply.

Favaloro graduated with a medical degree in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{research}} {{points out}} some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early {{origins of the}} Polish state in Greater Poland. There are indications that the processes {{that led to the}} establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the Great Moravian state caused by the Magyar invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, <b>many</b> <b>Great</b> Moravian people, fearing for their lives, had to escape. According to the notes made by Constantine VII, they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in Sołacz graves in Poznań have their counterparts in burial sites around Nitra in Slovakia. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Poznań town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands.|$|E

5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} <b>many</b> <b>great</b> events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
