5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the <b>mid-back</b> area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides.

25|$|He {{was placed}} on the 10-day DL on July 25, {{retroactive}} to July 23, due to <b>mid-back</b> tightness. Wainwright was leading the Cardinals with 11 wins and had posted a 4.89 ERA in his 20 games started, striking out 95 batters in 110.1 innings pitched. This marked just the fourth time in his career that Wainwright has been disabled: 2008 for right middle finger sprain, 2011 for right elbow Tommy John surgery, and 2015 for a ruptured right Achilles. He came back {{towards the end of the}} season appearing in 4 games, 3 of them starts. Overall, Wainwright finished the season with the highest single season ERA of his career, finishing with an ERA of 5.11 in 23 starts.|$|E
40|$|The anti-tumorigenic {{effects of}} Toxoplasma gondii (RH) antigens were studied in a murine sarcoma- 180 tumor model. To {{determine}} the anti-tumor effects, {{the reduction in}} tumor size and expression of CD 31 (an angiogenesis marker in the tumor tissue) were examined after injection of BALB/c mice with T. gondii lysate antigen (TLA) or formalin-fixed, proliferation-inhibited, T. gondii tachyzoites. Tumors were successfully produced by an intradermal injection of sarcoma- 180 cells with plain Matrigel in the <b>mid-backs</b> of mice. After injection with TLA or formalin-fixed T. gondii tachyzoites, the increase in tumor size and weight nearly stopped while tumor growth continued in control mice that were injected with PBS. CD 31 expression in TLA-treated or formalin-fixed T. gondii-injected mice was lower than the control mice. Accordingly, the present study shows that the treatment of mice with formalin-fixed T. gondii or TLA in the murine sarcoma- 180 tumor model results in a decrease of both tumor size and CD 31 expression...|$|R
25|$|Lorica hamata was {{a type of}} mail armour {{used during}} the Roman Republic {{continuing}} throughout the Roman Empire as a standard-issue armour for the primary heavy infantry legionaries and secondary troops (auxilia). They were mostly manufactured out of iron, though sometimes bronze was used instead. The rings were linked together, alternating closed washer-like rings with riveted rings. This produced a very flexible, reliable and strong armour. Each ring had an inside diameter of between 5 and 7mm, and an outside diameter of 7 to 9mm. The shoulders of the lorica hamata had flaps that {{were similar to those}} of the Greek linothorax; they ran from about <b>mid-back</b> to the front of the torso, and were connected by brass or iron hooks which connected to studs riveted through the ends of the flaps. Several thousand rings would have gone into one lorica hamata.|$|E
2500|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from <b>mid-back</b> to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced [...] through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striped hyena}} is a {{primarily}} nocturnal animal, which typically only leaves its den {{at the onset}} of total darkness, returning before sunrise. Striped hyenas typically live in groups of 1–2 animals, though groups of up to seven animals are known in Libya. They are generally not territorial animals, with home ranges of different groups often overlapping each other. Home ranges in the Serengheti have been recorded to be -, while one in the Negev was calculated at [...] When marking their territory, striped hyenas use the paste of their anal pouch (hyena butter) to scent mark grass, stalks, stones, tree trunks and other objects. In aggressive encounters, the black patch near the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is erected. When fighting, striped hyenas will bite at the throat and legs, but avoid the mane, which serves as a signalling device. When greeting each other, they lick the <b>mid-back</b> region, sniff each other's noses, extrude their anal pouch or paw each other's throats. The species is not as vocal as the spotted hyena, its vocalisations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling.|$|E
