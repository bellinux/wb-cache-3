50|$|The Callows are a {{classified}} as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Irish Wildlife Trust has a reserve on Bullock Island. Protection of the Callows is particularly important due to the many species of birds occurring on the Callows. Recorded are, amongst others, black-tailed godwit, corncrake, curlew, golden plover, lapwing, mute swan, redshank, sandpiper, whooper swan and wigeon. Mammals recorded include American mink, fox and otter. Grazing of cattle keeps alder and willow from spreading. Sections of Callow at higher elevation and therefore less prone to flooding have a greater diversity of plants, in particular clover, creeping buttercup, cuckoo flower, marsh bedstraw, <b>marsh</b> marigold, <b>meadow</b> <b>grass,</b> meadowsweet, sedge and water mint.|$|R

40|$|The {{vesicular-arbuscular}} mycorrhizal fungus Glomus monosporum was inoculated on grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense), <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) and onion (Allium cepa) as hosts in two experiments {{carried out in}} different environments. Grapevine and clover showed the largest growth response and spore production. Mycorrhizal infection was lowest in <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Very poor correlations were observed, on an overall basis, between spore production and per cent root infection or infected root length. Spore production per unit infected root length for each host species was a comparatively stable parameter; it was largest for grapevine and smallest for <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> in both experiments. Sporulation {{was positively correlated with}} growth enhancement by mycorrhizal plants, and growth increments per unit infected root followed the same trend as spore numbers per unit infected root, i. e. largest for grapevine and lowest for meadow-grass. It is concluded that the ability of G. monosporum to produce spores and to enhance plant growth per unit infected root length depends on the host plant species...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{wastewater}} is consideredas effluents, {{which are}} formed {{on the surface}} of urbanized areas. Stormwater treatment is performed out using a variety of filters: sand, grass. Wastewater penetration into the deeper layers is called hydraulic conductivity. After evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity, it is possible to determine the ability of the investigated fillers to entrap the stormwater flow. The hydraulic conductivity tests can indicate which fillers of stormwater filters may influence the more effective stormwater cleaning. Four stormwater filters were tested: crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter; crushed autoclaved aerated concrete with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter. Under in-situ conditions hydraulic conductivity in filters is investigated using Constant-head method. Mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D presentsthe changes of hydraulic conductivity in each filler layer of the filter. Assessed hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions hasn‘t changed only in crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter (30 000 mm/d). The smallest hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions was estimated in silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer, here it was equal to 209. 3 mm/d. With mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D {{it was found that the}} hydraulic conductivity in each filter decreases, depending on the depth of filler in the filter...|$|R
