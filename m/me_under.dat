500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept <b>me</b> <b>under</b> contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E

During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{addition}} {{provided by the}} Glenmasan manuscript to the Táin Bó Flidhais is the precursor story {{of the death of}} the sons of Uisnech. Conchobar mac Nessa sends Fergus mac Róich to bring the sons of Uisnech back from exile in Scotland so that they might help Conchobar 'defend the province of Ulster against every other province in Ireland.' Dierdre has an ill-omened dream that her husband Naisi, son of Uisnech, will be betrayed. Fergus insists he will let no harm come to them. Naisi trusts Fergus and the sons of Uisnech return to Ireland. They arrive at Borrach's fortress, where Fergus is immediately put under a Geas. ‘I have a feast for you, Fergus,’ said Borrach, ‘and it is a tabu of yours to leave a feast until it is ended.’ ‘You have done ill, Borrach,’ said Fergus, ‘to put <b>me</b> <b>under</b> prohibitions, seeing that Conchobar made me pledge my word to bring the sons of Uisnech to Emain on the day that they should come to Ireland.’ ‘I put you under prohibitions,’ said Borrach, ‘prohibitions that true heroes suffer you not to escape unless you come to consume that feast.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took <b>me</b> <b>under</b> her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E

2500|$|Outside the {{critical}} reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter {{is built around}} the polemic between Gârbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, {{over the issue of}} what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as sal (for salut, [...] "hello"), vb (vorbim, [...] "we'll talk") and ms (mersi, [...] "thanks"). Gârbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: [...] " [...] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When I call him using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability.

2500|$|ZZ Top's next {{album was}} even more successful. Eliminator, {{released}} in March 1983, featured two top 40 singles ("Gimme All Your Lovin'" [...] and [...] "Legs"), and two additional Top Rock hits ("Got <b>Me</b> <b>Under</b> Pressure" [...] and [...] "Sharp Dressed Man"), with [...] "Legs" [...] peaking at no. 13 on the Club Play Singles chart. Eliminator was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies, and several music videos were in regular rotation on MTV. The band also won their first MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Group Video for [...] "Legs", and Best Direction for [...] "Sharp Dressed Man". The music videos were included in their Greatest Hits video, which was later released on DVD and quickly went multiple-platinum. However, the Eliminator album was not without controversy. According to former stage manager David Blayney in his book [...] "Sharp Dressed Men", sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album while serving as a live-in high-tech music teacher to Beard and Gibbons. Despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song [...] "Thug".|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi revealed he attempted to brake as late as possible to prevent Vergne from overtaking him {{at the start of}} the race but had used more electrical energy than expected when he established an advantage. He stated that he lost some time under full course yellow conditions but when Vergne retired, he [...] "was having a nice time, as he was putting <b>me</b> <b>under</b> pressure." [...] Buemi believed the victory would not have happened if his team had not made repairs to his car's powertrain in their technical headquarters in Viry-Châtillon. However he felt his team deserved the victory more than him due to them overcoming the preceding year's problems with track conditions. López said from the beginning of the season, his car was good, but was not yet experienced enough to be competitive. However, he stated his team [...] "worked hard" [...] in the event at a track which he liked and felt it played a role in his second-place result. Third-place finisher Heidfeld stated it felt [...] "great" [...] to have achieved his second consecutive podium result, and that it was [...] "another exciting race", and his team were more competitive than they were in Monaco. He said it was [...] "a great result" [...] for Mahindra, and that they would not stop until they had achieved their objective of securing their first victory.|$|E
