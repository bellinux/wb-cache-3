40|$|Both {{experiments}} and theoretical {{studies have demonstrated}} that the interaction between the current carrying electrons and the induced polarization charge in single-molecule junctions leads to a strong renormalization of molecular charging energies. However, the effect on electronic excitations and <b>molecular</b> <b>symmetries</b> remain unclear. Using a theoretical framework developed for semiconductor nanostructure based single-electron transistors (SETs), we demonstrate that the image charge interaction breaks the <b>molecular</b> <b>symmetries</b> in a benzene based single-molecule transistor operating in the Coulomb blockade regime. This results in the appearance of a so-called blocking state, which gives rise to negative differential resistance (NDR). We show that the appearance of NDR and its magnitude in the symmetry-broken benzene SET depends in a complicated way on the interplay between the many-body matrix elements, the lead tunnel coupling asymmetry, and the bias polarity. In particular, the current reducing property of the blocking state causing the NDR, is shown to vanish under strongly asymmetric tunnel couplings, when the molecule is coupled stronger to the drain electrode. The calculated IV characteristic may serve as an indicator for image charge broken <b>molecular</b> <b>symmetries</b> in experimental situations. Comment: Accepted version (Phys. Rev.

25|$|Benzene, {{the model}} π system, has no {{permanent}} dipole moment, as {{the contributions of}} the weakly polar carbon–hydrogen bonds cancel due to <b>molecular</b> <b>symmetry.</b> However, the electron-rich π system above and below the benzene ring hosts a partial negative charge. A counterbalancing positive charge is associated with the plane of the benzene atoms, resulting in an electric quadrupole (a pair of dipoles, aligned like a parallelogram so there is no net molecular dipole moment). The negatively charged region of the quadrupole can then interact favorably with positively charged species; a particularly strong effect is observed with cations of high charge density.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high <b>molecular</b> <b>symmetry</b> {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds.

Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines.
