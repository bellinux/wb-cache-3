40|$|This paper applies {{categories}} {{developed in}} the classic literature on political opposition to the developing European Union. It {{is clear that the}} EU has never developed the third great milestone identified by Dahl in his analysis of the path to democratic institutions. That is, we still lack the capacity to organize opposition within the European polity. This failure to allow for opposition within the polity is likely to lead either (a) to the elimination of opposition altogether, or (b) to the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opposition <b>of</b> principle against the EU polity. This problem is also beginning to reach down into the domestic sphere, in that the growing weight of the EU, through its indirect impact on national politics, helps to encourage domestic democratic deficits, hence limiting the scope for classical opposition at the national level. Here too, then, we might expect to see either the elimination of opposition or the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new - perhaps populist - opposition of principle...|$|R

40|$|Burkholderia cenocepacia {{is both a}} plant {{pathogen}} {{and the cause of}} serious opportunistic infections, particularly in cystic fibrosis patients. B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2 harbors a native plasmid named Ptw for its involvement in the Plant Tissue Watersoaking phenotype. Ptw has also been reported to be important for survival in human cells. Interestingly, the presence <b>of</b> PtwC, <b>a</b> homolog <b>of</b> the conjugative relaxase TrwC of plasmid R 388, suggests a possible function for Ptw in conjugative DNA transfer. The ptw region includes Type IV Secretion System genes related to those of the F plasmid. However, genes in the adjacent region shared stronger homology with the R 388 genes involved in conjugative DNA metabolism. This region included the putative relaxase ptwC, a putative coupling protein and accessory nicking protein, and a DNA segment with high number of inverted repeats and elevated AT content, suggesting a possible oriT. Although we were unable to detect conjugative transfer of the Ptw resident plasmid, we detected conjugal <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> co-resident plasmid containing the ptw region homologous to R 388, demonstrating the cloned ptw region contains an oriT. A similar plasmid lacking ptwC could not be mobilized, suggesting that the putative relaxase PtwC must act in cis on its oriT. Remarkably, we also detected <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plasmid containing the Ptw oriT by the R 388 relaxase TrwC, yet we could not detect PtwC-mediated <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> R 388 oriT-containing plasmid. Our data unambiguously show that the Ptw plasmid harbors DNA transfer functions, and suggests the Ptw plasmid may play a dual role in horizontal DNA transfer and eukaryotic infection.

40|$|The drainage-induced {{oxidation}} of iron-sulfide minerals in acid-sulfate soils has {{adversely affected}} {{large areas of}} coastal floodplains. Re-flooding of these soils, via the re-establishment of more natural drainage regimes, is a potential remediation approach. Here we describe the mobility <b>of</b> Al, <b>As,</b> Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn during controlled re-flooding <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Fe- and organic-rich acid-sulfate soil material. Soil re-flooding caused the onset of microbially-mediated Fe(III) -reduction, which raised the pH of the initially acidic (pH 3. 4) soil to pH 6. 0 to 6. 5, thereby immobilizing Al. The process of Fe(III) -reduction released high concentrations of FeII and was associated with significant <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>As.</b> During {{the early stages of}} re-flooding, FeII mobility was controlled by dissolution of schwertmannite (Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 6 SO 4) with an ion activity product (IAP) of 1019 ± 2. The mobility of FeII was subsequently controlled by the precipitation of siderite (FeCO 3) with an IAP spanning 10 − 10 to 10 − 7. 5. The formation of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), as <b>a</b> product <b>of</b> SO 4 -reduction, further retarded the mobility of FeII. Interactions with AVS also strongly immobilized Mn, Ni and Zn, yet had little effect on As which remained relatively mobile in the re-flooded soil. This study shows that the <b>mobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>As</b> and Fe during soil re-flooding should be considered when planning remediation approaches for acid-sulfate soils...|$|R
