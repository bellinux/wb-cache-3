40|$|An {{increasing}} interest in natural materials, connecting with so-called comeback {{of man to}} nature, couses an increasing consumption of raw-materials for their production. One {{of the most important}} resorts producing these source is agriculture. The growing of so-called alternative plants on arable soil for following processing in non-food industry, firstly provides renewable sources for processing industry and secondly it also solves a problem of agricultural overproduction in Western Europe. Flax surely belongs to a group of alternative plants. The traditional technology of growing, harvesting and processing consist in the long flax fibre production for production of natural, flax fabrics. New non-traditional technologies produce short fibre for production of <b>mixed</b> <b>yarn</b> (cotton-flax), but also for non-textile processing (building materials, plastic materials, biodegradable products and packing). The aim of this work was to do practical field testing of parameters of newly imported machinery for two-phase harvesting technology, and also test possibilities of using of non-traditional harvesting technologies and following processing. The field testing of imported machinery showed that this machinery operates with high quality of work, especially precise putting straws on the line. The measured figures in the field testing of the quality of desseding is not always satisfactory. The main reason of the high losses (20, 69 %) I assume, is incorrect adjustment of the machinery. Calculated efficiencies of measured machinery in the field testing failed to reach maximum values given by manufacturer of machinery. For the judging of non-traditional technology we choosed technique, which did not need any additional investment costs. This technique used machinery for harvesting stemmed materials. We compared two variants: one with moving and second with pulling. For deseeding we used combine harvester with picking adapter. Straws were during retting two times turned and on the end pressed to the gig square bales. The gained wirr-straw was processed on the tow processing line. The better variant was the mowing. The retted straw yield was lower (4, 11 %) and the seed yield was higher (25, 52 %) in compare with the variant of the puling. The harvest costs of the mowing variant are also more profitable (4 995 Ck per ha) while the costs of the pulling method were higher (5 941 Ck per ha) and the average costs of the traditional harvest technology were 6809 Ck per ha. In my opinion the non-traditional harvesting technology should be used in case of flax being of lower quality or damaged. In these cases not even the use of the new and powerful machinery can ensure production of first-rate-flax, which attracts costumers. On the other hand a little decline of retted straw quality means huge depreciation the price. The saved costs in non-traditional harvesting technology can compensate lower trade price. Because the Czech Republic wants to enter EU it is necessary to continue in subvention of growing flax, the subsidy in EU is 815 ECU per hectareAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{thrust of}} the study is to compare {{different}} design principles for advanced creation of full-fashioned weaving. According to the present integrated design mode, three technical elements of weaving design have been identified in the course of creation, i. e. <b>mixed</b> <b>yarns,</b> integrated structures, and integrated patterns. The design process is the key to successful integrated design, including allocation of materials of warp and weft, different interlacing locations that suitable for clothing structures, and the method of patterning in the current CAD digital processing. The entire design mode is different from the previous laminar woven textile designs. Experiments have shown that, with the shapeable materials, the fine silk yarns are perfect to weave and mould the three dimensional dress for women. Besides, rich and novel textures can be embellished inherently on the surfaces of the full-fashion woven clothing. The expanded creative dimensions of woven textiles contributed an added value to silk products produced by current machines. Meanwhile the new features of Seamless Woven Fashion (SWF) further widened the creative scope of fashion design. The study has contributed to the future research and development of advanced woven textiles as the end products...|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} Jamawar has {{decreased}} {{due to the}} modern pressures of cost benefits and mass production. Pure silk {{is no longer a}} feasible option for most weavers, who now employ a mix thread of silk combined with other <b>mixed</b> <b>yarns</b> including silk and wool, silk and cotton, silk and viscose. In areas even where these weavers still employ pure silk, they are making only razor thin profits and thus most have discontinued the work by not training new workers and letting the family owned businesses die out, as offspring choose alternative professions to follow. The reason for the low profits of weavers {{has to do with the}} supply chain. Makers of Jamawar have to keep their costs low to sell to the majority of the consumers who cannot afford the cloth at higher prices. This means that the weaver suffers most, since they come last in the supply chain and cannot afford to be out of work and plus cannot dictate the price at which they will weave the cloth due to the almost monopoly of the few fixed designers cum wholesalers who dictate the market.|$|R

40|$|The main physical-mechanical {{properties}} of the yarns are: linear density (Tex), tensile strength, tenacity, elongation at break, twisting and mechanical work of fracture, {{there is a strong}} correlation between them. The tensile properties are the basic characteristics of yarns, influencing how they behave in the technological processes of mechanical processing (preparation for weaving or knitting, proper weaving or knitting) determining the technological parameters of equipment adjusting during the technological processes and also their productivity. The tensile {{properties of}} yarns constitute qualitative characteristics, because their value depends {{on the quality of the}} yarn and also on the finite product obtained from processing yarns. In this paper was done a comparative study of the tensile properties of two batches of <b>mixed</b> woolen <b>yarns</b> (wool with polyester and wool with polyamide), the mixture being in the same proportions, but the yarns have different fineness and have very close twist values, both batches of yarns were designed for knitted products.

The paper presents {{the context of the}} use of textiles within the construction industry. It also discusses the strength of using designers as lead researchers in applied science projects, in place of engineers and scientists. The sensor, provided by Nanoforce from Queen Mary University of London, consists of thermoplastic polyurethane fibres containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes extruded as a yarn. This was woven into multiple fabric samples using varying weaves and <b>mix</b> of <b>yarns.</b> The samples were tested for consistency in stability of the conduction of the data. The most stable samples were rewoven and set within a resin skin to form a composite material that could later be applied to a building structure. In this paper we evaluate our methodology firstly by analysing the data taken from the initial samples to establish stability of the data acquisition and ascertain the best weave pattern and choice of yarns. Secondly by applying the weave to a resin skin to explore a viable composite material that could be applied to a construction joint within the building industry...|$|R
40|$|In many daily contexts, {{we prefer}} natural ‘materials’ over un-natural ones. Textiles {{embodied}} in garments that are worn {{on the body}} all day, or in bed sheets slept under every night touch us literally, on a daily basis. Hence among all other materials, ‘naturalness perception’ has a strong impact on the preference for textile products. Nevertheless, a stark gap {{can be found in}} literature articulating when people appraise textiles as natural. Grounding on previously conducted studies on textile perception, we present an empirical study in which we determined three main aspects which might influence the perception of naturalness in textiles: (1) fiber origin, what it is actually made of (natural vs. artificial, or <b>mixed),</b> (2) <b>yarn</b> type (fine vs. thick yarn), (3) exploration mode, i. e. how people interact with textiles (e. g. touch only, vision only, both). The results show that pure wool and pure cotton textiles are perceived most natural. While mixing wool and cotton with polypropylene destroys the perception of naturalness, mixing in acrylic does not. Moreover, a thick yarn is perceived as most natural. No differences were found for exploration modality. We discuss our results in the light of design in textiles.

30|$|Merchant-manufacturers in Norwich, a {{major centre}} for textile {{production}} in England, used pattern books and pattern cards containing swatches of worsted and worsted <b>mixed</b> with other <b>yarns</b> to facilitate sales and trade. Studying such well-preserved and dated materials provides valuable {{information that can}} translate into informed decisions {{for the care of}} Norwich textile collections. Using a Norwich pattern book from Winterthur Museum’s Special Collections dated c. 1790 – 1793, we report the first stage of a substantial study that combines spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques with archival research. A combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC–PDA) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) allowed for identification of characteristic mordants like iron and tin salts; and dyes, like quercitron, native to North America. In addition, a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) allowed for partial identification of the glazed finish in some textiles as a natural gum. Setting the foundations for future conservation and conservation science work, our research contributes to the care of these important and beautiful textiles, by providing scientific evidence for humidity and/or light sensitive constituent materials.|$|R

In modern Jacquard weaving, the application of yarn color variety is limited to electronic Jacquard machinery and realizing a wide scope of weave colors can be challenging. Therefore, when reproducing a pictorial image with a small yarn variety, artwork colors are defined by a CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) system and its primary color data are used to associate with weave structures. In alignment with a CMYK pattern layout, shaded weave structures are incorporated to expand the accessible gamut of weave colors and natural shading is realized by different cover factors in the warp and weft. The mixing effect of CMYK yarns is intended for resolving the technical limitations of current digital Jacquard weaving. In this study, quantitative research is designed to examine four <b>yarn</b> <b>mixing</b> effects for which pairs of CMYK yarns are superimposed (e. g., [C]+[M], [C]+[Y], [M]+[Y], [C]+[K], [M]+[K], [Y]+[K]) and 90 different weave colors are produced in six groups. Once they are formatted in a standardized size, weave samples are measured by a spectrophotometer and analyzed by three coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) of a CIELAB color system. As shown by the analysis results, the weave colors bear not only varied brightness, hue, and chroma alternations, but also a great similarity to the pigment mixing effect. In application of the color mixing effect, {{a new way of}} woven color presentation is achieved and introduced as a new development of Jacquard design...|$|R
