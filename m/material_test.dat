"In {{considering}} {{the scale and}} plan on which my friend's instruction should be carried out" [...] (I quote, with the change of a word or two, from my Introduction of 1899), [...] "it seemed necessary to take into account, not his own always modest opinion of himself, but the place which he seemed likely to take ultimately in the world's regard. The {{four or five years}} following the death of a writer much applauded in his lifetime are generally the years when the decline of his reputation begins, if it is going to suffer decline at all. At present, certainly, Stevenson's name seems in no danger of going down. On the stream of daily literary reference and allusion it floats more actively than ever. In another sense its vitality is confirmed by the <b>material</b> <b>test</b> of continued sales and of the market. Since we have lost him other writers, whose beginnings he watched with sympathetic interest, have come to fill a greater immediate place in public attention; but none has exercised Stevenson's peculiar and personal power to charm, to attach, and to inspirit. By his study of perfection in form and style--qualities for which his countrymen in general have been apt to care little--he might seem destined to give pleasure chiefly to the fastidious and the artistically minded. But as to its matter, the main appeal of his work is not to any mental tastes and fashions of the few; it is rather to universal, hereditary instincts, to the primitive sources of imaginative excitement and entertainment in the race.|$|E
6000|$|These three tendencies cohere, or are cohering, in an {{institution}} which is not without a great historical basis and not without great modern conveniences. And as France was the standard-bearer of citizenship in 1798, Germany is the standard-bearer of this alternative solution in 1915. The institution which our fathers called Slavery fits in with, or rather logically flows from, all the three spirits of which I have spoken, and promises great advantages to each of them. It can give the individual worker everything except the power to alter the State--that is, his own status. Finality (or what certain eleutheromaniacs would call hopelessness) of status is the soul of Slavery--and of Compulsory Insurance. Then again, Germany gives the individual exactly the liberty {{that has always been}} given to a slave--the liberty to think, the liberty to dream, the liberty to rage; the liberty to indulge in any intellectual hypotheses about the unalterable world and state--such as have always been free to slaves, from the stoical maxims of Epictetus to the skylarking fairy tales of Uncle Remus. And it has been truly urged by all defenders of slavery that, if history has merely a <b>material</b> <b>test,</b> the material condition of the subordinate under slavery tends to be good rather than bad. When I once pointed out how precisely the [...] "model village" [...] of a great employer reproduces the safety and seclusion of an old slave estate, the employer thought it quite enough to answer indignantly that he had provided baths, playing-grounds, a theatre, etc., for his workers. He would probably have thought it odd to hear a planter in South Carolina boast that he had provided banjos, hymn-books, and places suitable for the cake-walk. Yet the planter must have provided the banjos, for a slave cannot own property. And if this Germanic sociology is indeed to prevail among us, I think some of the broad-minded thinkers who concur in its prevalence owe something like an apology to many gallant gentlemen whose graves lie where the last battle was fought in the Wilderness; men who had the courage to fight for it, the courage to die for it and, above all, the courage to call it by its name.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturing {{standards}} for pipes commonly require {{a test of}} chemical composition {{and a series of}} mechanical strength tests for each heat of pipe. A heat of pipe is all forged from the same cast ingot, and therefore had the same chemical composition.

The manufacturer performs these tests and reports the composition in a mill traceability report and the mechanical tests in a <b>material</b> <b>test</b> report, both of which are referred to by the acronym MTR.
