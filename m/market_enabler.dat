40|$|With the {{telephony}} {{business world}} focusing on Voice over IP (VoIP), numerous IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) vendors are offering rich new product lines supporting VoIP capabilities, presence integration, and other enhanced multimedia and location-based services. In {{order to achieve}} true convergence of these technologies, PBX, phone and network vendors will need to design and support products that will interoperate with each other based upon industry standards.

However, SIP's extensibility has also introduced interoperability challenges as vendors differentiate by extending beyond baseline SIP specifications. Implementation of rich features in a standard, interoperable manner requires ongoing standardization and industry consensus...|$|E
