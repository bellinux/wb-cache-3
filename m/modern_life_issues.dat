40|$|The lack {{of local}} {{literature}} bedevilled African and Nigerian literatures {{for a long}} time. This contributed {{in no small measure}} to a few critics averring that Africa and Nigeria lack literature of any major type especially of the traditional form. The twentieth century Onitsha Market Literature in Nigeria which came in pamphlets, novellas, and chap-books is just an example to disprove this assertion. Within this traditional but regional literature is a compilation of oral literary sourced works and documented solutions to <b>modern</b> <b>life</b> <b>issues.</b> It is a potpourri of life experiences of Nigerians within the colonial and post-colonial life. This paper, through pedagogical and bibliographical modes, situates the development and effect of this onerous popular fictional phenomenon as a relevant precursor to the origin and development of not only present day Nigerian Literature but also to a large extent, to the Anglophone West African Literature...|$|E

50|$|Hudson’s work is {{concerned}} with ideas of Britishness and contemporary culture. His most recent series, The Rise and Fall of Young Sen - The Contemporary Artist’s Progress, satirises social stereotypes and the vulgarity that can stem from wealth, frame and consumer culture. Dylan Jones wrote in GQ magazine: “the pictures are saturated with contemporary cultural references ‘satirising the absurdity of <b>modern</b> <b>life,</b> from political <b>issues</b> to social stereotypes and the contemporary art world’”. Hudson also often pays tribute other artists from history either through emulating their style or re-appropriating their compositions. Examples include Van Gogh, Hieronymus Bosch as well as William Hogarth.|$|R
2500|$|According to George Maestri, Rocko has {{no family}} name because the writers {{did not think}} of a family name that they desired. In a concept sketch Murray named the {{character}} [...] "Rocko Rama". The writers considered the family name [...] "Stretchbrain" [...] because the character's brain popped out of his head during [...] "odd moments." [...] The writers scrapped the idea, leaving the character with one given name. Some websites, including Hot Topic, give him the family name [...] "Wallabee" [...] and the middle name [...] "James". In [...] "Dental Hyjinks," [...] the first story of the Marvel Comics Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> series <b>Issue</b> #1 , the nurse addresses Rocko as [...] "Mr. Rocko."

5000|$|A {{whole life}} policy {{is said to}} [...] "mature" [...] at death or the {{maturity}} age of 100, whichever comes first. To be more exact the maturity date will be the [...] "policy anniversary nearest age 100". The policy becomes a [...] "matured endowment" [...] when the insured person lives past the stated maturity age. In that event the policy owner receives the face amount in cash. With many <b>modern</b> whole <b>life</b> policies, <b>issued</b> since approximately 2000, maturity ages have been increased to 120. Increased maturity ages {{have the advantage of}} preserving the tax-free nature of the death benefit. In contrast, a matured endowment may have substantial tax obligations.|$|R
40|$|A cursory {{glance at}} the daily sports news {{highlights}} perennial philosophical and ethical issues in sport: drug taking, cheating, corruption, discrimination and violence, amongst many others. Indeed, the hot topics {{on the day of}} writing include: a criminal investigation into corruption within a high profile sport Governing body, concern over the effects of concussion in contact sport, a judicial challenge on whether a card game should be classified as a sport, officials banned for match fixing, further discussion about the introduction of goal-line technology, and ongoing lamentation by politicians on the low profile of women’s sport. We are confronted with philosophical and ethical issues in sport on a daily basis and they regularly form heated arguments between aficionados everywhere. Sport is a large part of <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b> The <b>issues</b> that sport raises are even larger. And nearly everyone has an opinion. Many of those interested in these types of issues and discussions have not been explicitly introduced to philosophic methods or to the philosophy of sport as a distinct academic subject. Yet when these debates occur in the pub, on the terraces or in the media, those involved are engaging in a philosophical discussion about the meaning and value of sport and the concepts related to it. This chapter aims to provide an overview to the uninitiated as to the development and history of the philosophy of sport, the types of questions raised, and the methods used to answer them. It will demonstrate that what many people do naturally when they discuss sporting issues is essentially philosophy; but it will also highlight where and how philosophy is done badly and how philosophical arguments and skills can be improved...|$|R
