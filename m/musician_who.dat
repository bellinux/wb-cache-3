5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian <b>musician</b> <b>who</b> also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished <b>musician</b> <b>who</b> sells his {{saxophone}} {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely.

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted {{exclusively}} {{to the music of}} Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur <b>musician</b> <b>who</b> became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, one of which {{included}} the first complete performance of {{the final version of}} his First Symphony and another the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had spent much time keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur <b>musician</b> <b>who</b> became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E
