2500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the primary}} tools that chemists and {{chemical}} engineers use to separate mixtures into their constituents. Because distillation cannot separate the constituents of an azeotrope, the separation of azeotropic mixtures (also called azeotrope breaking) is a topic of considerable interest. Indeed, this difficulty led some early investigators to believe that azeotropes were actually compounds of their constituents. But there are two reasons for believing {{that this is not the}} case. One is that the <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of the constituents of an azeotrope is not generally the ratio of small integers. For example, the azeotrope formed by water and acetonitrile contains 2.253 moles ( [...] or 9/4 with a relative error of just 2% [...] ) of acetonitrile for each mole of water. A more compelling reason for believing that azeotropes are not compounds is, as discussed in the last section, that the composition of an azeotrope can be affected by pressure. Contrast that with a true compound, carbon dioxide for example, which is two moles of oxygen for each mole of carbon no matter what pressure the gas is observed at. That azeotropic composition can be affected by pressure suggests a means by which such a mixture can be separated.|$|E

40|$|Organic carbon (OC) {{stability}} in tropical soils is strongly interlinked with multivalent cation interaction and mineral association. Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) represent the readily biodegradable OC. Therefore, investigating retention mechanisms of LMWOAs in mineral-cation-LMWOAs systems {{is critical to}} understanding soil C cycling. Given the general acidic conditions and dominance of kaolinite in tropical soils, we investigated the retention mechanisms of citric acid (CA) in kaolinite-Fe(III) -CA systems with various Fe/CA <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> at pH ~ 3. 5 using Fe K-edge EXAFS and L₃,₂-edge XANES techniques. With Fe/CA <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> ≤ 2, the formed ferrihydrite mainly contributed to CA retention through adsorption and/or coprecipitation. With Fe/CA <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> from 2 to 0. 5, ternary complexation of CA to kaolinite via a five-coordinated Fe(III) bridge retained higher CA than ferrihydrite-induced adsorption and/or coprecipitation. With Fe/CA <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> = 0. 5, kaolinite-Fe(III) -citrate complexation preferentially occurred, but less CA was retained than via outer-sphere kaolinite-CA complexation. This study highlighted the significant impact of varied Fe/CA <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> on CA retention mechanisms in kaolinite-Fe(III) -CA systems under acidic conditions, and clearly showed the important contribution of Fe-bridged ternary complexation on CA retention.

[...] In general, in vitro assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity {{in the absence}} of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. [...] For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins. [...] Moreover, Paclitaxel has been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation; in a <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Iso-thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waal’s forces. Paclitaxel is sometimes used for in vivo studies as well; it can be fed to test organisms, such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. [...] Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo and inhibits hPAD2 in vitro though its methyl ester side chain.

40|$|AbstractSeven {{to eight}} species of viral subgenomic mRNAs are {{produced}} in coronavirus-infected cells. These mRNAs are produced in different quantities, and their <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> remain constant during viral replication. We studied RNA elements that affect coronavirus transcription efficiency by characterizing {{a series of}} cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing an inserted intergenic sequence, from which subgenomic DI RNA is transcribed in MHV-infected cells. Certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the intergenic sequence suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, yet changing one of the flanking sequences to a different sequence eliminated transcription suppression. The suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences, but not all combinations, could be counteracted by altering the intergenic sequence. Thus, the combination of intergenic sequence and flanking sequence affected transcription efficiency. We also characterized another set of DI RNAs designed to clarify which transcription step determines the relative <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of coronavirus mRNAs. Our study indicated that if subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively synthesized from negative-strand genomic RNA, then the relative <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of coronavirus mRNAs were most likely determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA. If negative-strand subgenomic RNAs were templates for subgenomic mRNAs, then the relative <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of coronavirus mRNAs probably were determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA used for subgenomic-sized RNA transcription but prior to {{the completion of the}} synthesis of subgenomic-sized RNAs containing the leader sequence.
