5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material.

5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the mirror would result in twice the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the aim point.
