40|$|This Article {{addresses}} insolvency law-related {{issues in}} connection with certain financial-markets contracts, such as securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements (repos), swaps and other derivatives, and <b>master</b> <b>netting</b> <b>agreements.</b> The Bankruptcy Code provides special treatment—safe harbors—for these contracts (collectively, qualified financial contracts or QFCs). This special treatment is considerably more favorable for nondebtor parties to QFCs than the rules applicable to nondebtor parties to other contracts with a debtor. Yet even some strong critics of the safe harbors concede that some special treatment may be warranted. This Article offers {{a critique of the}} safe harbor for settlement payments, as interpreted by the courts, and the safe harbor for transfers {{in connection with}} securities contracts that is clearly written into the Bankruptcy Code. It provides an overview of the legislative history, describes the scope and operation of the statutory components of the safe harbors, briefly describes the various academic critiques, and offers my general views on revisions that should be made to the safe harbor provisions. It questions the quite expansive interpretation given by some courts to the safe harbor for settlement payments. It then explains how the safe harbor for transfers made in connection with security contracts could be used to protect from the avoidance powers payments and collateralizations of ordinary debt, transactions {{that have nothing to do}} with the QFC markets...|$|R
40|$|According to the Romanian law {{the debtor}} that faces {{financial}} difficulties {{of a certain}} extent can be {{the object of the}} insolvency procedure, regulated by Law no. 85 / 2006 concerning the insolvency procedure. Because the insolvent debtor is no longer trustworthy to its contractual partners and cannot execute the assumed obligations, there is a risk that these contracts cease, or the services that are incumbent on contractual parties are not executed. This is why, {{it is very important to}} know within the insolvency procedure and, especially during the judicial reorganization period, what will be the treatment of contracts concluded prior to the opening of this procedure and still not executed, the so-called “contracts under execution”. Also, after clarifying the concept of contract under execution, it is important to establish who has the right to opt between their continuation, or their cancellation. On the other hand, there are presented the special rules provided by Law no. 85 / 2006 for some categories of contracts concluded prior to the opening of the insolvency procedure, such as: labor, lease, commission contracts, <b>master</b> of <b>netting</b> <b>agreement</b> or contracts concluded intuitu personae or by a debtor that is the owner of a leased building, etc...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to {{the recent}} {{development}} of analytical pricing models for swaps with bilateral credit risk, a comprehensive analysis of the dimensions of default risk has become possible. Using the model developed by Hubner (2001) for IRS and CS, this article investigates the impact of structural and temporary credit risk changes on swap prices. It emphasizes that large variations in swap values and sensitivities may exist depending on the sources of credit risk differences between the counterparties. This phenomenon is stronger for CS because of the exchange of principal and an additional correlation risk that exhibits a nonnegligible impact on the contract value. The influence of a <b>netting</b> <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> also can be analyzed {{for a wide range}} of initial contract values and netted notionals. The results confirm the hedging properties put forward by Duffie and Huang (1996) as a special case, but clearly show that they cannot be generalized to any netting pattern. Prevailing market conditions are shown to play a central role in the effectiveness of netting as a hedging device. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the legal environment of <b>netting</b> <b>agreements</b> covering financial contracts. It concludes that an international instrument {{should be developed}} capable of improving the effectiveness of <b>netting</b> <b>agreements</b> in mitigating systemic risk. To this end, two {{different aspects of the}} enforceability of <b>netting</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered: (i) the general enforceability of netting, and (ii) the possibility of precluding the operation of netting a mechanism by way of a regulatory moratorium for considerations of systemic stability. The first part of the study presents the use of netting and the various forms it may take before going on to explain the benefits and drawbacks of enforceable <b>netting</b> <b>agreements.</b> Benefits for individual firms consist in lower counterparty risk and more favourable capital requirements. Benefits for the financial market as a whole flow from greater financial market stability since the contagion of systemically relevant institutions by the default or insolvency of another institution is limited, thus helping to avoid systemic effects. Additionally, the use of netting arrangements can improve overall market liquidity. A potential drawback of enforceability of netting, in certain situations, is that the operation of a netting mechanism could actually work against the purpose of systemic stability where the transfer of parts of the business of an insolvent financial institution to a solvent bridge entity would enhance or maintain value {{to a greater extent than}} the operation of a <b>netting</b> <b>agreement</b> would. Regulatory authorities are considering under which conditions a moratorium to halt the netting mechanism until the situation is solved could avoid this threat to systemic stability. The second part of the {{study examines}} whether there is the potential to support the purpose of enhanced systemic stability by way of international harmonisation of private and insolvency law. As regards the issue of general enforceability, the global picture of netting legislation is heterogeneous. Given the great practical relevance of the matter, an international instrument could be very useful. As to the issue of private law consequences of regulatory moratoria, the absence of a harmonised framework appears to lead to actual cross-border inconsistency and legal uncertainty as regards financial contracts that are governed by a foreign law. Taking these to aspects into account, this paper recommends that work on developing an international instrument be undertaken. The final part of the study suggests a set of preliminary guidelines for the development of suchan instrument. In the light of the findings of the previous sections, a mixed, two-step approach is recommended. First, a non-binding instrument could be developed, serving as a benchmark and reservoir of legal solutions in respect of the relevant issues. Secondly, isolated aspects relating to both the general enforceability of netting and the accommodation of a regulatory moratorium in foreign private and insolvency law could be dealt with in an international Convention, in particular where cross-border situations involving netting require uniformity of applicable legal rules...|$|R

The model considers options traded mutually between two option writers one of which may default.

Using a numerical approximation (Monte-Carlo simulation), netting and portfolio effects are shown to increase the credit-risk adjusted value of a trading position. The paper shows that the price which a counterparty is willing to receive (pay) for selling (buying) an option, is less (more) than the usual price if the option has a credit risk mitigation effect on the existent portfolio...|$|R
