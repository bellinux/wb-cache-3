He {{distinguished}} {{himself as an}} instructor at the Imperial and Royal Naval Academy in Fiume (now Rijeka); a product of his academic study was Oceanography and <b>Maritime</b> <b>Meteorology</b> (1891). Returning to a seagoing command, Haus was commander of a corvette during the multinational intervention in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900/01. After {{the suppression of the}} insurrection Haus remained in Peking (now Beijing) until 1902.|$|E

He was appointed Professor of Oceanography and <b>Maritime</b> <b>Meteorology</b> at the Christian Albrecht University in Kiel (see University of Kiel) and Director of the Institut für Meereskunde (see http://www.geomar.de/en) of Kiel University. Under his direction the institute increased considerably, international relationships were renewed [...] and Kiel University became the prime institution for marine sciences education in Germany. His textbook [...] was the standard reading for students. Dietrich also carried outstanding responsibility in planning the new research vessel [...] "Meteor" [...] https://epic.awi.de/28599/1/DHI1978a.pdf. The ship was put into service in 1964 and had its first major cruise in the International Indian Ocean Expedition in 1964/1965. Dietrich later had major responsibilities in planning and preparing the multi-national ICES expedition OVERFLOW 1973. Unfortunately he died {{a few months before}} the start of the program.|$|E

50|$|The Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences in Berlin was {{destroyed}} by bombing in 1944 and was never rebuilt {{after the end of}} World War II.In early 1946 Wüst was offered the job of rebuilding marine research in Kiel, Germany. The Institute of Marine Science (German: Institut für Meereskunde) of the University of Kiel (German: Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, CAU) had also lost many members of its staff and its building by a bombing raid. Wüst became Professor of Oceanography and <b>Maritime</b> <b>Meteorology</b> at Kiel University and Director of the Institute of Marine Science. He succeeded in bringing back some of the earlier staff, was provided with an old villa as an institute building, obtained the research cutter Südfall and restarted marine science teaching. The main focus of the institute in Kiel had been marine biology in the shallow seas of the Baltic and the North Sea before, with some history of hydrography, marine chemistry and marine geology. Wüst brought his experience in deep-sea research to bear in the scientific orientation of the Kiel institute. He and ultimately his successor from 1959, Günter Dietrich, an earlier collaborator in the Berlin institute, changed the earlier focus towards deep ocean work, in particular in physical oceanography and marine chemistry. With this scientific orientation and the related teaching the Kiel institute took over the legacy of the Berlin institute. In particular the teaching required a close association with Kiel University. From 1950 to 1952 Wüst served as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy which also enclosed Mathematics and Science at that time.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to {{debates about the}} relationship between science and the military by examining the British Admiralty’s participation in meteorological projects {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century. It focuses on attempts to transform Royal Naval log books into standardized meteorological registers that would be of use to both science and the state. The paper begins with a discussion of Admiralty Hydrographer, Francis Beaufort, who promoted the use of standardized systems for the observation of the weather at sea. It then examines the application of ships’ logs to the science of storms. The paper focuses on the Army Engineer, William Reid, who studied hurricanes while stationed in Barbados and Bermuda. Reid was instrumental in persuading the Admiralty to implement a naval meteorological policy, something the Admiralty Hydrographer had struggled to achieve. The paper uses the reception and adoption of work on storms at sea to reflect on the means and ends of <b>maritime</b> <b>meteorology</b> in the mid-nineteenth century...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{measuring system}} for the partial pressure, pCO 2, of atmospheric and oceanic carbon dioxide was developed. The system was mounted on a moored buoy for routine observation of <b>maritime</b> <b>meteorology</b> in the East China Sea. CO 2 observations were conducted from 29 June 1997 to 6 January 1998. During the observation period, the atmospheric pCO 2 showed little variation (341 to 365 μatm), whereas pCO 2 in the surface water varied significantly (308 to 408 μatm). In the summer, pCO 2 was higher in the surface water than in the overlying atmosphere, implying that this area was a source for atmospheric CO 2, though it became a sink after late September. Time-series data clearly exhibited significant short-term variations in the oceanic pCO 2, i. e., sudden variations during the passage of typhoons, and diurnal variations driven by the diurnal variations in the sea-surface temperature under calm conditions. The effects of typhoons on ocean-atmosphere CO 2 exchange at the surface could differ, depending on the relative position of the mooring site {{with respect to the}} center of the moving typhoons. These differences result from the different contributions of sea-surface cooling, entrainment, and upwelling. The efflux enhanced by three typhoons accounted for 60 % of the efflux of CO 2 in the warm season. It is suggested that typhoons have a significant impact on the carbon cycle in the western subtropical North Pacific...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to put the {{foundation}} of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute in 1854 in a broader context. It focusses on large foreign projects of a Humboldtean nature, such as the the rising magnetic and meteorological networks of the thirties and fourties, the role of universities, local societies and the government, and the practical dimensions of meteorology. It deals with the pioneering work on meteorology of Willem Wenckebach an his ally Richard van Rees, both of whom had participated in international networks. When Buys Ballot succeeded Wenckebach as the Utrecht professor of mathematics, he also adopted the latter's role as the main representant of Dutch meteorology. His primary aim was to raise meteorology to the level of an exact science. In 1848 he founded a meteorological observatory with the help of his friend Krecke. It was in every respect a private enterprise. Its primary aim was to become the centre of a national, and eventually an international, network. Financial support came from local societies. In his attempts to gain government recognition and support, Buys Ballot joined forces with the Dutch naval officer Jansen. The latter's contacts with Maury in Washington enabled Buys Ballot to convince the government of the practical meaning of meteorology. Charts of winds and seacurrents promised a considerable shortening of sailing passages. Hesitations of the Duch government to create a state institution were eventually overcome after the Brussels international conference on <b>maritime</b> <b>meteorology.</b> Comparison with a contemporaneous Humboldtean project, the geological charting of the Netherlands, allows for some generalisations with regard to the role of professors, experts, societies and the government in midcentury scientific projects of a national character...|$|E
