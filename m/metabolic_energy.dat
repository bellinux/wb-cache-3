25|$|Research {{suggests}} that lobsters may not slow down, weaken or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters {{may be more}} fertile than younger lobsters. This longevity {{may be due to}} telomerase, an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages, but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike most vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Lobster longevity is limited by their size. Moulting requires <b>metabolic</b> <b>energy</b> and the larger the lobster, the more energy is needed; 10 to 15% of lobsters die of exhaustion during moulting, while in older lobsters, moulting ceases and the exoskeleton degrades or collapses entirely leading to death.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{are exposed}} to large oxygen {{fluctuations}} in their aquatic environment since the inherent properties of water can result in marked spatial and temporal differences in the concentration of oxygen (see oxygenation and underwater). Fish respond to hypoxia with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses {{in order to maintain}} homeostasis and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining <b>metabolic</b> <b>energy</b> balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for ATP production through the electron transport chain.

500|$|The use {{of oxygen}} {{as part of}} the process for {{generating}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>energy</b> produces reactive oxygen species. In this process, the superoxide anion is produced as a by-product of several steps in the electron transport chain. Particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme Q in complex III, since a highly reactive free radical is formed as an intermediate (Q·−). This unstable intermediate can lead to electron [...] "leakage", when electrons jump directly to oxygen and form the superoxide anion, instead of moving through the normal series of well-controlled reactions of the electron transport chain. Peroxide is also produced from the oxidation of reduced flavoproteins, such as complex I. However, although these enzymes can produce oxidants, the relative importance of the electron transfer chain to other processes that generate peroxide is unclear. In plants, algae, [...] and cyanobacteria, reactive oxygen species are also produced during photosynthesis, particularly under conditions of high light intensity. This effect is partly offset by the involvement of carotenoids in photoinhibition, and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of iodide and selenium, which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the photosynthetic reaction centres to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species.|$|E

30|$|Numerous {{researchers}} {{have concluded that}} tissue microenvironment is an important determinant of carcinogenesis. One of the contributing factors to cancer cell adaptation is a hypoxic environment [54]. Hypoxia is associated with increased metastatic potential, development of resistance to therapies, and poor prognosis [8]. Hypoxic stress can activate the HIF-signal pathway, which presents a strong relationship with the <b>energy</b> <b>metabolic</b> process, especially in regulating the triosephosphate isomerase expression [55]. <b>Energy</b> <b>metabolic</b> dysfunction can promote {{the establishment of a}} hypoxic microenvironment, particularly through abnormal mitochondrial aerobic respiration and increased rate of glycolysis. An acidic tissue microenvironment is also correlated with <b>energy</b> <b>metabolic</b> dysfunction, mainly because a high rate of glycolysis generates a large amount of lactic acid, which promotes the generation of acidic tissue microenvironment [56]. Another contributing factor is elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). The mechanism for elevated IFP was reported to be the dysfunction of the lymphatic system [57]; such dysfunction can help cancer cells escape from the attack of functional lymphatics and create conducive conditions for various metabolites and cell growth factors and cytokines [58].|$|R

[...] In double support, the trailing leg works in conjunction with the leading leg to redirect the COM motion upward. [...] During this step-to-step transition period, the trailing leg exerts positive mechanical work on the COM while the leading leg exerts negative mechanical work on the COM. [...] To maintain steady walking gait requires the sum of these work terms, or the net work, to be equal to zero since any changes in system energy would impart different COM velocities between the start and end of transition.
