The remaining viruses all share some antigenic components which react with hyperimmune rabbit sera prepared against Semliki Forest virus. However, using single-dose rabbit sera, or more specific mouse-immune sera, four distinct subgroups can be defined. One includes Semliki Forest virus strains; another Chikungunya virus and its substrains, Vereeniging and TH 35 viruses; the third contains O'nyong-nyong virus; and the fourth <b>Mayaro</b> and Uruma <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The virus’s {{transmission}} cycle {{in the wild}} {{is similar to the}} continuous sylvatic cycle of yellow fever and is believed to involve wild primates (monkeys) as the reservoir and the tree-canopy-dwelling Haemagogus species mosquito as the vector. [...] Human infections are strongly associated with exposure to humid tropical forest environments. Chikungunya virus is closely related, producing a nearly indistinguishable, highly debilitating arthralgic disease. On February 19, 2011, a Portuguese-language news source reported on a recent survey which revealed <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> activity in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. [...] The survey studied blood samples from 600 residents of Manaus who had experienced a high fever; <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> was identified in 33 cases. Four of the cases experienced mild hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms, which had not previously been described in <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> disease. The report stated that this outbreak is the first detected in a metropolitan setting, and expressed concern that the disease might be adapting to urban species of mosquito vectors, which would make it a risk for spreading within the country. A study published in 1991 demonstrated that a colonized strain of Brazilian Aedes albopictus was capable of acquiring MAYV from infected hamsters and subsequently transmitting it and a study published in October 2011 demonstrated that Aedes aegypti can transmit MAYV, supporting the possibility of wider transmission of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> disease in urban settings.|$|E

40|$|Arthrogenic alphaviruses, such as Ross River virus (RRV), chikungunya, Sindbis, <b>mayaro</b> and o'nyong-nyong <b>viruses</b> {{circulate}} endemically worldwide, frequently causing {{outbreaks of}} polyarthritis. The exact mechanisms of how alphaviruses induce polyarthritis remain ill defined, although macrophages {{are known to}} play a key role. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important cytokine involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. Here, we characterize the role of MIF in alphavirus-induced arthritides using a mouse model of RRV-induced arthritis, which has many characteristics of RRV disease in humans. RRV-infected WT mice developed severe disease associated with up-regulated MIF expression in serum and tissues, which corresponded to severe inflammation and tissue damage. MIF-deficient (MIF-/-) mice developed mild disease accompanied by a reduction in inflammatory infiltrates and muscle destruction in the tissues, despite having viral titers similar to WT mice. In addition, reconstitution of MIF into MIF-/- mice exacerbated RRV disease and treatment of mice with MIF antagonist ameliorated disease in WT mice. Collectively, {{these findings suggest that}} MIF plays a critical role in determining the clinical severity of alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease and may provide a target for the development of antiviral pharmaceuticals. The prospect being that early treatment with MIF-blocking pharmaceuticals may curtail the debilitating arthritis associated with alphaviral infections.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} were to document the potential presence of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection in Ecuador and to examine potential risk factors for <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection among the personnel of a military garrison in the Amazonian rainforest. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of the personnel of a garrison located in the Ecuadorian Amazonian rainforest. The cross-sectional study employed interviews and seroepidemiological methods. Humoral immune response to <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection was assessed by evaluating IgM- and IgG-specific antibodies using ELISA. Results: Of 338 subjects studied, 174 were from the Coastal zone of Ecuador, 73 from Andean zone, and 91 were native to the Amazonian rainforest. Seroprevalence of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection was more than 20 times higher among Amazonian natives (46 %) than among subjects born in other areas (2 %). Conclusions: Age and hunting in the rainforest were significant predictors of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection overall and among Amazonian natives. The results provide the first demonstration of the potential presence of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> infection in Ecuador and a systematic evaluation of risk factors for the transmission of this alphavirus. The large difference in prevalence rates between Amazonian natives and other groups and between older and younger natives suggest that <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> is endemic and enzootic in the rainforest, with sporadic outbreaks that determine differences in risk between birth cohorts of natives. Deep forest hunting may selectively expose native men, descendants of the Shuar and Huaronai ethnic groups, to the arthropod vectors of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> in areas close to primate reservoirs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> {{produces}} a nonspecific, sublethal disease in man with symptoms {{that are often}} confused with dengue. The symptoms of arthralgia, often associated with these viral infections, can cause an incapacitating disability. To date, outbreaks have been localized and sporadic within the Pan-Amazonia forest since its first isolation in 1954 (Trinidad and Tobago). The available literature is diverse, scarce and dispersed. <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> is an alphavirus, which is phylogenetically related to the Semliki forest antigenic complex. In the New World, Mayaro and the related UNA viruses are the only members of this complex that have been isolated. The genome of Mayaro consists of single-stranded RNA with a positive charge and a length of 12 kb that can be subdivided into genomic and subgenomic regions that encode nonstructural and structural proteins, respectively. Mayaro has shown great plasticity in hosts for vertebrate infections, but high specificity in invertebrates towards the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Risk factors for infection are forested areas in northern South America and the rainy season. Two genotypes of MAYV have been identified, L (restricted to Belterra, Brazil) and D (widely distributed in the Pan-Amazonia). The enzootic cycle {{is similar to the}} jungle cycle of yellow fever, which involves Haemagogus mosquitoes and monkeys as reservoirs. Of concern is the potential spread of the virus by the involvement of other secondary vectors and hosts such as Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Aedes scapularis that have been shown experimentally to efficiently transmit the virus. Together with the observed high viremia levels of infected individuals, a significant risk exists for an emerging disease in urban, rural and peridomestic locations close to enzootic foci of <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus...</b>|$|E
40|$|Alphaviruses are {{envelope}}d arboviruses. The {{viral envelope}} {{is derived from}} the host cell and is positioned between two icosahedral protein shells (T = 4). Because the viral envelope contains glycoproteins involved in cell recognition and entry, the integrity of the envelope is critical for the success of the early events of infection. Differing levels of cholesterol in different hosts leads to the production of alphaviruses with distinct levels of this sterol loaded in the envelope. Using <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus,</b> a New World alphavirus, we investigated the role of cholesterol on the envelope of alphavirus particles assembled in either mammalian or mosquito cells. Our results show that although quite different in their cholesterol content, <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> particles obtained from both cells share a similar high level of lateral organization in their envelopes. This organization, as well as viral stability and infectivity, is severely compromised when cholesterol is depleted from the envelope of virus particles isolated from mammalian cells, but virus particles isolated from mosquito cells are relatively unaffected by cholesterol depletion. We suggest that it is not cholesterol itself, but rather the organization of the viral envelope, that is critical for the biological activity of alphaviruses...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> (MAYV) is an {{emerging}} arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus). Infection by MAYV can produce <b>Mayaro</b> <b>virus</b> disease (MAYVD) {{which is usually}} a clinically diagnosed, acute, febrile illness associated with prolonged and painful joint inflammation and swelling. MAYVD may be clinically indistinguishable from dengue, chikungunya fever, malaria, rabies, measles or other arboviral diseases. The full spectrum of disease, sequelae, routes of infection, virus shedding and any rarer means of transmission remain undefined. MAYVD cases in humans have so far been localised to Central and South America, particularly regions {{in and around the}} Amazon basin. MAYV usually circulates in a sylvan cycle of forest mosquitoes and vertebrates, however it has also been found in more urban locations alongside anthropophilic (preferring humans) insect vectors. If transmission via anthropophilic mosquitoes becomes more efficient following viral change, or existing vectors change their habitat and biting habits, the risk of urban establishment and further spread into non-forested areas will grow.
