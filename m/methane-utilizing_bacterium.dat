40|$|The {{interactions}} between the component species of a mixed bacterial culture grown on methane were investigated. The culture contained the <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacterium</b> Methylo-coccus sp. and four heterotrophic bacteria which were unable to grow on methane but utilized products released by lysis of the Methylococcus sp. Products of methane oxidation such as methanol, formaldehyde and formate did not constitute {{a significant amount of}} the organic carbon found in the culture supernatant of the pure <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacterium</b> grown in chemostat culture. The organic carbon was accounted for mainly as protein and nucleic acid and originated from a growth-dependent lysis of the methane-utilizing bact-erium. In the mixed culture the level of the organic carbon was reduced and it is sug-gested that extracellular enzymes produced by the heterotrophic bacteria {{play a role in the}} degradation and utilization of these compounds. The major heterotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas sp.

A one-step marker exchange procedure was used to construct nitrogen fixation (nif) mutants of the obligate <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacterium</b> Methylosinus sp. strain 6, using transposon 5 (Tn 5) -containing nif genes cloned into pBR 325. The resultant mutants appeared to contain defects in nif structural genes, and DNA hybridization analysis showed that although {{one out of five}} had apparently been produced as a result of double-crossover homologous recombination, a variety of molecular events had led to the production of the other four mutants...|$|E

40|$|Over 20 new {{strains of}} <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> were {{isolated}} from lake water and soil samples. Cell suspensions {{of these and}} of other known strains of <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> oxidized n-alkanes (propane, butane, pentane, hexane) to their corresponding secondary alcohols (2 -propanol, 2 -butanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -hexanol). The product secondary alcohols accumulated extracellularly. The rate of production of secondary alcohols varied with the organism used for oxidation. The average rate of 2 -propanol, 2 -butanol, 2 -pentanol, and 2 -hexanol production was 1. 5, 1. 0, 0. 15, and 0. 08 μmol/h per 5. 0 mg of protein in cell suspensions, respectively. Secondary alcohols were slowly oxidized further to the corresponding methylketones. Primary alcohols and aldehydes were also detected in low amounts (rate of production were 0. 05 to 0. 08 μmol/h per 5. 0 mg of protein in cell suspensions) as products of n-alkane (propane and butane) oxidation. However, primary alcohols and aldehydes were rapidly metabolized further by cell suspensions. Methanol-grown cells of <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> did not oxidize n-alkanes to their corresponding secondary alcohols, indicating that the enzymatic system required for oxidation of n-alkanes was induced only during growth on methane. The optimal conditions for in vivo secondary alcohol formation from n-alkanes were investigated in Methylosinus sp. (CRL- 15). The rate of 2 -propanol and 2 -butanol production was linear for the 40 -min incubation period and increased directly with cell protein concentration up to 12 mg/ml. The optimal temperature and pH {{for the production of}} 2 -propanol and 2 -butanol were 40 °C and pH 7. 0. Metalchelating agents inhibited the production of secondary alcohols. The activities for the hydroxylation of n-alkanes in various methylotrophic bacteria were localized in the cell-free particulate fractions precipitated by centrifugation between 10, 000 and 40, 000 × g. Both oxygen and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide were required for hydroxylation activity. The metal-chelating agents inhibited hydroxylation of n-alkanes by the particulate fraction, indicating the involvement of a metal-containing enzyme system in the oxidation of n-alkanes. The production of 2 -propanol from the corresponding n-alkane by the particulate fraction was inhibited in the presence of methane, suggesting that the subterminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes may be catalyzed by methane monooxygenase...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{suspensions}} of <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{grown on}} methane oxidized n-alkanes (propane, butane, pentane, hexane) to their corresponding methylketones (acetone, 2 -butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone). The product methylketones accumulated extracellularly. The {{rate of production}} of methylketones varied with the organism used for oxidation; however, the average rate of acetone, 2 -butanone, 2 -pentanone, and 2 -hexanone production was 1. 2, 1. 0, 0. 15, and 0. 025 μmol/h per 5. 0 mg of protein in cell suspensions. Primary alcohols and aldehydes were also detected in low amounts as products of n-alkane (propane and butane) oxidation, but were rapidly metabolized further by cell suspensions. The optimal conditions for in vivo methylketone formation from n-alkanes were compared in Methylococcus capsulatus (Texas strain), Methylosinus sp. (CRL- 15), and Methylobacterium sp. (CRL- 26). The rate of acetone and 2 -butanone production was linear for the first 60 min of incubation and directly increased with cell concentration up to 10 mg of protein per ml for all three cultures tested. The optimal temperatures {{for the production of}} acetone and 2 -butanone were 35 °C for Methylosinus trichosporium sp. (CRL- 15) and Methylobacterium sp. (CRL- 26) and 40 °C for Methylcoccus capsulatus (Texas). Metal-chelating agents inhibited the production of methylketones, suggesting the involvement of a metal-containing enzymatic system in the oxidation of n-alkanes to the corresponding methylketones.

40|$|Biodegradation {{experiments}} with radioactively labeled trichloroethylene showed that 32 % of the radioactive carbon was converted to glyoxylic acid, dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid {{and that the}} same percentage was converted to CO 2 and CO after 140 h of incubation by a pure culture of a type II <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Methylocystis sp. strain M, isolated from a mixed culture, MU- 81, in our laboratory. In contrast, these water-soluble (14 C) trichloroethylene degradation products were completely or partially degraded further and converted to CO 2 by the MU- 81 mixed culture. This phenomenon was attributed {{to the presence of}} a heterotrophic bacterium (strain DA 4), which was identified as Xanthobacter autotrophicus, in the MU- 81 culture. The results indicate that the heterotrophic bacteria {{play an important role in}} complete trichloroethylene degradation by methanotrophs...|$|E

The pH optimum for growth was between 7 and 9, and the temperature optimum was between 30 and 37 °C. Methanol concentrations higher than 5 % (by weight) were toxic. Formaldehyde, at a concentration greater than 1 mM, inhibited growth. Formate was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor. An extracellular viscous heteropolysaccharide was produced during growth. The maximum production of the total biomass was 14. 5 g (dry weight) per liter of broth. The dried biomass contained 22 % (wt/wt) crude protein and 62 % (wt/wt) polysaccharide.

A methane-dependent coccus, {{with notes}} on {{classification}} and nomenclature of obligate, <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1924 – 1931. 1966. —A new coccus-shaped bacterium capable of aerobic growth {{at the expense}} of methane or methanol in a mineral salts medium is described. The organism did not grow {{at the expense of}} any of the conventional substrates or homologous hydrocarbons tested. It is gram-negative, nonmotile, and thermotolerant. It grows well at 50 C, optimally at 37 C, but does not grow at 55 C. The cells are encapsulated and have a characteristic diplococcoid arrangement. Washed, “resting-cell” suspensions oxidized certain primary alcohols and short-chain alkanes, an example of “nongrowth oxidation. ” Of the methane-C utilized, 86 % was “fixed” in organic form; the remainder was oxidized to CO 2. The guanine-cytosine content of the extracted deoxyribonucleic acid was 62. 5 %. Obligate <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> are considered as “one-carbon” organisms rather than hydrocarbon utilizers. The assimilation pathway in the obligate methane-methanol bacteria is different from that in the facultative methanol utilizers. Nomenclatural problems arising from the use of the prefix “Methano-” to denote both bacteria that oxidize methane and bacteria that produce methane are discussed. The obligate, one-carbon, methane-methanol bacteria are considered as “methyl” utilizers, and the prefix “Methylo-” is suggested as {{a solution to the problem}} of generic cognomens. “Methylococcus capsulatus” gen. n., sp. n. is the name proposed for the new methane coccus...|$|R
40|$|The {{cause of}} the failure of the C 2 H 2 -C 2 H 4 assay for nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} growing on lower alkanes was studied. Acetylene was a strong competitive inhibitor of methane oxidation for <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> {{as well as for the}} oxidation of lower alkanes by other bacteria, so that energy and reducing power were no longer available for the reduction of acetylene by nitrogenase. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria grown on alkanes may reduce acetylene when intermediates of alkane-breakdown or other substrates oxidizable in the presence of acetylene are supplied. Ethylene co-oxidation is not responsible for the failure of the test, because acetylene also inhibits this co-oxidation along with methane oxidation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> were {{examined}} by electron microscopy {{and found to}} possess complex membranous structures within the cytoplasm. Two types of membrane organization were recognized. One type consisted of pairs of membranes which either extended throughout the organism or were arranged at the periphery where they ran parallel to the cytoplasmic mem-brane. The other type consisted of vesicular discs of membrane organized into bundles which were distributed throughout the organism. Bacteria utilizing C, to C 4 gaseous n-alkanes and C,, to C,, liquid n-alkane mixture did not possess such extensive membranous structures. The former contained mem-branous bodies of the mesosome type, whilst the latter possessed only a cytoplasmic membrane. These structural differences add to the growing list of properties separating CH,-utilizing bacteria from those utilizing C, and higher n-alkanes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (methanotrophs) are {{important}} in both environmental and biotechnological applications, due {{to their ability to}} convert methane to multicarbon compounds. However, systems-level studies of methane metabolism have not been carried out in methanotrophs. In this work we have integrated genomic and transcriptomic information to provide an overview of central metabolic pathways for methane utilization in Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b, a model alphaproteobacterial methanotroph. Particulate methane monooxygenase, PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, the H 4 MPT-pathway and NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase are involved in methane oxidation to CO 2. All genes essential for operation of the serine cycle, the ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle were expressed. PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate interconversions may have a function in regulation and balancing carbon between the serine cycle and the EMC pathway. A set of transaminases may contribute to carbon partitioning between the pathways. Metabolic pathways for acquisition and/or assimilation of nitrogen and iron are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> methanotrophs, have {{application}} as biocatalysts in {{the commodity}} chemical production, waste treatment and environmental remediation industries. Methanotrophs {{have the ability}} to oxidize many chemical compounds into more desired products, such as the production of propylene oxide. Methanotrophs can also degrade toxic compounds such as trichloroethylene. However, there are many physical, chemical and biological problems associated with the continuous oxidation of chemicals. These include, low mass transfer of methane, oxygen and propylene; toxicity of substrates and degradation products, and competition between the growth substrate, i. e., methane and chemical feed stock, e. g., propylene for the biocatalyst. To supervise methanotrophic bioprocesses, an intelligent control system must accommodate any biological limitations, e. g., toxicity, and mitigate the impact of the physical and chemical limitations, e. g., mass transfer of methane and the solubility of propylene. The intelligent control system must have the capability to assess the current conditions and metabolic state of the bacteria; recognize and diagnose instrument faults; and select and maintain sets of parameters that will result in high production and growth...|$|R
40|$|Symbioses between chemolithoautotrophic {{bacteria}} {{and the major}} macrofaunal species found at hydrothermal vents have been reported for numerous sites in the Pacific Ocean. We present microscopical and enzymatic evidence that methylotrophic bacteria occur as intracellular symbionts in a new species of mytilid mussel discovered at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vents. Two distinct ultrastructural types of gram-negative procaryotic symbionts were observed within gill epithelial cells by transmission electron microscopy: small coccoid or rod-shaped cells and larger coccoid cells with stacked intracytoplasmic membranes typical of <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Methanol dehydrogenase, an enzyme diagnostic of methylotrophs, was detected in the mytilid gills, while tests for ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase, the enzyme diagnostic of autotrophy via the Calvin cycle, were negative. Stable carbon isotope values (δ 13 C) of mytilid tissue (− 32. 7 and − 32. 5 % for gill and foot tissues, respectively) fall {{within the range of}} values reported for Pacific vent symbioses but do not preclude the use of vent-derived methane reported to be isotopically heavy relative to biogenically produced methane...|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated ethenes are toxic {{substances}} which are widely distributed groundwater contaminants and are persistent in the subsurface environment. Reports on the biodegradation of these compounds under anaerobic conditions which might occur naturally in groundwater show that these substances degrade very slowly, if at all. Previous attempts to degrade chlorinated ethenes aerobically have produced conflicting results. A mixed culture containing <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{was obtained by}} methane enrichment of a sediment sample. Biodegradation experiments carried out in sealed culture bottles with radioactively labeled trichloroethylene (TCE) showed that {{approximately half of the}} radioactive carbon had been converted to 14 CO 2 and bacterial biomass. In addition to TCE, vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride could be degraded to products which are not volatile chlorinated substances and are therefore likely to be further degraded to CO 2. Two other chlorinated ethenes, cis and trans- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, were shown to degrade to chlorinated products, which appeared to degrade further. A sixth chlorinated ethene, tetrachloroethylene, was not degraded by the methane-utilizing culture under these conditions. The biodegradation of TCE was inhibited by acetylene, a specific inhibitor of methane oxidation by methanotrophs. This observation supported the hypothesis that a methanotroph is responsible for the observed biodegradations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> are of {{potential}} value for production of single-cell protein and the efficiency {{with which they}} convert methane to biomass is therefore of practical as well as theoretical interest. Several reports of cell-yield determinations have recently been collated (Barnes et al., 1977), {{but there is some}} variation in the values obtained. Recent studies with several methylGtrophs (Davey & Mitton, 1973; Tonge et al., 1974; Anthony, 1 9 7 5 ~ ~; Widdowson & Anthony, 1975) have led to schemes being proposed for their electron trans-port and energy transducing systems (Tonge et al., 1975; Higgins, Knowles & Tonge, 1977). Theoretical analyses of the relationships between cell-yield data, sites of ATP synthesis and P/O ratios have also been published (Van Dijken & Harder, 1975; Barnes et al., 1977). How-ever, there are no direct experimental data concerning either the sites of ATP synthesis or the P/O ratios associated with substrate oxidation in these bacteria. The chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation (Mitchell, I 966 a, 6) postulates that a transmembrane proton gradient is generated as a result of electron flow down the respiratory chain and that this gradient can drive ATP synthesis such that I mol ATP is synthesized per 2 g-equiv.

40|$|Soluble c-type cytochromes {{are central}} to {{metabolism}} of C 1 compounds in methylotrophic bacteria. In order to characterize the role of c-type cytochromes in <b>methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (methanotrophs), we have purified four different cytochromes, cytochromes c- 554, c- 553, c- 552, and c- 551, from the marine methanotroph Methylomonas sp. strain A 4. The two major species, cytochromes c- 554 and c- 552, were monoheme cytochromes and accounted for 57 and 26 %, respectively, of the soluble c-heme. The approximate molecular masses were 8, 500 daltons (Da) (cytochrome c- 554) and 14, 000 Da (cytochrome c- 552), and the isoelectric points were pH 6. 4 and 4. 7, respectively. Two possible diheme c-type cytochromes were also isolated in lesser amounts from Methylomonas sp. strain A 4, cytochromes c- 551 and c- 553. These were 16, 500 and 34, 000 Da, respectively, and had isoelectric points at pH 4. 75 and 4. 8, respectively. Cytochrome c- 551 accounted for 9 % of the soluble c-heme, and cytochrome c- 553 accounted for 8 %. All four cytochromes differed in their oxidized versus reduced absorption maxima and their extinction coefficients. In addition, cytochromes c- 554, c- 552, and c- 551 were shown to have different electron paramagnetic spectra and N-terminal amino acid sequences. None of the cytochromes showed significant activity with purified methanol dehydrogenase in vitro, but our data suggested that cytochrome c- 552 is probably the in vivo electron acceptor for the methanol dehydrogenase...|$|R
40|$|<b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>{{bacteria}}</b> (methanotrophs) are {{a diverse}} group of gram-negative bacteria that are related to other members of the Proteobacteria. These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X methanotrophs are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs, which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I methanotrophs appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured methanotrophs represent new genera. Methanotrophs that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of methanotrophs available in pure cultures. A limited number of methanotrophs have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene...|$|R
40|$|The facultative {{methanol}} utilizer Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 contains {{at least}} three genes (mxaA, K and L) that encode functions involved in providing calcium to the holoenzyme of methanol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde in this strain. <b>Methane-utilizing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (methanotrophs) also contain methanol dehydrogenase, and evidence suggests that similar methanol oxidation (Mox) functions may be present {{in some of these}} strains. DNA fragments from Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 specific to mxaA, mxaK and mxaL were isolated for use as hybridization probes against genomic digests of a variety of methanotrophic bacteria. Only the mxaL probe showed substantial hybridization, and it was used to identify and isolate an 8 · 5 kb HindIII fragment from Methylobacter albus BG 8 (a Type I methanotroph). Hybridization of restriction digests of this fragment to individual probes for Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 mxaA, K and L indicated that the relative mxa gene order in Methylobacter albus BG 8 is A-K-L. A T 7 dual promoter/polymerase protein expression system indicated that five polypeptides are expressed from a 4 · 5 kb region of Methylobacter albus BG 8 DNA in Escherichia coli, all transcribed in the same direction, and they apparently correspond to mxaACKDL. The functions of mxaC and mxaD are currently not known, but the order of mxaDL is reversed in Methylobacter albus BG 8 compared to Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1. When subclones o the Methylobacter albus BG 8 fragment containing these genes were used as hybridization probes to genomic digests of methanotrophic bacteria, specific bands were detected that suggested a similar gene order in most cases.
