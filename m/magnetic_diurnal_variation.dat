40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology (or treatment) {{to establish a}} representative signal of the global <b>magnetic</b> <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> based on a spatial distribution in both longitude and latitude {{of a set of}} magnetic stations as well as their magnetic behavior on a time basis. For that, we apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique implemented using gapped wavelet transform and wavelet correlation. The continuous gapped wavelet and the wavelet correlation techniques were used to describe the features of the magnetic variations at Vassouras (Brazil) and other 12 magnetic stations spread around the terrestrial globe. The aim {{of this paper is to}} reconstruct the original geomagnetic data series of the H-component taking into account only the diurnal variations with periods of 24 hours on geomagnetically quiet days. With the developed work, we advance a proposal to reconstruct the baseline for the quiet day variations (Sq) from the PCA using the correlation wavelet method to determine the global variation of PCA first mode. The results showed that this goal was reached and encourage other uses of this approach to different kinds of analysis. Comment: Sudmitted to J. Atm. Sol-Ter. Phys. on October 5 th, 201...|$|E

Median <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in albumin excretion rate in the various groups varied from — 32 to- 57 %, and in IgG excretion rate from- 42 to — 65 %, being not significantly different between the proteins or between the groups. <b>Diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in ft-M excretion rate was similar in healthy volunteers and in patients with normal albumin excretion rate or incipient diabetic nephropathy (median — 36 to- 43 %), but significantly reduced in patients with clinical dia-betic nephropathy (median 0 %; P< 0. 005), nine of whom had elevated /^-M excretion rates, suggesting tubular dysfunction.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of mood and the clinical response to total sleep deprivation (TSD) {{was investigated in}} 43 depressed patients. The question asked was whether the propensity to produce <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> of mood or the actual mood course {{on the day before}} TSD determines the clinical response to TSD. Patients rated their mood three times daily during an experimental period of 56 days. The frequency as well as the amplitude of daily mood changes were assessed during this period. For each patient six TSDs were scheduled: two after days with a positive mood course, two after a negative mood course, and two after days without a diurnal change of mood. This strategy allowed comparisons of TSD responses within patients. Moreover, longitudinally and retrospectively assessed <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> were compared with each other. It was found that patients vary largely in the occurrence of <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> of mood. The propensity to produce <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> either in terms of frequency or amplitude was positively correlated with the response to TSD. Within patients no differences were found in responses to TSDs applied after days with <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> (positive or negative) or without <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations.</b> A second aim was to get more insight into the mechanism relating <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> of mood and the TSD response. Therefore, the interrelatedness of various measures of <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations,</b> such as amplitudes and frequencies of positive or negative diurnal mood changes, was studied, as well as the relationships of these variables with TSD responses.

40|$|A {{regional}} {{climate model}} (RCM) {{has been applied}} to simulate the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> of the Asian summer monsoon during the early summer period. The ERA 40 reanalysis data and the TRMM precipitation data are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The 5 -year simulations show that the RCM could simulate well the diurnal cycle of the monsoon circulation over the region. A strong <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of circulation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can be observed at the 500 -hPa level, with strong convergence and upward motion in the late afternoon. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of the 500 -hPa relative vorticity over the TP associated with the corresponding <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of convergence may lead to the formation of a prominent plateau-scale cyclonic circulation over the TP during the evening to midnight period.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{number of}} peak expiratory flow (PEF) {{readings}} required per day to assess <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> accurately is not known; published studies have used {{between two and}} seven PEF readings per day. This study compares the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> calculated using 2 - 10 PEF readings per day.  METHODS—All days with 10 readings were selected from a database of PEF records. For each day, <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> calculated using 2 - 9 of the readings available were compared with that calculated using the full 10 PEF readings. <b>Diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> calculated using all 10 readings was taken as the true <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation.</b> When less than 10 readings were used the readings were evenly spaced over waking hours. <b>Diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> was calculated as maximum — minimum/predicted.  RESULTS—Two hundred and 25 days with 10 readings per day were selected from PEF records provided by 63 individuals. When only two PEF readings per day were used, the limits of agreement suggested a possible underestimate of true <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation,</b> calculated using all 10 readings, of 1. 23 - 15. 10 %. The possible underestimate fell to 0. 27 - 3. 96 % when calculated using four evenly spaced readings. Analysis of {{the timing of the}} highest PEF reading of the day was undertaken for rest and work days. This showed a mean (SD) timing of 13 : 56 (4 : 56 hours) for rest days and 11 : 47 (5 : 59 hours) for work days.  CONCLUSIONS—Clinically significant underestimates of true <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> may be seen when only small numbers of PEF readings per day are used in its calculation. At and above four readings the results suggest that the underestimate becomes increasingly insignificant in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of asthma. Analysis of the timing of the highest PEF reading of the day showed a wide variation, precluding the ability to capture the true <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> with just two or three carefully timed PEF readings per day. The authors suggests that at least four readings per day should be performed, evenly spaced during waking hours, to obtain an accurate assessment of <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in PEF. ...|$|R

No <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in fractional clearance of albumin was found. Significant associations between MABP and albuminuria were demonstrated during night- (R 2 = 0. 50; P < 0. 001) and daytime (R 2 = 0. 48; P < 0. 005). A linear regression analysis between <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> in MABP and GFR showed that an increase in MABP (of 10 %) from night- to daytime was associated with a significant increase in GFR (of 8. 0 %, 0. 2 to 4. 1, P < 0. 02). ConclusionsOur study revealed <b>diurnal</b> <b>variations</b> in GFR, albuminuria and MABP in diabetic nephropathy, with lowest values during sleep at night. The observed <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in albuminuria seems to be explained partly by mechanisms related to orthostasis, and partly by the <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> in GFR and serum albumin concentration. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>variation</b> of blood pressure seems to play a role for the diurnal changes in GFR and albuminuria...|$|R
