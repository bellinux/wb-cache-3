40|$|A study {{examined}} {{the way in which}} stockpiling job applications affects a firm's search for a new employee when an opening arises {{and the extent to which}} employers make use of applications they have stockpiled. Data on these questions were obtained from a survey of 2, 264 employers that was sponsored by the National Institute of Education and the Nat'oaal Center for Research in Vocational Education in 1982. As hypothesized, stockpiling had a positive impact on extensive search as measured by the number of applicants interviewed. However, intensive search as measured by the number of hours spent per applicant significantly declined with stockpiling. Firms using the stockpiling strategy received 33 percent <b>more</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and 35 percent more visits, and they accepted 44 percent more applications. When filling a job vacancy, larger firms called prior applicants at a much higher rate (58 percent for firms with more than 250 employees versus 27 percent for firms with fewer than 10 employees). Stockpiling was most common for service jobs and least common for professional and managerial jobs. Thus, likelihood of job vacancy and lack of specialized job requirements were associated with use of the stockpiling strategy. Unionized firms were significantly mo-:e likely to interview prior applicants.

Ingate Systems AB produces firewalls specialized in handling IP telephony. They have an inherent limit {{in the number of}} concurrent phone calls that they can handle. This can be a bottleneck at high loads. There is a load balancing solution available in the platform, but it has a number of drawbacks, such as media latency and client capability requirements, limiting its usage. Many companies provide load balancing solutions for SIP. However, it appears few handle all the problematic scenarios that the Ingate firewall does. This master's thesis aims to add load balancing functionality to the Ingate firewall, so that it can handle all types of clients. By splitting the firewall into two completely separate layers - a SIP layer and a firewall layer - the concept of a virtual machine emerges. A machine is no longer restricted to its physical SIP and firewall layers. Instead, virtual machines are used to process calls. They still have SIP and firewall layers, but the layers can reside on different physical machines. This thesis demonstrates the operation of an innovative load balancing implementation. The implementation was evaluated, and using four machines the test setup performed 50 % better than the original Ingate platform, while still retaining all functionality [...] something that was not possible with the original platform.

This study is a “real-life” situation aiming to assess {{whether or not it}} is possible for COPD patients with high burden of disease to self-manage acute exacerbations and to reduce hospital use. Methods 100 randomly selected charts of patients followed in a specialised COPD clinic in 2006 and 2009 (patients with higher burden of disease) were reviewed. Data on patients' characteristics, COPD severity and exacerbation management were extracted. ResultsCompared to the 2006 cohort, patients from the 2009 cohort had lower (0. 85  L), but not statistically significant different FEV 1 (L) than the 2006 cohort (0. 98  L) and more exacerbations (2. 6 exacerbations/pt vs 3. 6 exacerbations/pt, p =  0. 03). Despite having a higher burden of disease, patients in the 2009 cohort as compared to 2006 had more appropriate self-management behaviours in the event of an exacerbation (60 % vs 42 %, p =  0. 05) and fewer emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions (39 % vs 57 %, p =  0. 02). There were <b>more</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> to the case managers (590 vs 382, p <  0. 001) and fewer physician office visits (167 vs 179, p =  0. 024).

40|$|Discrete event {{dynamical}} systems (DEDS) are a {{class of}} man-made systems, which are driven {{by a set of}} discrete events. Typical examples include queuing systems, manufacturing systems, telecommunication networks, and so on. In the past two decades, the modeling, simulation, and optimization of DEDS have received considerable attention. The objective of this thesis is to apply the DEDS approaches to study wireless personal communication systems. Two applications are studied: the call request buffering problem and the mobile terminal location tracking problem. In a personal communication service network, a set of channels is assigned to every cell. When a phone call arrives and is assigned a channel, it consumes the channel {{until the end of the}} conversation. If no channel is available, the call is dropped/blocked. In many cases, some channels may become available shortly after a call is dropped. Thus, if some buffering mechanism is used, a cell may accommodate <b>more</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and thus the channel utilization is increased. This is referred to as call request buffering. The first part of this thesis develops an algorithm to estimate the sensitivity of a Markov process using a single sample path of its uniformization Markov chain, and uses a gradient algorithm to find a locally optimal parameter. After that, a random call request buffering scheme is introduced, which is optimized using the proposed algorithm. In a wireless personal communication service system, in order to deliver a phone call, the network has to track the mobile terminals' locations from time to time. The second part of the thesis proposes a mobile terminal location update model, whose states consist of two components [...] the time elapsed since last call arrived and the distance the mobile terminal has traveled since last registration...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between informational support {{and use of}} health care services among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer remains little documented despite its importance for optimal care delivery. Aim: To document the role of informational support in light of patterns of health services used by women and men newly diagnosed with cancer. Method: A sequential mixed methods approach (i. e., quantitative-qualitative) was conducted among women and men newly diagnosed with either breast or prostate cancer. First, an existing quantitative database {{was used to determine}} whether an intervention relying on multimedia tool as a complement to the provision of usual cancer informational support to patients (N = 250) would modify subsequent health care service use. A follow-up qualitative inquiry with distinct individuals also newly diagnosed (N = 20) was conducted to explore this relationship further. Next, the resulting quantitative and qualitative findings were merged and reanalyzed using a quantitative-hierarchical approach to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon. Findings: Several personal and contextual factors were found to qualify the {{relationship between}} cancer informational support and health service use. Although quantitative analyses showed no significant differences in terms of overall reliance on health care services among participants who received more intense cancer informational support as opposed to those who received care as usual, several sex differences were noted in terms of number of visits to health care professionals, time spent with nurses and satisfaction with cancer information received. Qualitative findings revealed that participants reported a variety of experiences pertaining to cancer information received (e. g., positive, unsupportive or mixed) as well as several processes at play (e. g., cancer information seen as enabling, confirming, or conflicting). These differences in informational support, in turn, influenced their subsequent service utilization (e. g., <b>more</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> made to health professionals, reduction in face-to-face visits, reluctance to use cancer-related services). The mixed data analysis clarified further the findings allowing a broader perspective to emerge. Conclusion: Findings underscore that the relationship between cancer information and use of services is not as straightforward as initially anticipated. These findings provide initial insights that may inform future research on the topic and assist health care providers in optimizing their cancer informational interventions to guide patients in their reliance on health care services...|$|E
40|$|In Estonia {{as well as}} in {{the world}} the {{exploitation}} of the Internet has been studied more thoroughly than the exploitation of the mobile phones. Although mobile phones are widely used and the bills paid by the clients of mobile agencies are significantly bigger than those of the Internet users, the studies on exploiting mobiles have been relatively modest. Due to lack of studies There has been rapid development in mobile industry, but very few studies have been carried out in this field, so no objective regularities in the usage of mobile phones can be reviewed. Therefore, it is important to study the field constantly. As it has become apparent from the previous studies, people’s needs, habits and aims when using mobile phones are different. The analysis of using the services enabled to compare the results of present and previous studies. Questioning the clients of Tele 2 Eesti AS confirmed that the expectations and using practice depend mainly on age group and to minor extent on sex. Men are a little more active using technical services, but generally the using patterns among men and women are similar. The present study confirmed the results of previous researches which revealed that elderly people use mobile phone mainly as a means of communication and value its being handy and practical whereas younger generation use telephone also as a means of entertainment instead of MP 3 -player or photo camera. One of the aims of my study was to ascertain which qualities of a mobile phone are essential when people choose it and which mobile services, either operator’s or mobile phone’s, people are tend to use most. The present research showed that many clients consider the reliability and handiness of the mobile phone as the most important quality. Although mobile phone may be an outlet of trend, fashion or social status, it still remains a practical means of communication. In addition to making calls mobiles are often used for sending messages. At the same time several modern mobile services are not actively exploited due to lack of motivation or advertising, and some people doubt about the reliability of technology. Mobile phone as a multifunctional device is in several studies qualified as a computer in a net. In many developed Asian countries mobile phones serve as computers: reading e-mails, searching for information etc. My research does not support that thesis: in Estonia mobiles are mainly used for making calls, because they are too small and uncomfortable to use for the functions of computers. The research ascertained that mobiles are expected to be multifunctional, but only concerning such daily needs as telling the time, setting alarm, taking photos or calculating. Although mobile phones have become means of everyday work and entertainment they are not alternatives to computers, first and foremost because of their small size. The small screen and keyboard make it uncomfortable to use the mobile instead of a computer. Another aim of my paper was to find out whether people are making <b>more</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> than they used to some years ago. The results of the monitoring show that the using habits of the exploiters differ greatly depending on the type of clients but the number of calls made and the length of talking time has increased despite of the fact that several new alternative means of communication have come into being during the last years. At the same time, there is no increase in the number of sending messages. Neither has sending MMSs become very popular among the clients of Tele 2. That confirms once more the thesis that telephone is mainly a means of speaking to each other and it has not acquired the functions of a computer. In Estonia it has not been worked out how to classify the users of mobile phones. I have tried to group different exploiters and form types according to the speaking habits, usage of different services and social status. I have found seven categories of clients. As there exists a typology of the users of computers, it is advisable to think about working out the acceptable typology for mobile phone exploiters. The present study gives a survey about the exploiting of mobile phones encompassing private clients. The efficiency of the results is of biggest value to the service offer, Tele 2 Eesti AS: when knowing the requirements and habits of the clients the operators are able to develop the services offered and work out more individual approach to the customers. It is also useful to the manufacturers to be aware of the real needs and expectations of the exploiters. The results of the study help to supplement the researches carried out in Estonia on mobile communication till now...|$|E
