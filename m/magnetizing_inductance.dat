In both methods, both {{the impact of the}} skin effect on the rotor parameters and the impact of saturation on <b>magnetizing</b> <b>inductances</b> are taken into account. The ﬁrst method is based on an equivalent single-phase model of the machine. A pulsating ﬂux is imposed along the d- and q-axes separately, so as to compute the machine parameters along both d- and q-axes. <b>Magnetizing</b> <b>inductances</b> are achieved {{as a function of the}} ﬂux, and the rotor resistances and leakage inductances are obtained as a function of rotor frequency.
