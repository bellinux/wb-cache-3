5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first {{collaborated on}} a video game based on Michael Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by <b>miniature</b> <b>golf</b> and captivated by the idea that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to <b>miniature</b> <b>golf,</b> but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.|$|E
