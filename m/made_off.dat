5|$|In 1678 a local innkeeper, John Barnes was hanged {{after being}} {{found guilty of}} highway robbery. He had waylaid, {{with the help of}} accomplices, a coach {{travelling}} from Exeter to London and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with about £600 but he was recognised by the guards from Exeter, where he had been a taverner.|$|E
5|$|Finally at 7:58pm, President ceased {{fire and}} hoisted {{a light in}} her rigging, {{indicating}} that she had surrendered. Endymion ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, {{due to a lack}} of undamaged boats. Endymions foresails had been damaged in the engagement and while she hove to for repairs, Decatur took advantage of the situation and, despite having struck, <b>made</b> <b>off</b> to escape at 8.30pm; Endymion, hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8.52pm.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1817, a British sloop, William and Mary, foundered {{after hitting}} the rock islands near Flat Holm known as The Wolves (Bristol Channel). The ship {{was en route}} from Bristol to Waterford and sank within fifteen minutes. The Mate, John Outridge, and two sailors <b>made</b> <b>off</b> in the only lifeboat. Fifteen {{survivors}} were later rescued, having clung to the ship's rigging, but fifty-four other passengers were lost. Fifty of the bodies were recovered from the ship and were buried on Flat Holm.|$|E
50|$|Pareto {{inefficiency}} - Pareto {{efficiency is}} {{a situation in which}} one person can not be <b>made</b> better <b>off</b> without making anyone else worse off. In practice, this criterion is difficult to apply in a constantly changing world, so many emphasize Kaldor-Hicks efficiency and inefficiency: a situation is inefficient if someone can be <b>made</b> better <b>off</b> even after compensating those <b>made</b> worse <b>off,</b> regardless of whether the compensation actually occurs.|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his {{scouting}} frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately <b>made</b> <b>off</b> {{in the direction of}} the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was Audacieux, of Nielly's squadron. Pursuing Audacieux after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun Républicaine and 16-gun Inconnue. Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches {{the top of the}} stairs, he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to the}} motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E
5|$|Hoppner's return {{journey to}} Java {{could not be}} {{accomplished}} in less than nine days, so further supplies would be required for the 200 remaining survivors. An unarmed expedition made its way back to Alceste to see what could be salvaged, but was forced back {{by the arrival of}} Malay Dyak pirates who plundered the wreck. Maxwell ordered the construction of a stockade and the improvisation of additional weapons to counter the threat of an attack. The digging of a well solved the problem of water. On 22 February, an armed party set out to reclaim the ship but the pirates set fire to Alceste and <b>made</b> <b>off.</b> The fire lasted throughout the night and destroyed the wreck; the following morning Maxwell sent out a boat that managed to retrieve some barrels of flour, cases of wine, and a cask of ale. The pirates returned at dawn on 26 February, entering the cove aboard two proas and two canoes. Second lieutenant Hay led a sortie that boarded one of the proas, killing four pirates and capturing two more. The proa could not be brought to shore and was scuttled. More pirates arrived over the next two days. They made no attempt to land, but behaved aggressively by firing their swivel guns towards the shore. By 1 March there were fourteen pirate proas in the cove, with more arriving on the following night.|$|E

25|$|After losing {{very few}} {{men in the}} action, the Calabrians under Colonel Carey retreated to the northwest. During the night, they ran into the head of Decaen's column and had to quickly reverse course to the south. After passing behind Suchet's {{advancing}} column, Carey's men reached the coast where they were taken off by Allied shipping, having lost 51 men.

25|$|In July 1990, two armed bank robbers {{were shot}} dead by {{officers}} from the Emergency Response Unit, after they held staff and customers at gunpoint at a bank branch in Leixlip, County Kildare. William Doyle (35) from Dublin and Thomas Wilson (39) from Northern Ireland <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with thousands of pounds in notes from the bank, and after the alarm was raised they were pursued in a high-speed chase by {{officers from the}} ERU. Gardaí forcibly ended the pursuit in Fairview, Dublin, and a shootout ensued, with the heavily armed ERU team fatally shooting both suspects without injury to any other party.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 a {{group of}} {{students}} from National College of Art and Design stole the head of lord Nelson's Pillar, which had been blown up by Irish nationalists in March 1966. The head had been stored in a shed off Clanbrassil Street by Dublin City Corporation. The students broke into the shed and put the head {{in the back of a}} hatchback and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with it. The head later appeared in numerous locations most notably the set of a Dubliners concert and also ina london antique shop close to Trafalgar square where the other pillar is located.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, it was {{discovered}} that two Halberstadt residents (aged 24 and 26) had gained entry to the tunnel system through an unsecured opening and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with numerous banknotes. The two residents were convicted of the crime and sentenced to four months in prison and three years of probation. Furthermore, they had to pay €120 to a non-profit organisation. The appearance among collectors of uncirculated 200 and 500 Mark notes, and of the never-issued military currency, is attributed to this theft. Because of the theft and the slowness of the rotting, the KfW then decided to burn the old currency. Between April and June 2002, 298 containers of the currency remains were burned in an incinerator (six containers per day) along with household refuse. The last container was burned on 25 June 2002.|$|E

5000|$|The First Theorem {{is often}} {{taken to be}} an {{analytical}} confirmation of Adam Smith's [...] "invisible hand" [...] hypothesis, namely that competitive markets tend toward an efficient allocation of resources.

However, Pareto efficiency {{is not necessarily the}} same thing as desirability; it merely indicates that no one can be <b>made</b> better <b>off</b> without someone being <b>made</b> worse <b>off.</b> There can be many possible Pareto efficient allocations of resources and not all of them may be equally desirable by society.|$|R
25|$|An {{outbreak}} of measles {{in the later}} part of October 1917 kept the men from drilling. Regardless, in January, 1918, the National Guard Reserve {{was transferred to the}} active list. However, in the same month, Alexandria, Louisiana, was <b>made</b> <b>off</b> limits, and visits by other regiments were banned due to an {{outbreak of}} meningitis. During this time, the soldiers were instructed in the use of deadly gases and then exposed to tear gas. The curfew concerning Alexandria lasted until 6 March 1918. The soldiers complained about the bugs and were anxious to go to France. By March 1918, the soldiers had received new Enfield rifles. In early October, 1918, after the departure of most Arkansas soldiers, Camp Beauregard was struck by Spanish influenza which led into lobar pneumonia; all available facilities were used and hospitals became overcrowded.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Méliès {{continued}} producing successful {{films and}} was {{at the peak of}} his popularity. His films that year included The Brahmin and the Butterfly, in which Méliès portrays a Brahmin who transforms a caterpillar into a beautiful woman with wings, but is himself turned into a caterpillar. He also made the féerie Red Riding Hood and Bluebeard, both based on stories from Charles Perrault. In Bluebeard, Méliès plays the eponymous wife-murderer and co-stars with Jeanne d'Alcy and Bleuette Bernon. The film is an early example of parallel cross-cutting and match cuts of characters moving from one room to the next. The Edison Company's 1902 film Jack and the Beanstalk, directed by Edwin S. Porter, was considered a less successful American version of several Méliès films, particularly Bluebeard. That year, he also <b>made</b> <b>Off</b> to Bloomingdale Asylum, a blackface burlesque that includes four white bus passengers transforming into one large black passenger who is then shot by the bus driver.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets {{were seen}} over the skies of Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's victory speech, {{possibly}} trying {{to protect him from}} an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah told the crowd that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. In September 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli arms depot in Shomera, and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> with a large quantity of sidearms, grenades, anti-tank weapons, and LAU rockets. Five Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and attempted to search the Hezbollah-controlled village of Marwahin for the arms. They were confronted by four French Army Leclerc tanks, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed that the Israelis had turned back. French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.|$|E
