50|$|Those Materials include: Thermal (thermo-chromic, thermo-electric), Mechanical (Shape Memory Alloys and Polymers, thermo-elastic), Magnetic (magneto-elastic, <b>magneto-resistive,</b> magneto-optic, ferrofluids, Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys, etc.), Electric (photoelectric, {{advanced}} piezoelectric materials), Multiferroics, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} encoder uses {{a series of}} magnetic poles (2 or more) to represent the encoder position to a magnetic sensor (typically <b>magneto-resistive</b> or Hall Effect). The magnetic sensor reads the magnetic pole positions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magneto-resistive</b> heads {{do not use}} iron so they do {{not build}} up {{residual}} magnetism. They never need to be demagnetized, and if a cassette demagnetizer is used on MR heads, they are easily damaged or destroyed.|$|E
50|$|This tape {{format is}} based on an 8mm tape with 128 tracks {{arranged}} in an interleaved longitudinal serpentine format. The tapes used a metal particle technology, and the tape drives used a <b>magneto-resistive</b> head technology, with LZ1 data compression built into the drive. An unusual feature is the mid-tape load-point.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{principles of}} the two encoders are similar: a multichannel <b>magneto-resistive</b> sensor scans a target wheel with 256 teeth, generating sine and cosine signals. Arctangent interpolation is used to generate rectangular pulses from the sine/cosine signal periods. The precision encoder also possesses amplitude and offset correction functions. This {{makes it possible to}} further improve the signal quality, which greatly improves traction regulation.|$|E
50|$|The drives {{were known}} for {{an unusually high}} rate of head crashes, due to the {{magnetic}} coating soon beginning to loosen and sprinkle off from the platters, creating dust in the hard disk array and leading to crashes over {{large areas of the}} platters. The combination of two technologies, GMR (Giant <b>Magneto-Resistive)</b> heads on 3.5-inch glass platters, are said to be largely to blame for the issues.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to turn the tide in 1998, WDC {{recruited}} the help of IBM. This agreement gave WDC the rights to use certain IBM technologies, including giant <b>magneto-resistive</b> (GMR) heads and access to IBM production facilities. The result was the Expert line of drives, introduced in early 1999. The idea worked, and WDC regained respect {{in the press and}} among users, even despite a recall in 2000 (which was due to bad motor driver chips). WDC later broke ties to IBM.|$|E
50|$|Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling, usually {{abbreviated}} to MIDAS, is a distributed network of traffic sensors, mainly inductive loops, (trialling {{at the moment}} radar technology by Wavetronix and <b>magneto-resistive</b> wireless sensors by Clearview Intelligence) which are designed to alert the local RCC (Regional Control Centre) to traffic flow and average speeds and in ATM (Active Traffic Management) zones, set variable message signs, advisory speed limits along with mandatory speed limits in ATM sections with little human intervention. Companies such as RAC, TomTom and Google use this traffic flow data via halogens reporting systems.|$|E
50|$|DCC uses a 9-track <b>magneto-resistive</b> (MR) {{head for}} playback. The head is {{fixed to the}} {{mechanism}} of the recorder, unlike rotary heads {{that are used in}} helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS to increase head-to-tape speed. Because of the reduced number of moving parts, DCC decks are less sensitive to shock and vibration. And because of the dimensions that are so similar to analog compact cassettes, existing auto-reverse audio cassette recorder mechanisms can easily be adapted for use in DCC recorders simply by mounting a DCC head instead of only an analog head. In fact, Philips did this during development.|$|E
5000|$|A simple {{instrument}} {{can detect}} {{the presence and}} measure the total magnetic signal of a sample, however the challenge of developing an effective MIA is to separate naturally occurring magnetic background (noise) from the weak magnetically labeled target (signal). Various approaches and devices have been employed to achieve a meaningful signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for bio-sensing applications: giant <b>magneto-resistive</b> sensors and spin valves, piezo-resistive cantilevers, inductive sensors, superconducting quantum interference devices, anisotropic <b>magneto-resistive</b> rings, and miniature Hall sensors. But improving SNR often requires a complex instrument to provide repeated scanning and extrapolation through data processing, or precise alignment of target and sensor of miniature and matching size.Beyond this requirement, MIA that exploits the non-linear magnetic properties of magnetic labels [...] can effectively use the intrinsic ability of a magnetic field to pass through plastic, water, nitrocellulose, and other materials, thus allowing for true volumetric measurements in various immunoassay formats. Unlike conventional methods that measure the susceptibility of superparamagnetic materials, a MIA based on non-linear magnetization eliminates the impact of linear dia- or paramagnetic materials such as sample matrix, consumable plastics and/or nitrocellulose. Although the intrinsic magnetism of these materials is very weak, with typical susceptibility values of -10−5 (dia) or +10−3 (para), when one is investigating very small quantities of superparamagnetic materials, such as nanograms per test, the background signal generated by ancillary materials cannot be ignored. In MIA based on non-linear magnetic properties of magnetic labels the beads are exposed to an alternating magnetic field at two frequencies, f1 and f2. In the presence of non-linear materials such as superparamagnetic labels, a signal can be recorded at combinatorial frequencies, for example, at f = f1 ± 2×f2. This signal is exactly proportional {{to the amount of}} magnetic material inside the reading coil.|$|E
5000|$|A {{write head}} magnetises a region by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise {{the region and}} to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [...] "giant" [...] magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically <b>magneto-resistive</b> while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.|$|E

The <b>magneto-resistive</b> effect is exploited in several field sensing transducers, while the planar Hall-effect is not. In this paper the output of direct sensing Hall-heads is compared with <b>magneto-resistive</b> heads for a number of situations typical for magnetic recording. The comparison is based on a computational procedure which can be executed {{with the help of a}} simple calculator. The procedure and the results are presented in such a way that known results for <b>magneto-resistive</b> transducers can immediately be translated into results for Hall-transducers...|$|E

A reasonable and simple approach is presented to compensate the measurement error from <b>Magneto-resistive</b> Sensor output. Firstly, {{the principle of the}} new method is illustrated. Secondly, the steps of the error compensation are introduced. Finally, the test is carried out, results are shown that the maximum angle value of deviation is no more than 2 ° and compensation method can be used in common {{measurement system}} based on <b>magneto-resistive</b> sensors...|$|E
40|$|A {{high speed}} read MRAM memory element is {{configured}} from a sandwich of magnetizable, ferromagnetic film surrounding a <b>magneto-resistive</b> film {{which may be}} ferromagnetic or not. One outer ferromagnetic film has a higher coercive force than the other and therefore remains magnetized in one sense while the other may be switched in sense by a switching magnetic field. The <b>magneto-resistive</b> film is therefore sensitive to the amplitude of the resultant field between the outer ferromagnetic films and may be constructed of a high resistivity, high <b>magneto-resistive</b> material capable of higher sensing currents. This permits higher read voltages and therefore faster read operations. Alternate embodiments with perpendicular anisotropy, and in-plane anisotropy are shown, including an embodiment which uses high permeability guides to direct the closing flux path through the <b>magneto-resistive</b> material. High density, high speed, radiation hard, memory matrices may be constructed from these memory elements...|$|E

In these devices, a novel <b>magneto-resistive</b> memory effect has been demonstrated, related to a rearrangement of magnetic domain walls between different pairs of nanowires in the device consisting in that its zero-field resistance depends on the direction of previously applied magnetic field.

40|$|<b>Magneto-resistive</b> {{elements}} have possible {{applications in}} memories and sensors. Recently considerable {{effort has been}} directed towards the development of high density <b>magneto-resistive</b> memories. This research includes work in many areas such as obtaining cells with higher signal levels, densification of storage cells {{and the development of}} an appropriate sensing scheme. This dissertation deals with the development of latter stages of a multi stage sensing scheme for a large <b>magneto-resistive</b> memory. In this sensing scheme the signal of a actual element is compared against the signal from a dummy element. The resulting signal is stored and again is compared against a signal of opposite polarity which is generated from the same element. This process is called self referencing and is done to minimize offset problems. The special features of this sensing scheme are: the balanced sensing where the signal from the actual and the dummy elements are balanced to have identical time constants, a two stage switched capacitor auto-zero scheme where the DC offsets between the two elements due to mismatch is removed while generating very little noise and self referencing which is done by a sample and compare circuit. This self referencing process increases the bit density by 50 % and the two stage auto-zero significantly reduces read access time. The memory is nonvolatile, radiation hard and is designed to have a read access time of 800 ns...|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{the human}} brain, {{there is a strong}} effort to find {{alternative}} models of information processing capable of imitating the high energy efficiency of neuromorphic information processing. One possible realization of cognitive computing are reservoir computing networks. These networks are built out of non-linear resistive elements which are recursively connected. We propose that a skyrmion network embedded in frustrated magnetic films may provide a suitable physical implementation for reservoir computing applications. The significant key ingredient of such a network is a two-terminal device with non-linear voltage characteristics originating from single-layer magnetoresistive effects, like the anisotropic magnetoresistance or the recently discovered non-collinear magnetoresistance. The most basic element for a reservoir computing network built from "skyrmion fabrics" is a single skyrmion embedded in a ferromagnetic ribbon. In order to pave the way towards reservoir computing systems based on skyrmion fabrics, here we simulate and analyze i) the current flow through a single magnetic skyrmion due to the anisotropic <b>magneto-resistive</b> effect and ii) the combined physics of local pinning and the anisotropic <b>magneto-resistive</b> effect.

40|$|Abstract—A large {{class of}} angle sensors uses a small {{permanent}} magnet {{attached to the}} rotor. The magnet is polarized perpendicularly to the axis of rotation, and a magnetic field sensor is placed ahead on the axis. The sensor circuit consists of two full bridges at 45 ◦, each having four anisotropic <b>magneto-resistive</b> (AMR) elements. Even though the electronic system may be calibrated to have nearly no errors like offset, nonlinearity, and mismatch, still significant angle errors may result from assembly tolerances of the magnet and the sensor. This work gives an analytical description of the angle error caused by tilts and eccentricities of magnet and sensor elements against the axis of rotation. Particular emphasis is given to worst case combinations of all tolerances. One part of the angle error can be cancelled by an optimized layout of the AMR-resistors. The remaining part {{is identical to the}} case of giant <b>magneto-resistive</b> (GMR) angle sensors. Errors of both AMR and GMR angle sensors are effectively reduced by identical optimization of the shape of magnets. One such optimized shape is disclosed. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{manufacture}} and switching {{characteristics of a}} series of cobalt/aluminium oxide/permalloy magnetic tunnel junctions. It describes the assembly and commissioning of the sputtering, magnetometry and electron transport measurement equipment required to manufacture and test the junctions. The junctions are made by sputtering thin films of the ferromagnetic materials and an ultra thin film of aluminium, which is oxidised by means of a DC glow discharge. The optimum oxidation conditions for the barrier are investigated and its characteristics determined by current-voltage modelling. The barrier thickness identified by the modelling is compared with that found by x-ray reflectometry. A simple single domain model is shown to give a reasonable fit to hysteresis and <b>magneto-resistive</b> data from the junctions and to provide a means to quantify the interlayer coupling. A comparative study of the <b>magneto-resistive</b> characteristics of junctions with ferromagnetic layers of 10 nm and 100 nm finds that the thinner junctions have greater magneto-resistance and smaller interlayer coupling constants.

40|$|Temperature, {{magnetic}} induction and substitution dependent resistivity are a crucial {{factor in determining}} the physical properties of <b>magneto-resistive</b> materials. The first objective of this work was to find out an applicable method of using temperature to predict the resistivity of Pr 0. 7 (CaxSr 1 -x) 0. 3 MnO 3 in the metal phase within the transition area. Based on non-linear curve fitting, a typical numerical method is used to quantitatively analyze the temperature-dependent resistivity within temperatures lower than the metal-insulator transition temperature (Tp). The simulations agree very well with the observed curves (resistivity versus temperature). The second objective of this work is {{to search for the}} applicable method to link magneto-resistivity to {{magnetic induction}}, calculation on the principle of non-linear curve fitting, four typical numerical methods are highlighted because the magnetic induction-dependent magneto-resistivity are quantitatively analyzed by these methods. The observed effects of magnetic induction on the shift of temperature-resistive curve should be more essential in physics and are quantitatively discussed in <b>magneto-resistive</b> materials.

In this report, we present the design, calibration, and flight data analysis of the MRM. In particular, the detailed methods of pre-flight calibrations are described. The calibrated data revealed typical patterns of the global geo-magnetic field structure and of field-aligned current (FAC) distribution in the high latitude ionosphere, though the MRM of BCU only has a resolution of 24 nT and a sampling rate of 2. 22 Hz.

40|$|Perna, P. et al. [...] Comunicación presentada en la Donostia International Conference on Nanoscaled Magnetism and Applications (DICNMA), celebrada en San Sebastián del 9 al 13 de septiembre de 2013. The giant-magnetoresistance (GMR) effect {{found in}} {{multilayered}} structures composed by ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by non-magnetic spacers has attracted sustained interest {{over the past}} decades for both fundamental and technological reasons. Such effect consists in a significant change of the electrical resistance depending on the relative magnetization orientation of the FM layers, which could originate from spin-dependent scattering processes of the electrons travelling across the structure. Even though it is commonly assumed that the MR depends on the magnetic anisotropy of multilayer structures, a comprehensive description of the <b>magneto-resistive</b> behavior related to the magnetization reversal is still lacking. Experiments just relies in either magnetization (usually parallel component) or MR curves measured independently for a given applied field angle, normally close to the easy axis (e. a.) direction. We present a detailed study of the angular dependence of both <b>magneto-resistive</b> and magnetization reversa l properties in a exchange-biased spin valve structure [1]. A new experimental set-up allows us to measure simultaneously magneto-resistance and vectorial-resolved Kerr hysteresis loops, i. e., including MR and in-plane parallel and perpendicular magnetization components, at different applied field angles in the whole angular range. We advance towards a microscopic understanding of the MR properties by showing that their angular dependence leaves distinct fingerprints, which {{are directly related to}} their magnetization reversal processes. For instance, reversible and irreversible transitions are similar in both MR and vectorial-resolve magnetization curves. Well-defined MR-plateaus are observed around the e. a. direction whereas just reversible MR transitions a refound around the hard axis (h. a.) direction. The MR-plateau value decreases as the magnetic field is misaligned with respect to the e. a. and the maximum of MR decreases approaching the h. a. The results directly show that the different <b>magneto-resistive</b> behaviors originate from the magnetic anisotropy of the structure, which ultimately depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the FM layers.
