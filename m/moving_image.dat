5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum of the <b>Moving</b> <b>Image</b> in New York, and the Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience. 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E

5|$|The Government of India honoured Mani with Padma Shri in 2002. He has won several National Film Awards, Filmfare Awards, Filmfare Awards South {{and state}} awards. Apart from these awards, {{many of his}} films have been {{screened}} at various film festivals and have won numerous accolades. Geethanjali, directed by him won the Golden Lotus Award for Best Popular Film at the 37th National Film Awards. Other films like Mouna Ragam, Anjali, and Kannathil Muthamittal have won the Best Regional Film awards at the National Film Awards. Two of his films, Roja and Bombay have won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. The former was also nominated for Best Film category at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2010, Mani was honoured with Jaeger-Lecoultre Glory to the Filmmaker at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. In July 2015, he was honoured with the Sun Mark Lifetime Achievement Award at the Bagri Foundation London Indian Film Festival for his esteemed contribution to international cinema. Around the same time, the Museum of the <b>Moving</b> <b>Image,</b> New York City, paid a special tribute to Mani. His films Roja, Bombay, and Dil Se were screened at the museum as a retrospective.|$|E
5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the <b>moving</b> <b>image</b> of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} considered successive transitions between imaging {{technologies that}} render screen based <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> and interrogated how these images represent reality. Despite numerous media histories that document relationships between <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> and reality, the vital enquiry into the modulation {{of this relationship}} by distinctive technologies was not yet fully explored. My research found that analog electronic images are typically and erroneously considered to be continuous, set against the discrete nature of digital images. The often-cited analog/digital divide aligns analog video and television with the medium of film. Materially however, analog electronic reproduction is nothing like cinematographic representation. These findings substantially recast media histories describing the ontology of <b>moving</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|EP 1574162 A UPAB: 20051003 NOVELTY - The {{unit for}} {{checking}} {{the condition of}} the vocal lips of a patient is assembled of a camera (12), a monitor (14), a control unit (16) with a digital memory (17), and a lighting device (18). Other useful devices (14, 20, 24, 26) can be connected if required. The camera (12) is capable of recording in at least two of three different modes at a time. In the first the film sequence is produced with slow <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> and a high resolution level. The second mode works with faster <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> and a lower level of resolution. A one-dimensional mode recording individual scanning lines with fast <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> can also be employed by the phoniatrist. USE - The slow moving and faster <b>moving</b> <b>images</b> {{can be used in a}} system for recording the function of the vocal lips.

40|$|The {{project is}} an attempt to offer {{multiple}} viewing perspectives in a narrative. The objective is to experiment with communication via multiple screens effectively by using <b>moving</b> <b>images.</b> By <b>moving</b> <b>images,</b> I mean "a form of entertainment that enacts a story by a sequence of images giving the illusion of a continuous movement". How does interpretation/perception change when temporal (time) and spatial representations are depicted juxtaposed? By having a visible separation between the apparatus (screen/monitor), the experimentation is for the spectator to judge looking at the project in different time frames as opposed to simultaneously. The objectives is to experiment with the notion of multitasking, theory of spectator engagement (interacting with the project), viewer editing (specific ways of arranging scenes) and comic book panel's implication on <b>moving</b> <b>images.</b> For instance, can the comic book concept be adapted into <b>moving</b> <b>images?</b> The comic book concept is how imagery, words and sound are interpreted from visual representations (the comic panel) ...|$|R

40|$|Total {{comprehension}} {{and understanding of}} visual <b>images</b> (particularly <b>moving</b> <b>images)</b> {{are the result of}} a series of complex biological (brain) and mental (mind) processes and activities.
