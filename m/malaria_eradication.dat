5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National <b>Malaria</b> <b>Eradication</b> Program.

40|$|Malaria is {{the most}} {{important}} tropical vector-borne disease of humans. Despite the implementation of different initiatives for <b>malaria</b> control and <b>eradication,</b> <b>malaria</b> is still a severe problem for global public health. Plasmodium falciparum have developed resistance to virtually all antimalarials, including artemisinine derivates which are the most potent antimalarials. The antimalarial drug resistance represents a threat for <b>malaria</b> control and <b>eradication</b> programs. ^ As P. falciparum antimalarial resistance emerged and spread from areas of low malaria transmission (i. e., South America and Southeast of Asia), studies of population genetics and characterization of novel polymorphisms, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in these areas, may provide new insight to explain mechanisms of antimalarial resistance. However, population of parasites from South America has scarce information in this regard. The present research was conducted to understand the population structure and characterize genomic diversity in Colombian P. falciparum parasites. ^ We conducted a population genetic study using P. falciparum samples collected between 1993 and 2007 from the four provinces of the Colombian Pacific region.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), plasma levels of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and erythropoietin (EPO) were measured as markers of erythropoiesis.

500|$|Rockefeller Foundation {{studies showed}} in Mexico that DDT {{remained}} effective for {{six to eight}} weeks if sprayed on the inside walls and ceilings of houses and other buildings. The first field test in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings was carried out in central Italy in the spring of 1944. The objective was to determine the residual effect of the spray upon Anopheline density in the absence of other control measures. Spraying began in Castel Volturno and, after a few months, in the delta of the Tiber. The unprecedented effectiveness of the chemical was confirmed: the new insecticide was able to eradicate malaria by eradicating mosquitoes. At the end of World War II, a massive malaria control program based on DDT spraying was carried out in Italy. In Sardinia – the second largest island in the Mediterranean – between 1946 and 1951, the Rockefeller Foundation conducted a large-scale experiment to test the feasibility of the strategy of [...] "species eradication" [...] in an endemic malaria vector. Malaria was effectively eliminated in the United States by the use of DDT in the National <b>Malaria</b> <b>Eradication</b> Program (1947–52).

Such interventions require assays that reliably measure the transmission of Plasmodium from humans to Anopheles mosquitoes. Methods: We compared two commonly used mosquito feeding assay procedures: direct skin feeding assays and membrane feeding assays. Three conditions under which membrane feeding assays are performed were examined: assays with i) whole blood, ii) blood pellets resuspended with autologous plasma of the gametocyte carrier, and iii) blood pellets resuspended with heterologous control serum.

New tools, including safe and effective vaccines, are needed {{to ensure that the}} gains of the last 15 years are leveraged toward achieving the ultimate goal of <b>malaria</b> parasite <b>eradication.</b> In 2015, the European Medicines Agency announced the adoption of a positive opinion for the malaria vaccine candidate most advanced in development, RTS,S/AS 01, which provides modest protection against clinical malaria; in early 2016, WHO recommended large-scale pilot implementations of RTS,S in settings of moderate-to-high malaria transmission. In alignment with these advancements, the community goals and preferred product characteristics for next-generation vaccines have been updated to inform the development of vaccines that are highly efficacious in preventing clinical malaria, and those needed to accelerate parasite elimination. Next-generation vaccines, targeting all stages of the parasite lifecycle, are in early-stage development with the most advanced in Phase 2 trials. Importantly, progress is being made in the definition of feasible regulatory pathways to accelerate timelines, including for vaccines designed to interrupt transmission of parasites from humans to mosquitoes. The continued absence of financially lucrative, high-income markets to drive investment in malaria vaccine development points to continued heavy reliance on public and philanthropic funding...|$|R

40|$|Malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death in Kenya highlands. Malaria is a vector-borne disease and {{mosquito}} is the vector that transmits the parasites from infected people to others. Controlling mosquito larval habitats is important in eradicating malaria. Modeling the spatially distributed mosquito larval habitats is challenging. This study explores a mosquito habitat modeling approach, which integrates a Bayesian modeling method with Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). ENFA transforms original environmental variables into niche factors. These factors are extracted to maximize the variations between the global space, which represents the general conditions of an area, and the focal space, which represents habitats. The integrated method is compared with the Bayesian method without ENFA. Both methods accurately predicted the habitats approximately 70 - 80 %.
