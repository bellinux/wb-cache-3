5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

25|$|David Unaipon {{is known}} as the first {{indigenous}} author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse. A significant contemporary account of the experiences of Indigenous Australia can be found in Sally Morgan's <b>My</b> <b>Place.</b> Contemporary academics and activists including Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson are prominent essayists and authors on Aboriginal issues.|$|E

25|$|Letters {{written by}} early Aboriginal leaders like Bennelong and Sir Douglas Nicholls are {{retained}} as treasures of Australian literature, {{as is the}} historic Yirrkala bark petitions of 1963 {{which is the first}} traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the Australian Parliament. David Unaipon (1872–1967) is credited as providing the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: Legendary Tales of the Aborigines; he is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: We Are Going (1964). Sally Morgan's novel <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008) and Noel Pearson ("Up From the Mission", 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature.|$|E

25|$|Member of Parliament John H. Bryden {{put forward}} an {{amendment}} that would remove the sovereign from the oath altogether: In pledging allegiance to Canada, I take <b>my</b> <b>place</b> among Canadians, a people united by God whose sacred trust is to uphold these five principles: equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights, {{and the rule of}} law. Bryden's proposal was defeated in a vote of 189 to 31, and Bill C-63 itself never received Royal Assent; after approval by the House of Commons and a second reading in the Senate, the bill was under consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when a federal election was called, resulting in the bill's demise on the Order Paper. Subsequent Bills C-16 (2000) and C-18 (2002) also proposed the same changes to the Oath of Citizenship; the former also died on the Order Paper due to the prorogation of parliament, while the latter never made it past second reading in the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, several nightlife {{entrepreneurs}} realised the unmet social {{demands of}} the emerging gay market, and gradually allowed their establishments to cater to gay customers on certain nights. One of the earliest was The Hangar, located in a secluded area outside the city centre where, for the first time, {{a large group of}} gay men could freely congregate and even dance together. Encouraged by this precedent, homosexuals started to patronise other, mainly straight, discos in the city area such as <b>My</b> <b>Place,</b> Black Velvet, West End, El Morocco, The Library, Studio M and even the NCO Club at Beach Road. Nightclubs like Pebbles Bar located {{on the ground floor of}} the now demolished Singapura Inn Hotel, which is now the landmark of Forum Galleria in Orchard Road, Tropicana Inn, which is now Pacific Plaza and less popularly Treetops Bar at the Holiday Inn, were increasingly packing in the gays and became iconic institutions of the local gay scene. Some heterosexual clubbers complained about this, so the managements of some of these outlets were pressurised by the authorities to display signs proclaiming 'No man and man dancing' (sic). Over time, the ruling was relaxed for fast songs, but same-gender slow dancing continued to be proscribed.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, a {{compilation}} titled Lost & Found was released. It contained {{seven of the}} tracks from Guy McDonough's solo album <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> which were remastered. Compilers and producers of Lost & Found were Bill McDonough and Peter Blyton. Lost & Found tracks from <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> include [...] "Too Many People" [...] a duet sung by Guy McDonough with Colin Hay of Men at Work. Some <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> tracks used on Lost & Found have Reyne singing backing vocals. As of 2001, Bill McDonough left the music industry and began [...] working {{in the construction industry}} and continues to own and operate his building and demolition companies in 2017.|$|E

500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the moment?

[...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights." ...|$|E

60|$|As to my much demurred-to relegation of Night Falls On The Gods to the {{category}} of grand opera, I have nothing to add or withdraw. Such a classification is to me as {{much a matter of}} fact as the Dresden rising or the police proclamation; but I shall not pretend that {{it is a matter of}} such fact as everybody's judgment can grapple with. People who prefer grand opera to serious music-drama naturally resent <b>my</b> <b>placing</b> a very grand opera below a very serious music-drama. The ordinary lover of Shakespeare would equally demur to <b>my</b> <b>placing</b> his popular catchpenny plays, of which As You Like It is an avowed type, below true Shakespearean plays like Measure for Measure. I cannot help that. Popular dramas and operas may have overwhelming merits as enchanting make-believes; but a poet's sincerest vision of the world must always take precedence of his prettiest fool's paradise.|$|R

In July 2010, Jenner stated that he had filmed an alternate ending of the series with Conrad, where [...] "I [...] come back home, and basically Lauren's at <b>my</b> <b>place</b> [...] We filmed this whole lovey-dovey scene as if me and Lauren had been together this entire time", which she confirmed that September.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, [...] "I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling <b>my</b> <b>place</b> with the proper dignity is that I am only the husband, not the master in the house." [...] The Queen's household was run by her former governess, Baroness Lehzen. Albert referred to her as the [...] "House Dragon", and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.|$|E

It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was <b>my</b> <b>place</b> in the universe, always felt like it was in my blood." ...|$|E
