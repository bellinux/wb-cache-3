40|$|Abstract—Addressing demand {{uncertainty}} {{is a research}} focus in supply chain management in recent years. In this paper, a new postponement strategy is applied. Postponement has been appreciated recently, especially in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>period</b> of realizing mass customization. It has also been much used {{to respond to the}} demand uncertainty and usually considered in the planning period. However, the decision role of postponement in the supplying process was little focused. It seems simple to utilize the intuitive concept of postponement to deal with demand uncertainty, but in effect there are so many factors and problems needing to be considered that the likely simple utilization becomes rather complex. In order to execute postponement, the strategy used in this paper relies much on the cooperation among the supply chain members. Based on the assumption of ideal cooperation, a linear programming model is established and demonstrated feasible and optimal in the supply chain scheduling under an uncertain demand environment, using postponement as rescheduling strategy.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{scheduling}} problem in assembly islands environment with fixed layouts. A fixed-position assembly line is always used when products (e. g., ships and planes) are too fragile, large or heavy to move. In such configuration, products normally remain in one location for its entire <b>manufacturing</b> <b>period</b> while machines, materials and workers are moved to an assembly site called an assembly island. Such layouts can afford necessary flexibility and competitive operational efficiency for products of modest variety and production volumes. However, the high dynamics of material, equipment and manpower flows in assembly islands make the production scheduling quite difficult. The authors give the definition and mathematical model for the scheduling problem. A two-level genetic algorithm is used to obtain a near optimal solution to minimize the makespan. Experimental results show that this algorithm is more effective in airline or ship industrial manufactures than in other machine or tool final assembly companies. It also can be found that some function {{of the number of}} jobs and the number of islands is the most important factor to the time of scheduling. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
