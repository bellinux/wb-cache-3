As special {{mechanical}} systems within transmissions of unconventional motions, noncircular gears still offer multiple research opportunities {{due to their}} various geometries and kinematics characteristics. Investigation on noncircular gears highlights {{the lack of information}} on gears with combination of constant and variable speed, also named <b>multispeed</b> gears, recommended for industrial applications that require uniform speeds for different parts of a cycle, with a smooth transition between the parts. Therefore, in this paper the design of <b>multispeed</b> gears pitch curves is taken into account, as the first important step in the gear design procedure.

In simulations, the derived space-filling <b>multispeed</b> models, together with the stream-collision scheme, demonstrate better capability in simulating flows with finite Froude number.

40|$|Up to {{one third}} of the {{electricity}} supplied to a data center is required for the operation of the storage subsystem. A typical data-center workload, characterized by short idle periods, prevents traditional disk power management (DPM) from saving energy. This paper starts with an analysis of DPM’s traditional timer-based disk spin-down policy. Next, we examine how a <b>multispeed</b> disk adapts DPM to datacenter workloads. Finally, we determine how to shape the workload to enable DPM on conventional server disks. All analysis is based on an analytical model for the energy consumed by a disk during an idle period. In addition, we assume standby power to be non-negligible. The results are that (1) the competitive ratio of a threshold-based disk spindown policy depends on the ratio of standby power to idle power, (2) the notion of break-even time can be generalized for <b>multispeed</b> disks, and (3) DPM saves most energy when mean idle time and idle-time variance are maximized. With this analysis, the authors intend to stimulate the design of new data-center file and storage systems that optimally exploit DPM to save energy. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Pure {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) provide a unique problem in powertrain design through {{the meeting of}} performance specifications whilst maximising driving range. The consideration of single speed and <b>multispeed</b> transmissions for {{electric vehicles}} provides two strategies for achieving desired range and performance specifications. Through the implementation of system level vehicle models, design analysis, and optimisation, this paper analyses the application of both single speed and two-speed transmission applications to electric vehicles. Initially, transmission ratios are designed based on grade and top speed requirements, and impact on vehicle traction curve is evaluated. Then performance studies are conducted for different transmission ratios using both single speed and two-speed powertrain configurations to provide a comparative assessment of the vehicles. Finally, multivariable optimisation {{in the form of}} genetic algorithms is employed to determine an optimal gear ratio selection for single speed and two-speed PEVs.
