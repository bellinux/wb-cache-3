5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a <b>mounting</b> <b>rack.</b> The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} {{computing}} power and stackability of pizza box systems also made them attractive {{for use in}} data centers. Systems originally designed for desktop use were placed on shelves inside of 19&#8209;inch racks, sometimes requiring that part of their cases be cut off {{in order for them}} to fit. Since the late 1990s, pizza boxes have been a common form factor in data centers or industrial applications where rack space and density are critical.

40|$|THE NRC CT- 133 {{aircraft}} {{has been}} used for wake turbulence research, over a period of five years. More recently, underwing sensor pod development has been completed, for the conduct of jet aircraft emission flight research, with the intention of being able to fully measure various aspects of emissions holistically, over the whole of the aircraft wake regimes. Critical airworthiness issues included the loads that the aircraft and pods would be subjected to, in the wake turbulence regimes of wakes, and the trailing-pair wake vortex regime in particular. NRC CT- 133 wake turbulence data without the pods has been analysed and transformed to the pod CG locations, and resulting reactions derived for the pod <b>mounting</b> <b>rack</b> attachment bolt locations, the critical loading points. The resulting pod <b>mounting</b> <b>rack</b> attachment bolt loads have been parametrically related for wake turbulence parameters. When installed, the pods were fitted with accelerometers and accelerations measured, from which loads have been derived. These loads have been compared with those estimated for wake vortex encounter data without the pods. The pods mounting bolts loads were within the airworthiness safety limit. 9 2012 by The Crown in Right of Canada. Published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

40|$|Tachistoscopes allow brief visual {{stimulation}} delivery, which {{is crucial for}} experiments in which subliminal presentation is required. Up to now, tachistoscopes have had shortcomings with respect to timing accuracy, reliability, and flexibility of use. Here, we present a new and inexpensive two-channel tachistoscope that allows for exposure durations in the submillisecond range with an extremely high timing accuracy. The tachistoscope consists of two standard liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitors of the light-emitting diode (LED) backlight type, a semipermeable mirror, a <b>mounting</b> <b>rack,</b> and an experimental personal computer (PC). The monitors have been modified to provide external access to the LED backlights, which are controlled by the PC via the standard parallel port. Photodiode measurements confirmed reliable operation of the tachistoscope and revealed switching times of 3 [*]μs. Our method may also be of great advantage in single-monitor setups, in which it allows for manipulating the stimulus timing with submillisecond precision in many experimental situations. Where this is not applicable, the monitor can be operated in standard mode by disabling the external backlight control instantaneously...|$|E
