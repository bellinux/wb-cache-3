5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} of Avaris by Manfred Bietak have shown that Ahmose had a palace {{constructed}} {{on the site of the}} former Hyksos capital city's fortifications. Bietak found fragmentary Minoan-style remains of the frescoes that once covered the walls of the palace; there has subsequently been much speculation as to what role this Aegean civilization <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> in terms of trade and in the arts.|$|E
5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.|$|E
5|$|Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact {{narratives}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> {{a role in}} the group's {{development of}} space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s. Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies greatly from most of the UFO movement, particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> {{a role in}} the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could {{have been one of the}} factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> {{a part in the}} killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|John Rice, a boy actor {{with the}} King's Men, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> Lady Macbeth in a {{performance}} of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611. The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per Formans for Common Policy. His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor {{and may have been}} played by a man in early performances.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates {{that they may have}} started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> more heavily {{in the minds of the}} review panel.|$|E
5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E

50|$|Set plays {{are often}} {{utilized}} for specific situations {{such as a}} penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations {{that they can use}} to beat the defensive team. The coach <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>plays</b> that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them.|$|R

5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to have been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Irwin {{was born}} in 1858 in Toronto, Ontario, to an Irish {{blacksmith}} and a Canadian mother. As a child, he moved {{with his family to}} Boston and attended school there. He played local amateur baseball from 1873 until he was recruited by the Worcester Ruby Legs of the National Association in 1879. In late 1879, manager Frank Bancroft took Irwin and most of the other Worcester players on a baseball tour that included visits to New Orleans and Cuba. The team, which traveled under the name of the Hop Bitters, returned to the United States after only a few days due to financial and contractual difficulties. The team <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> as few as two games in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the rest}} of the tour some songs were dropped, at certain shows. [...] "Wild Horses" [...] was likely played at the 1st Newcastle show and almost {{definitely}} at the 2nd Newcastle show. It was likely played at other shows. Sympathy For The Devil <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>played</b> as the first encore, with Let It Rock as the second encore, at the 2nd Newcastle 2nd. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>played</b> at other shows. It has also been suggested that the band attempted Can't You Hear Me Knocking at least once early in the tour.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> {{a major role in}} nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought {{to rein in the}} assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
