50|$|Perhaps {{because of}} its positive, open, and empathic stance on human nature as a whole {{as well as the}} individual, self {{psychology}} {{is considered one of the}} “four psychologies” (the others being drive theory, ego psychology, and object relations); that is, one of the primary theories on which modern dynamic therapists and theorists rely.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} criteria currently used to classify {{the diagnosis of}} binge eating disorder (BED) are valid and appropriate. Method: We review evidence that reflects on {{the validity of the}} current cri-teria for binge eating episodes and BED, using literature retrieved through <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> and psychiatry search engines (e. g., PsycInfo, PubMed). Results: Evidence from experimental research points to the relative importance of episode frequency, the amount of food consumed at episodes, the subjective sense of loss of control over eating, and several additional criteria associated with binge episodes in BED. Evidence on the differences in psychopathology between BED and bulimia nervosa and between BED and obesity without binge eating, as related to diagnostic criteria, is reviewed. Conclusion: Although evidence con-cerning the diagnostic criteria of BED is mixed, broadening certain diagnostic criteria for binge eating episodes and BED might more accurately reflect the research literature and increase the num-ber of individuals eligible for inclusion in treatment programs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{widespread}} {{reluctance to}} share published research data is often hypothesized {{to be due}} to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{have found}} that disrespectful {{behaviour}} can have a notable psychological impact on victims and observers thereof. It is not surprising, therefore, that law and all the <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> codes of ethics acknowledge the principle {{of respect for the}} dignity of persons. The practical implications of this principle, however, are not clear. In this article we argue, with reference to the philosophical roots of the principle, that there are rules of manners in all societies that describe how people should demonstrate respect for persons. Generally, the profession cannot require psychologists to adhere to the rules of manners, not even those that demonstrate respect for persons, but it can, and does, prescribe to psychologists how they should act while they practice as psychologists. We proceed to examine the principles and standards of the Australian Psychology Society 2 ̆ 7 s Code of Ethics (2007) that require psychologists to demonstrate respect for persons while acting as psychologists...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{a rise in}} {{the number}} of studies looking at the {{relationship}} of psychosocial factors (coping style, personality type, and social support) on HIV/AIDS severity, there remains a lack of conclusive answers about the specific association between these factors. This study used a meta-analytic method of analysis to address these issues in the post anti-retroviral treatment modality world. A systematic search of <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> and medical computerized databases led to 110 studies used in the meta-analysis. Social support was found to have the strongest relationship with HIV progression. Structural social support had greater protective effect on HIV progression than functional social support. A significant relationship between coping type and HIV severity was found, with a greater protective benefit seen in studies that utilized CD 4 count as the outcome variable. Positive coping had a beneficial effect on HIV progression while passive and negative coping had a detrimental effect on disease progression. Among studies of personality, a weak relationship was found between personality type and HIV severity. In conclusion, the meta-analytical review found significant associations between psychosocial factors and HIV severity that could be used to refine individual treatment plans for people living with HIV/AIDS...|$|E
40|$|This study {{documents}} reporting {{errors in}} a sample of over 250, 000 p-values reported in eight <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> journals from 1985 until 2013, using the new R package “statcheck. ” statcheck retrieved null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) results from over half of the articles from this period. In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called “co-pilot model,” and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one’s own manuscript or during the review process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In a study ofninety college se-niors, {{measures}} ofexposure {{to print}} pre-dicted {{individual differences in}} vocabu-lary and cultural literacy after differ-ences in general ability (SAT scores) had been statistically controlled, but did not predict differences in grade point mw-age or knowledge {{of the field of}} <b>major</b> (<b>psychology).</b> Measures of exposure to nonprint media (television and films) predicted variance in cultllral literacy, but not in vocabulary, after cognitil'e ability had been controlled. The data challenge the view that knowledge ac-quisition is determined only by the effi-ciency of cognitive components that en-code and store information. Instead, the results indicate that differences in expo-sure to information are asignijicant in-dependent contriblltor to differences in knowledge across individuals. The inves-tigation further demonstrated the con-vergent validity of two briefly adminis-tered indicators ofindMdual differences in exposure to print. Disputes about the origin of individ-ual differences in acquired knowledge are a recurring source of contention within educational, developmental, and cognitive psychology. Some theories place great emphasis on differences in environmental opportunities, whereas others place greater emphasis on differ-ences in the ability to encode and store information. Explaining individual dif-ferences in vocabulary provides a case in point. Considerable evidence indicates that children's vocabulary sizes arc cor-related with parental education and indi-cators of environmental quality (Hall...|$|E
40|$|No {{scientific}} worker has a fixed {{level of}} significance at which from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case {{in the light of}} his evidence and his ideas. (Ronald A. Fisher, 1956, p. 42) It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything {{as if it were a}} nail. (A. H. Maslow, 1966, pp. 15 – 16) One of us once had a student who ran an experiment for his thesis. Let us call him Pogo. Pogo had an experimental group and a control group and found that the means of both groups were exactly the same. He believed it would be unscientific to simply state this result; he was anxious to do a significance test. The result of the test was that the two means did not differ significantly, which Pogo reported in his thesis. In 1962, Jacob Cohen reported that the experiments published in a <b>major</b> <b>psychology</b> journal had, on average, only a 50 : 50 chance of detecting a medium-sized effect if there was one.
