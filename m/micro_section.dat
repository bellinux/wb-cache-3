40|$|The {{ambition}} {{of this work}} {{was to determine the}} influence of surface treatment of zinc containing gold alloys on blistering in opaque layer. For this purpose several test specimens were produced. A zinc free, a zinc containing and an increased zinc containing alloy were used. For each alloy twelve series consisting of seven test specimens were manufactured. The test specimens revealed different surface treatments. Per alloy there was one series made by manufacturer instruction, these were used as the control group. The test specimens according to the series they belonged to were veneered in the same way with ceramic material and then bond strength tested using the SCHWICKERATH - test which is defined in DIN EN ISO 9693 : 2000 [1]. Subsequent the veneering ceramic material was removed completely from the test specimens by fracturing it down. In the oversight of the surface break the remaining surface coverage opaque layer on the alloy was determined. Finally there was a longitudinal <b>micro</b> <b>section</b> of the test specimen of each series produced, which was lowest bond strength tested by the SCHWICKERATH – test. These test specimens were examined digital microscopically for gas inclusions in the opaque layer. Generally it was noticed, that the bond strength of the zinc free alloy has been higher than for the zinc containing alloys. The observation led to the conclusion, that the experimental increased zinc containing amount affected slightly negative the bond strength. Oxide firing induced rising tendency of bond strength. The reduction of the oxid layer by acid or sandblast seemed thereby tend to have a positive effect. If a paste or powder opaque should be used continues to be dependent on the manufacture instruction. It turns out that it was of advantage to use a powder opaque with a alloy containing zinc. There is no full explanation with the undertaken investigations. Fact is that no increased blistering was observed. Even if it can be clinically observed that a context between large bubbles occurring when there is use of a bio alloy and paste opaque, this has not been proven experimentally. Why clinically in the veneering of bio alloys with paste opaque occasionally formations of large gas bubbles remain is unclear. It is observed that with large gas bubbles in opaque, the opaque extensively lift off the alloy surface. On the relevant alloy surface hardly any detectable opaque remains, on the bubble interior side of the veneering are usually no visible alloy oxides to found [2]. _______________________________________________________________________ 1.

40|$|Avocado juice has {{a bright}} yellow appearance, smooth mouth feel, {{excellent}} flavor and high nutritional value, but owing to its high content of crude lipid and crude protein, unstable phenomenon like phase separation, creaming, flocculation, etc. are easily produced. This study examines the effects of different micronization homogeneous model systems (waring blender, polytron and APV) on the turbidity stability and physicochemical changes of avocado juice, which can be provided as references for food processors in the quality improvement of avocado juice. The research findings showed that the avocado juice produced in the waring blender homogeneous system had better color and turbidity stability {{than that of the}} polytron homogeneous system. The color and turbidity stability was higher when the speed was higher. The results of the effects of high-pressure homogenization system (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500 bar) and different homogenization cycles (1 - 5) on the turbidity and quality of avocado juice showed that along with the increase in homogenization pressures and cycles, the outer appearance of the avocado juice became smoother, brighter and the d 4, 3 particle size was decreased and the turbidity stability was also increased. However, if the homogeneous pressure or cycles were too high, there was a decrease in the turbidity stability and brightness of avocado juice. In this experiment, the avocado juice at 1500 bar showed that the turbidity stability was the best (63. 44 %), the particle size distribution was denser and more average. The percentage volume of the big particle size (> 48. 27 μm) was lower, about 10. 49 %. The d 4, 3 was 14. 39 ± 0. 79 μm and the d 3, 2 was 5. 35 ± 0. 21 μm; the color was the brightest (71. 84 ± 1. 15); the browning index was the lowest (83. 60); viscosity was 394. 32 cps. The reason for the decrease in the viscosity was due to the changes {{in the size of the}} particles and an increase in the temperatures. The water-soluble pectin was 21. 46 ± 1. 97 AGA mg/ 100 mL. This could be due to the reason that the pressures were too high, thereby, causing the breaking of hydrocolloid. Appropriate homogeneous pressures and cycles can increase the turbidity stability of turbid juice and decrease the browning reaction of the juice. This can be used as references for the manufacturing of turbid juices or similar products. It was found that the storage of high-pressure homogenization treated avocado juice at 4 ℃ and 25 ℃ caused coagulation, bad color and outer appearance due to the decrease in particle size and increase in charge exposure. There was an increase in the coagulated solids along with an increase in the homogeneous pressures. This can be due to the reason that after the avocado juice was treated under high homogeneous treatments, there was a decrease in the average particle size; the charge exposure became acute, and there was a considerable increase in coagulation, water soluble protein, water soluble pectin and total phenol contents. When stored at 25 ℃, the avocado juice that was not treated under high homogeneous pressures, produced bad odor after storing for 16 hours. The avocado juice treated at 500 bar, produced bad odor after storing for 20 hours. The avocado juice treated at 1000 bar and 1500 bar, produced bad odor only after storing for 24 hours. From this, it can be shown that avocado juice can be stored at low temperatures. After treating avocado juice under high homogeneous pressures, the mouth feel became smoother and finer, the color became brighter; however, the bad phenomenon caused during storage must be overcome. 酪梨汁外觀呈亮麗黃(綠) 色，口感細緻，風味佳及營養價值高，因其粗脂質、粗蛋白含量高，容易發生分層、上浮、凝聚等不安定情形。本研究主要探討不同微化均質系統(Waring blender、Polytron及APV) 對酪梨汁混濁安定性及理化性質變化之影響，藉以作為食品加工業者改善酪梨汁品質之參考。 實驗結果：Waring blender均質處理酪梨汁之色澤及混濁安定度優於Polytron均質處理酪梨汁，且轉速越快，其色澤亮度與混濁安定度越高；高壓均質系統(0 、 250 、 500 、 750 、 1000 、 1250 、 1500 bar) 和不同均質循環次數(1 - 5 次) ，對酪梨汁混濁安定性及品質影響之實驗結果顯示：隨著均質壓力及循環次數增加，酪梨汁外觀愈呈細緻、亮麗，體積平均粒徑隨之減少，混濁安定度隨之增加；另均質壓力太高或均質循環次數過多，則造成酪梨汁混濁安定性及亮度下降。本實驗以 1500 bar均質酪梨汁，其混濁安定性最佳(63. 44 %) ，粒徑分佈較集中、均勻，大粒徑顆粒(> 48. 27 μm) 之體積百分比最少，僅有 10. 49 %，體積平均粒徑為 14. 39 ± 0. 79 μm，面積平均粒徑為 5. 35 ± 0. 21 μm，色澤最亮(71. 84 ± 1. 15) ，褐變指標最小(83. 60) ，黏度為 394. 32 cps，水溶性果膠含量為 21. 46 ± 1. 97 AGA mg/ 100 mL。其黏度下降和粒徑變小及溫度升高有關；均質壓力如太高，易使膠體崩解；適當的均質壓力及均質循環次數，能使混濁果汁之混濁安定性增加及減少果汁之褐變反應的進行，可作為混濁果汁或相關產品之製程參考。經高壓均質處理酪梨汁貯存於 4 ℃及 25 ℃，在貯存期間皆會有凝塊現象、不良色澤及外觀產生，且凝固增加量會隨著均質壓力提高而增加，其造成原因可能是經高壓均質處理後，其平均粒徑變小，電荷曝露情形更為嚴重，凝固現象和水溶性蛋白質、水溶性果膠及總酚含量之變化有高度相關性。 酪梨汁經高壓均質處理後，其口感更為滑順、細膩、色澤更為亮麗，但易在貯存期間，發生褐變、凝塊等不安定的現象，如何改善酪梨汁均質後品質及修飾技術之研究將成為另一研究主題。中文摘要	i Abstract 	iii 目錄 	vi 圖表索引	x 壹、前言	 1 貳、文獻回顧	 3 一、酪梨(avocado) 之簡介	 3 (一) 酪梨	 3 (二) 酪梨之組成分及營養	 3 (三) 酪梨後熟品質變化	 8 (四) 酪梨產品加工過程品質變化	 9 二、我國蔬果汁市場	 10 三、蔬果汁之品質因子與混濁安定性	 11 (一) 蔬果汁混濁安定現象	 17 (二) 蔬果汁混濁安定性影響因子	 18 1. 蔬果汁粒徑大小	 18 2. 蔬果汁組成分	 19 (1) 澱粉及其衍生物	 19 (2) 果膠或細胞壁物質	 20 (3) 蛋白質及多酚之反應物	 21 (4) 蛋白質和果膠的交互作用	 23 (5) 金屬離子與蔬果汁之互動性	 23 3. 混濁沉澱與粒子電荷之互動性	 24 四、微(奈) 化均質技術之應用	 27 參、材料與方法	 32 一、實驗材料	 32 二、實驗藥品	 32 三、實驗器材	 33 四、試驗設計	 34 (一) 不同固、液比酪梨汁對其理化性質之影響	 34 (二) 以微化均質系統評估酪梨汁粒徑與混濁安定性之影響	 34 (三) 超高壓均質對酪梨汁混濁安定性影響之研究	 34 (四) 溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁粒徑及理化性質之影響	 35 五、分析方法	 35 (一) 基本成分分析	 35 1. 水分(Moisture) 	 35 2. 粗脂肪(Crude lipid) 	 35 3. 粗蛋白質(Crude protein) 	 36 4. 灰分(Ash) 	 36 5. 粗纖維(Crude fiber) 	 36 6. 無氮化合物(Nitrogen free Extracts) 	 37 (二) 色澤分析(Color analysis) 	 37 (三) 可溶性果膠含量(Soluble pectin content) 	 37 (四) 水溶性蛋白質含量(Soluble protein content) 	 38 (五) 總酚含量(Total phenol content) 	 39 (六) 單寧含量(Tannins content) 	 39 (七) 黏度(Viscosity) 	 40 (八) 混濁度(Turbidity) 	 40 (九) 混濁安定度(Turbidity stability) 	 40 (十) 粒徑分析(Particle size analysis) 	 41 (十一) 油脂氧化(Lipid oxidation) 	 41 (十二) 凝固量測試(Coagulation %) 	 41 (十三) 蛋白質染色切片(Inspection of dyed protein <b>micro</b> <b>section)</b> 	 42 (十四) 官能品評(Sensory evaluation) 	 42 (十五) 統計分析(Statistic analysis) 	 43 肆、結果與討論	 45 一、酪梨之基本成分分析	 45 二、固、液比對酪梨汁對理化性質之影響	 45 三、以微化均質系統評估酪梨汁粒徑與混濁安定性之影響	 52 1. 均質系統對酪梨汁粒徑之影響	 52 2. 均質系統對酪梨汁黏度之影響	 53 3. 均質系統對酪梨汁色澤之影響	 58 4. 均質系統對酪梨汁混濁度之影響	 60 四、超高壓均質處理對酪梨汁混濁安定性之影響	 60 (一) 不同均質壓力之影響	 60 1. 粒徑分佈	 60 2. 物化性質分析	 68 (1) 色澤分析	 68 (2) 黏度	 71 (3) 果膠含量	 71 3. 混濁度與混濁安定度	 73 (二) 不同循環次數之影響	 73 1. 粒徑分佈	 73 2. 物化性質分析	 74 (1) 色澤分析	 74 (2) 黏度	 75 (3) 果膠含量	 75 3. 混濁度與混濁安定度	 75 五、溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁粒徑及品質之影響	 86 1. 溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁粒徑之影響	 86 2. 溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁色澤之影響	 90 3. 溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁pH值與凝固現象之影響	 96 4. 溫度貯存條件對高壓均質酪梨汁油脂氧化程度之影響	 97 六、酪梨汁混濁安定機制	 103 伍、結論	 107 陸、參考文獻	 10...|$|E

30|$|The {{cause of}} this false {{evaluation}} of the adhesive by the ultrasound system {{can be explained by}} the path of the ultrasonic wave along the outer sheet. To achieve sufficient sound energy and to compensate for possible losses due to air bubbles in the water coupling, the first six elements of arrays A or B sound towards the adjacent array C. Disregarding the opening angle of the transmitted ultrasonic wave and any present side lobes, an area of 2.3  mm is excited in the front part of the seam bond, whereas <b>micro</b> <b>sections</b> of the laboratory samples show the length of the seam channel to be approximately 0.8  mm. As a result, the predominant part of the sound path lies in the seam areas a and b, where the ultrasonic wave interacts with any adhesive which may be present. A shortening of the propagation path within seam areas a and b can be achieved by reducing the elements emitting the sound. However, this is associated with a significant decrease in signal stability and an accompanying reduction in the repeatability of the measurement.|$|R

40|$|The {{technical}} definition of ‘wood’ is well accepted, but its botanical understanding remains vague.

This universal principle of plant growth and stabilization, accounting for all taxonomic units within vascular plants, suggests that the classical life form separation into herbs, shrubs and trees is not valid. An anatomical-based differentiation between ‘wood’, ‘woody’ and ‘woodiness’ is also only meaningful if supplemented by insight on the particular plant section and its lignified proportion. We therefore recommend utilizing the botanically more neutral term ‘stem anatomy’ instead of ‘wood anatomy’, which further implies integration of the xylem and bark of all terrestrial plants.

40|$|BACKGROUND : A {{relatively}} new {{development in the}} arena of prostatic histopathological study is the premalignant proliferative changes in the glandular epithelium, possibly relating to carcinoma. Two major categories have come up, namely prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). AIMS : The aims of present study were to identify foci of the two putative premalignant conditions viz. PIN and AAH in ducto-acinar lining epithelia of 200 prostatectomy specimens and their association with nodular hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma prostate. MATERIAL AND METHODS : <b>Micro</b> <b>sections</b> from 200 prostatectomy specimens, received in the Department of Pathology, PGIMS, Rohtak, were extensively studied for the presence and association of premalignant conditions. Significant values were obtained by employing Chi-square (x 2) test, with P value &# 60; 0. 05 as significant. RESULTS : Out of 177 cases of nodular hyperplasia, 53 (29. 9 &#x 0025;) showed PIN and 38 (20. 3 &#x 0025;) showed presence of AAH. All 6 cases (100 &#x 0025;) of pure carcinoma revealed foci of PIN. Out of the remaining 23 cases of carcinoma with nodular hyperplasia, foci of PIN were observed in 16 cases (94. 1 &#x 0025;) and AAH in 2 cases (11. 7 &#x 0025;). High-grade PIN was observed in 20 cases (86. 9 &#x 0025;) of the total 23 cases of carcinoma, with/without nodular hyperplasia and 20 cases (11. 2 &#x 0025;) of nodular hyperplasia. Low-grade PIN was observed in 33 cases (18. 6 &#x 0025;) of nodular hyperplasia and in only 1 case (5. 8 &#x 0025;) of carcinoma prostate with nodular hyperplasia. CONCLUSION : PIN, especially high-grade type was the most commonly observed premalignant lesion, in cases of adenocarcinoma, thereby suggesting it to be the likely precursor of carcinoma prostate.

The purpose of this work was to look at some practical possibilities of characterising the impregnation level achieved in some consolidation treatments with different solutions of a frequently employed synthetic polymer (Paraloid B 72) and waxes (beeswax and modified paraffins as melts or in combination with linseed oil) using a simple optical microscopy technique in conjunction with an original method of samples preparation. For this purpose were used small samples of sound, not degraded spruce (Picea abies Mill), which were impregnated by short time immersion. The examination in transmitted light (TLM) of the cross-cut <b>micro</b> <b>sections</b> and in reflected light (RLM) of the wooden blocks allowed the visualisation of the consolidation products and their distribution in the wood structure, but this was easier for the consolidants with high solids content (waxes), which partly filled the lumens, and much more difficult and relative in the case of the diluted Paraloid solutions which did not fill the lumens but only impart a very shiny, highly reflective aspect of the treated areas. In order to objectively appreciate the retention and penetration of consolidants into wood the method using ImageJ, a useful image processing software, was used to process the micrographs so that some quantitative estimations of the variation of the impregnation level with the penetration depth were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) {{continue}} to be the global ‘flavour of the month’ in international development. They are regarded as “outside” actors perceived to work {{in the interests of the}} poor, and in the absence of the state, many NGOs have taken on vital role in the provision of basic services to the poor. The institutional and political environment is attuned to privatisation in whatever form it takes. NGOs are another expression of this trend, but in the case of NGOs no real disillusionment phase has yet set in. But still NGOs remain the favoured vehicle for grass-roots involvement and community development in many countries. The present paper seeks to delineate the role of NGOs in micro finance and study their aggregate impact on poverty reduction in rural Pakistan as a result of micro finance efforts. The paper is organised in four sections. Section I commences with the concepts, promises and limitations of NGOs as a vehicle of <b>micro</b> finance. <b>Section</b> II summarises the record of performance of NGOs in Pakistan. In particular, the role, achievements and set-backs of two noted NGOs in Pakistan, Agha Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) and National Rural Support Programme (NRSP). Which are studied by examining aggregate impact of these NGOs on poverty reduction as result of their <b>micro</b> finance efforts. <b>Section</b> III examines the poverty profile and presents summary of the role of NGOs in the context of poverty lending and, finally Section IV concludes the analysis and proposes some policy recommendations. ...|$|R

My primary objective in composing this piece of music was to create a modern musical work based heavily on music of the Renaissance. Representative pieces of music on which I have modeled my work include Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, Bruckner's Mass in E Minor, Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Poulenc's Mass in G, Kodàly's Missa Brevis, Stravinsky's Mass (1948), Walton's Missa Brevis, P̈̈ärt's Berliner Messe, and Bach's B Minor Mass. Many of the more recent works, the Bruckner, Vaughan Williams, and Kodàly's for instance, are rooted in musical practices of the Renaissance. The Kyrie is written in the traditional tripartite form. Each major section also contains three smaller <b>micro</b> <b>sections.</b> The Gloria is set to alternating sections of polyphony and homophony sung by the tutti chorus and soloists. The third movement, Sanctus, has an ABAB form. Each A section consists of a Soprano solo that encompasses the text of the Sanctus and Benedictus, except for the last line. The line "Hosanna in excelsis," which occurs at the end of both texts is set for all voices in an antiphonal style. Angus Dei features a presentation and two repetitions/variations of music on the text "Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi: Miserere nobis," followed by a statement of the text "dona nobis pacem. " "Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi" is always stated by a group of soloists, while the entire choir and a large contingent of instruments realize the remaining text...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} {{of poverty and}} income inequality in less developed countries (LDCs) {{is a source of}} serious concern to development economists. To understand the structure of inequality, several researchers using a variety of methodologies have measured the importance of various contributory factors to overall income variability. The available literature—which now includes studies of Brazil, Mexico, Iran, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Pakistan, and Colombia—has been reviewed elsewhere (Fields, forthcoming). This paper presents additional evidence for urban Colombia, in the process raising some important methodological issues which bear on the design of future research studies. The data set used in this paper is described in Section I. The decomposition of Colombian inequality by functional income source is presented in <b>Section</b> II for <b>micro</b> data. <b>Section</b> III examines the robustness of source decomposition procedures to data aggregation.

40|$|The aim of our {{paper is}} to discuss the {{problems}} of operationalizing the concept of a. cost-of-living-index. (COLI). For this purpose we are first undertaking a theoretical analysis of Diewert’s theory of superlative index numbers as one possible approach to approximate a COLI. We show that Diewert. s superlative index approach is arguable in many points and that the approach requires restrictive assumptions which {{are not likely to}} be met in observed households behaviour. To get a better idea about the deviation of observed households behaviour from the neoclassical assumptions about utility maximizing behaviour, we are estimating an Almost Ideal Demand System and a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System with cross <b>section</b> <b>micro</b> data from the German income and expenditure survey. Using the results of the demand system estimations we calculate COLIs and compare them with superlative index numbers and the Laspeyres price index. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{industrial}} policy of subsidizing physical capital investment has been utilized {{in many countries}} {{in order to encourage}} export growth and spread economic development to outlying areas. For Israel, we possess a unique time series-cross <b>section</b> <b>micro</b> data set that details investment and its associated subsidies by vintage {{at the level of the}} individual enterprise for 620 firms. These data provide the means by which an empirical analysis of the effects of the policy of subsidizing capital can be undertaken. We estimate that, for the years 1990 - 94, this policy has resulted in production inefficiencies ranging from 5 % for firms that receive the average level of subsidies to 15 % for heavily subsidized firms. We also document the fact that much of the subsidization appears not to have been necessary, in the sense that subsidized firms generally have earned higher rates of return on their total physical capital (included that portion which was subsidized) than firms that were not subsidized. ...|$|R

This article investigates the use of Spanish and English in a formal speech event, the religious ceremony performed in the Catholic mass, which is governed by prescribed rules of linguistic conduct, {{in order to examine}} the factors that constrain language alternation and choice. A quantitative analysis of six 60 -minute services was used to determine the frequency of the two languages, both overall and in ritual versus non-ritual talk, and establish an empirical basis for describing the markedness of the two languages (Myers-Scotton, 2000, 2002). Patterns of language alternation are examined both at the macro level of the mass, from section to section, and at the <b>micro</b> level, within <b>sections,</b> and languages choices are explained using the Rational Choice model described by Myers-Scotton and Bolonyai (2001). ...|$|R
