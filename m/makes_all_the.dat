When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can understand him better, and then reduces it to a week. He <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E

Privy Counsellors, Ambassadors and High Commissioners, senior civil servants, senior military officers, members of important committees and commissions, and other officials are selected, {{and in most cases}} may be removed, by the Prime Minister. The PM also formally advises the Sovereign on the appointment of Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England, but the PM's discretion is limited by the existence of the Crown Nominations Commission.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{decision in}} choice of cylinders {{is whether the}} entire gas supply for the dive is to be carried in one set, or is to be divided into more than one set for {{different parts of the}} dive.

A single cylinder puts the diver in a position of dependence on the buddy for alternative breathing gas {{in case of an emergency}} cutting off the main air supply, unless the option of a free ascent is acceptable.|$|E

Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying, [...] "It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent." [...] Jason Buchanan of Allmovie said, [...] "While it's hard to defend the director {{for some of the}} truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the introduction of}} the bikini in Paris, American [...] compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff-bottom variation. Though size <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference in a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By {{the end of the decade}} a vogue for strapless styles developed, wired or bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners. But, it was the halterneck bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure. So much so as bikini designs called [...] "Huba Huba" [...] and [...] "Revealation" [...] were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest.|$|E
500|$|In the yeshiva setting, {{students}} {{prepare for}} and review the shiur (lecture) with their chavrusas during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as sedarim. On average, a yeshiva student spends ten {{hours per day}} learning in chavrusa. Since having the right chavrusa <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch chavrusas eight or nine times {{in a class of}} 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides. If a chavrusa gets stuck on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a sho'el u'mashiv (literally, [...] "ask and answer", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during sedarim. In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the chavrusas.|$|E

So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or a glint in his eye to unloading a lewd spiel sans wit." ...|$|E
500|$|In Saint-Briac, {{during the}} summer, Kirill played golf {{and he and}} Victoria joined in picnics and excursions. [...] They {{were part of the}} social life of the community, going out to play bridge and {{organizing}} theatricals. [...] During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games. [...] However, it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris [...] "for the occasional fling". Victoria, who had devoted her life to Kirill, was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her, according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania. She kept up a façade for the sake of her children, including her teenage son Vladimir, but was unable to forgive Kirill's betrayal. Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild, Mechtilde of Leiningen, in February 1936. Family and friends arrived, but nothing could be done. When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come, to which Victoria haltingly replied, [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference." [...] However, she [...] "shuddered away from Kirill's touch," [...] wrote Marie. She died on 1 March 1936. Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death: [...] "The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination, a tragic end to a tragic life. She carried tragedy within her – she had tragic eyes – always – even as a little girl – but we loved her enormously, there was something mighty about her – she was our Conscience." ...|$|E

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's {{acting in}} the beginning of season four, calling him [...] "a genius in [...] role". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger worried [...] "the actor is so good and the character so popular that he's kept alive even though it <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> heroes look like idiots". Following [...] "Confirmed Dead", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen felt [...] "Isn't the whole business of Ben manipulating Locke with the promise of Island secrets getting just a little bit old?" [...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that [...] "The more I hate Ben, the more I realize that Michael Emerson is just a very fine actor doing his job". Don Williams of BuddyTV said [...] "consider my mind blown again", referring to the flashforward in [...] "The Economist" [...] where it is revealed that Sayid is working for Ben. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god". Chris Carabott from IGN found one of the best moments of [...] "Eggtown", was the power struggle between Locke and Ben, because [...] "Their scenes together are amongst the best in the series and the one that opens [...] "Eggtown" [...] is a perfect display of how well Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn work together. O'Quinn captures Locke's uncertainty perfectly in the opening scene and it's always fun to watch Ben prey on any weakness of character." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post wrote [...] "with those big ol' eyes of his, [...] could always say more with a lengthy stare than he could with twenty pages of dialogue.... once again, proved why he has become Losts star as well as its heart and soul.... an Emmy should belong to [...]" [...] Jennifer Godwin of E! wrote that [...] "no one has ever done better work humanizing a supervillain." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide puts Ben in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] in the top 20 moments of the week, stating [...] "Michael Emerson on Lost. It doesn't get better than that". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy describes Emerson's performance as [...] "fantastic", with [...] "many layers of intrigue and humanity". John Kubicek of BuddyTV also found his performance [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "he nailed it". Critic Kelly Woo, from TV Squad, placed him on second on her list of [...] "Seven new characters that worked", ranking just below Desmond Hume, also from Lost.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} the LCBL has no desire to get players drafted. The commissioner's office simply understands its rarity. Making {{everyone}} swing wood, just to accommodate the 9.7% that will play baseball at the next level, is painting with a broad stroke. For a player who rationally understands that he has hit his ceiling [...] that upon the completion of his senior year he will never play competitive baseball again [...] it <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sense in the world for him to swing a bat with collegiate specifications. [...] Forcing such a player to limit their power, and spend a summer using tools they will not operate back on campus, is misguided.
