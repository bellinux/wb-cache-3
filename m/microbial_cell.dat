50|$|The main {{substrates}} of digestion in the reticulorumen are non-structural carbohydrates (starch, sugar, and pectin), structural carbohydrates (hemicellulose and cellulose), and nitrogen-containing compounds (proteins, peptides, and amino acids). Both non-structural {{and structural}} carbohydrates are hydrolysed to monosaccharides or disaccharides by microbial enzymes. The resulting mono- and disaccharides are transported into the microbes. Once within <b>microbial</b> <b>cell</b> walls, the mono- and disaccharides may be assimilated into microbial biomass or fermented to {{volatile fatty acids}} (VFAs) acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, valerate and other branched-chain VFAs via glycolysis and other biochemical pathways to yield energy for the <b>microbial</b> <b>cell.</b> Most VFAs are absorbed across the reticulorumen wall, directly into the blood stream, and are used by the ruminant as substrates for energy production and biosynthesis.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} plate {{counting}} is {{to estimate the}} number of cells present based {{on their ability to}} give rise to colonies under specific conditions of nutrient medium, temperature and time. Theoretically, one viable cell can give rise to a colony through replication.

In addition, many bacteria grow in chains (e.g. Streptococcus) or clumps (e.g. Staphylococcus). Estimation of microbial numbers by CFU will, in most cases, undercount the number of living cells present in a sample for these reasons.
