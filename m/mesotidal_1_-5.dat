N. m. r. studies clearly establish immobilization of {{both ends of the}} molecule on binding {{in the case of the}} decane derivative, whereas in the lower homologs the dimethylamino group on the naphthalene ring is significantly more affected in the presence of enzyme. The probes are effective inhibitors of the enzyme with the decane derivative being two orders of magnitude more effective than its lower homologs. Based on the n. m. r., fluorescence and inhibition studies, a model for probe binding to the enzyme is advanced. It appears that the decane derivative binds with high affinity to the catalytic anionic site while the lower affinity site is assigned to a peripheral anionic site. The lower homologs probe only the peripheral site. A comparison of fluorescence, n. m. r. and inhibition studies with acetylcholinesterases from electric eel and bovine erythrocytes is presented...|$|R

A CaM antagonist, N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide (W- 7), inhibited blue light-dependent proton pumping, whereas its less active structural analog, N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide (W- 5), {{had little effect on}} the response. Other CaM antagonists, trifluoperazine, compound 48 / 80, prenylamine, and 3 -(2 -benzothiazolyl) - 4, 5 -dimethoxy-N-[3 -(4 -phenyl-piperidinyl) - propylbenzenesulfonamide inhibited the proton pumping. In accord with these results, light-induced stomatal opening in the epidermis of Commelina benghalensis ssp. was inhibited by ML- 9 and W- 7, but not by H- 7 and W- 5. Thus, it is concluded that CaM and Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent myosin light chain kinase are the components of the signal transduction process in blue light-dependent proton pumping in guard cells...|$|R

ML- 7 also reduced the phosphorylation of the 47 kDa subunit of the NADPH-oxidase system (p 47 -phox) and blocked translocation of this protein to the Triton X- 100 -insoluble fraction in stimulated cells. Interestingly, ML- 7 also inhibited O 2 - production in a cell-free system derived from neutrophils at concentrations {{similar to those that}} were effective in vivo. This cell-free system does not require ATP and is insensitive to all other inhibitors of protein kinases tested, including some highly effective against MLCK (i. e. staurosporine). Thus, the data suggest that ML- 7 does not block O 2 - release by inhibiting a protein kinase but instead may interact directly with a subunit of the oxidase. The binding site for ML- 7 may provide a valuable target for inhibiting the inflammatory properties of phagocytic leucocytes by naphthalenesulphonamides designed to lack activity against protein kinases...|$|R
