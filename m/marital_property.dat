25|$|In Islam, {{there is}} no coverture, an idea central in European, American {{as well as in}} non-Islamic Asian common law, and the legal basis for the {{principle}} of <b>marital</b> <b>property.</b> An Islamic marriage is a contract {{between a man and a}} woman. A Muslim man and woman do not merge their legal identity upon marriage, and do not have rights over any shared <b>marital</b> <b>property.</b> The assets of the man before the marriage, and earned by him after the marriage, remain his during marriage and in case of a divorce. A divorce under Islamic law does not require redistribution of property. Rather, each spouse walks away from the marriage with his or her individual property. Divorcing Muslim women who did not work outside their home after marriage do not have a claim on the collective wealth of the couple under Islamic law, except for deferred mahr – an amount of money or property the man agrees to pay her before the woman signs the marriage contract.|$|E

While polygamy had become nearly nonexistent, she noted, one out of every ten marriages still involved a minor as of 2007, and the system was facing organizational challenges. Some reports claim that marriage of underage girls has actually risen since the passing of the reforms, and point out that the actual existence of separate <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> contracts remains low, despite their being newly legalized, meaning that the reforms offer little actual protection to women whose husbands order them to leave the marital home.|$|E

40|$|This {{study conducts}} a gender {{analysis}} of homeownership in Ecuador, drawing upon data collected through the nationally-representative 2010 Ecuador Household Asset Survey {{carried out by}} the authors. The survey collected data on asset ownership both at the household and individual levels. This allows us to overcome a typical problem faced by gender analyses, that of only having the sex of the household head and not the sex of the owner(s). The study explores gender differences in homeownership and housing wealth. There is fairly equal distribution of homeownership and housing wealth, which is not all that surprising given the partial community <b>property</b> <b>marital</b> regime. Any <b>property</b> purchased during marriage or while in a consensual union is considered joint property, unless it is inherited, in which case it is considered individually-owned property. This plus the fact that housing is an asset typically acquired during marriage/consensual union may help explain the relatively egalitarian distribution pattern of housing ownership and housing wealth. There are, however, gender differences in the determinants of homeownership and housing wealth. Past migration is associated with women owning homes and owning more housing wealth but does not seem to impact men’s homeownership or housing wealth. An extra year of schooling increases men’s housing wealth more than women’s housing wealth and women living in the coastal region own less housing wealth than men in the region. homeownership, gender, marital regime, partial community property rights, Ecuador, International Development,...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "women's movement" [...] {{began in}} 1848, most famously {{articulated}} by Elizabeth Stanton and Susan B.

However, {{by the end of the}} century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements. These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a [...] "crisis of masculinity" [...] in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist. The men who believed in this model cited religious models and natural law to emphasize women's need to return to the private sphere, in order to separate men and women to keep women from outwardly challenging men in public.|$|R

40|$|The {{divorce rate}} in the United States is {{slightly}} more than one-half the marriage rate. Divorce {{is a fact of}} life in this country, and will likely be so for the foreseeable future. On August 23, 1984, the divorce lawyer’s job got more complicated when Congress created the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (2 ̆ 2 QDRO 2 ̆ 2) as part of some significant amendments to ERISA. QDROs are necessary because before those 1984 ERISA amendments, a lot of divorced persons discovered that they could be deprived of their <b>marital</b> or community <b>property</b> interest in their former spouses 2 ̆ 7 retirement plans. For most divorcing couples, the two largest assets of the marriage are the marital home and retirement accounts. Over ninety-nine million persons participate in private sector retirement plans, and those plans 2 ̆ 7 assets total more than 4 trillion, which exceeds the total value of all residential real estate in the United States. Dividing retirement accounts is not as simple as a court decreeing that each party gets one-half of the other party 2 ̆ 7 s account. It takes a properly drafted QDRO to make sure each party gets his or her <b>marital</b> or community <b>property</b> share of the other 2 ̆ 7 s retirement benefits. Drafting a QDRO can be time consuming, complex, and frustrating in part because it requires lawyers who primarily practice state law to have a working knowledge of parts of the notoriously lengthy and complex ERISA. A substantial number – perhaps a majority – of QDROs are not prepared properly because they do not reflect the parties 2 ̆ 7 understanding of what they were awarded in the divorce proceeding. In fact, a former administrator for a retirement plan stated that between fifteen and twenty percent of the time, lawyers fail to see a QDRO through to completion. This article will detail the history leading to the creation of QDROs, explain what QDROs are, and offer suggestions on what pitfalls to look for and avoid in drafting them...|$|R
