It commits its parties to work toward the {{granting}} of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to the Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories and individuals, including labour rights {{and the right to}} health, the right to education, and the right to an adequate standard of living. As of 2015, the Covenant has 164 parties. A further six countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.|$|E

In this article, we study states’ commitment to 76 <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> concluded between 1990 and 2005. The article offers a systematic account of present-day multilateral treaty-making efforts and asks what explains variation in states’ participation as witnessed in the act of treaty ratification. We test existing explanations and provide a novel argument that accounts for the strong participation of new European democracies in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties.</b> We find that regime type and being part of the European Union (EU) strongly affect treaty ratification. New EU democracies, in particular, {{are much more likely to}} ratify <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> than are other new democracies...|$|R

2500|$|There {{were several}} {{bilateral}} treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> of Final Act of the Congress of Vienna (1815) that used wording expressing {{condemnation of the}} slave trade using moral language. For example, the Treaty of Paris (1814) between Britain and France included the wording [...] "principles of natural justice"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the Treaty of Ghent (1814) that the slave trade violated the [...] "principles of humanity and justice".|$|E
2500|$|A {{bilateral}} treaty (between two nations) or a <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> (among {{more than two}} nations, or organised by an International body) can {{be a source of}} Australian law. Australia has entered into a substantial number of treaties. [...] Although treaties can legally be entered into by the executive government of the day (not necessarily Parliament), in practice treaties are tabled in both houses of Parliament 15 days prior to signing. They are generally organised and administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who advise [...] "The general position under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined, apart from those terminating a state of war, are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. Signature and ratification do not, of themselves, make treaties operate domestically. In the absence of legislation, treaties cannot impose obligations on individuals nor create rights in domestic law. Nevertheless, international law, including treaty law, is a legitimate and important influence {{on the development of the}} common law and may be used in the interpretation of statutes." [...] Treaties can be implemented through executive action, and often existing laws are sufficient to ensure a treaty is honoured.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> regime on a provisional basis.|$|E

40|$|Who {{supports}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> and who doesn’t? We offer {{a systematic}} account of treaty ratification patterns paying {{particular attention to}} different states’ roles in international legal cooperation {{in relation to the}} United States’ ratification behavior. We argue that states’ ability to influence the terms of treaties and their acceptance increases their incentives for <b>treaty</b> ratification. <b>Multilateral</b> powers – states which are powerful and independent from the US – support multilateral legal cooperation because this offers them an opportunity to shape treaty content. Their engagement in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> is strongest when the United States does not lead. Other states that are weak and/or dependent cannot greatly affect treaties and are therefore less supportive of them but are subject to US pressure. An empirical analysis of states’ decisions to ratify prominent postwar <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> covering a wide range of global issues supports our argument. We conclude with broader implications for future international cooperation...|$|R

This article offers a novel explanation as to why new EU democracies participate in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties.</b> We argue that ratifying a treaty serves three external signaling purposes (addressing recognition concerns; increasing strategic autonomy, and pleasing the EU). We test our argument through a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. First, we apply event history analysis. Drawing on a new ratification data set comprising 76 <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties,</b> we illustrate the prominent role of new EU democracies in multilateralism as compared to other new democracies. Second, to assess the importance of external signaling {{in the decision to}} ratify <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties,</b> we examine parliamentary ratification debates in selected Central and Eastern European countries. Third, we compare parliamentary discussions across European and non-European new democracies to demonstrate the different motives driving their approaches toward multilateralism...|$|R
