2500|$|The Esprit was {{launched}} in October 1975 at the Paris Motor Show and entered production in June 1976, replacing the Europa in the Lotus model lineup. [...] These first cars became known as [...] "Series 1" [...] (or S1) Esprits. The wedge-shaped fibreglass body was mounted on a steel backbone chassis. Power was from the [...] Lotus 907 4-cylinder engine that produced [...] in European trim and [...] in US/Federal trim. The engine was mounted longitudinally behind the passengers and drove the rear wheels through a Citroën C35 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> also used in the SM and Maserati Merak. Rear brakes were mounted inboard, following contemporary racing practice. The Series 1 embodied Lotus' performance through light weight mantra, weighing less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{itself was}} Coventry Climax's FPF straight-4, {{in a variety}} of sizes. Initially the cars were fitted with the 2-litre powerplant, but as Climax {{gradually}} stretched the FPF's capacity the Lotus 16 appeared with a 2.2, then finally a 2.5-litre, full Formula One engine specification. As in the 12, the engine's power was transmitted to the road through the rear wheels, via Lotus's own 5-speed sequential <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> In its earliest incarnations this transaxle — designed by Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy incorporating a ZF limited slip differential — proved troublesome and gained itself the derogatorily punning nickname [...] "queerbox". However, in 1957 Chapman had hired Keith Duckworth (later to find fame as one half of the founders of Cosworth, and father of the Cosworth DFV) as a gearbox engineer who made significant improvements to its design. By the time that the Lotus unit found its way into the 16 it was a more reliable and less troublesome system.|$|E
2500|$|Although sales {{literature}} listed only two models available in 1984, {{there were at}} least three models available with different option packages. There was the Fiero Coupe, the Sport Coupe and the SE. The Fiero Coupe, also called [...] "Fuel Economy Leader", came with the MY-8 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> that had a 0.73 overdrive top gear along with a high mpg 3.32:1 axel ratio. This gave it an EPA highway/city rating of 50/31 mpg. Air conditioning and automatic transaxle could not be ordered. The starting price for the Fiero Coupe was $7999. The Fiero Sport Coupe, also referred to as the [...] "base car", came with the M-19 four-speed manual with a 0.81 top gear along with 4.10:1 differential, giving it better acceleration at the cost of fuel economy, 42/26 mpg. An automatic 3-speed transmission, MD-9 Hydramatic 125-C, was available along with A/C. The starting price was $8499 for the Sport Coupe. The top model was the Fiero SE, starting at $9599, it included the WS-6 handling package along with other trim upgrades.|$|E

50|$|The P538 or P538S was a rear {{mid-engined}} {{race car}} launched in late 1965 or early 1966 by Scuderia Bizzarrini of Livorno, Italy. At least two P538s were built with Chevrolet Corvette 327-cu.in. V-8s, {{and two more}} with 4.0- and 3.5-liter Lamborghini V12 engines. Five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxles</b> were used, with gearing specific to the race for which each car was constructed. Braking was via inboard four wheel disc brakes, with a fully independent suspension. The body was made of fiberglass over a tubular steel chassis.|$|R
50|$|The XJ13 had mid-engine format {{with the}} 5.0 litre V12 engine mounted behind the driver, {{used as a}} {{stressed}} chassis member together with the five-speed <b>manual</b> ZF <b>Transaxle</b> driving the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|This {{partnership}} with Ford began due to Mazda's financial difficulties during the 1960s. Starting in 1979 with a 7-percent financial stake, Ford expanded an existing {{partnership with}} Mazda {{resulting in various}} joint projects. The cooperation had begun in 1971 when the Mazda B-Series spawned a Ford Courier variant for North America, a version which was later offered in other markets as well. Mazda's Bongo and Titan cab-over trucks were sold with Ford badging in mainly Asia and the Pacific region beginning in 1976. These included large and small efforts {{in all areas of}} the automotive landscape [...] - [...] most notably in the realm of pickup trucks and smaller cars. Mazda began supplying <b>manual</b> <b>transaxles</b> to Ford in the spring of 1980. Mazda's Familia platform was used for Ford models like the Laser and Escort beginning in 1980, while the Capella architecture found its way into Ford's Telstar sedan and Probe sports models.|$|R

50|$|Ferrari {{commissioned}} FFD-Ricardo in the US {{to develop}} an automatic version of the 456GT four-seater coupé, preserving the V12’s famous driving experience but offering ease of use. Ricardo configured a four-speed torque converter transmission from scratch, using bought-in internal components and with a novel layout dictated by the six-speed <b>manual</b> Ferrari’s rear <b>transaxle</b> gearbox architecture. The propeller shaft from the front-mounted V12 drove the torque converter mounted ahead of the rear axle line, while the gearbox was positioned behind and fed its output forward to the differential.|$|R
50|$|The GM MR6/F40 {{six-speed}} <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> {{was first}} developed for Fiat, and use after by OPEL and Saab applications. Originally a design developed for Fiat, Opel and Saab applications, the F40 (MT2) is a GM Powertrain - Europe six-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> built by Opel in Rüsselsheim am Main, Germany.

5000|$|The first {{competition}} version, called {{either the}} Monza or Rally, {{also had a}} 750 cc engine but came with a 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> The highest performance version was called the Sebring, and it came with an 850 cc engine and a 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> A 5-speed transaxle was an option. Engines in the Monza/Rally and Sebring models were tuned by Autobleu and received Solex 32mm carburetors, performance camshafts, larger valves and new valve springs, modified cylinder heads and custom exhaust systems. These changes raised power output for the 750 to [...] {{and as much as}} [...] for the 850. The competition cars were slightly heavier than the standard cars.|$|E
5000|$|The MTX-II was a 4 speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> {{introduced}} in the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx as a base model [...] "fuel saver" [...] design. The Tempo and Topaz also used this as a base model. It was succeeded by the MTX-III.|$|E
50|$|Early {{units used}} a Chrysler 225ci {{industrial}} slant-6 engine. In 1969 a V-8 engine was introduced, using a Ford 302ci engine but still using the 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> In 1971, the Oldsmobile Toronado front wheel transaxle with a 455ci engine {{in conjunction with}} a GM 3-speed automatic was used.|$|E
5000|$|The only engine {{offered at}} {{first was the}} [...] "Poissy engine" [...] from Simca's 1100 Ti model. In the Bagheera this ohv straight-4 engine {{developed}} [...] @ 6000 rpm, two more horsepower than in the 1100 Ti. The transversely mounted engine was paired with the 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> from the 1100.|$|E

50|$|The F35 is a Saab-designed {{five-speed}} <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> {{built in}} Saab’s Gothenburg, Sweden, powertrain plant. This extensively tested manual transmission was originally {{introduced in the}} 1984 Saab 9000, and today it {{is used in the}} Saab 9-3 and 9-5, Saturn Ion Redline, Chevrolet Cobalt SS, Chevrolet HHR SS and various GM/Opel transverse engine front-wheel drive applications.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] 1.9 L CFI {{engine of}} the late 1980s, {{particularly}} when equipped with either the four- or five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle,</b> was notable for delivering outstanding fuel economy. Somewhat surprisingly, four-speed Escort Pony models achieved better mileage than five-speed cars, with upwards of 30 mpg in city driving and 40-45 mpg on the highway not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|The Dynavia {{was built}} on the Dyna X chassis. Power came from Panhard's {{two-cylinder}} OHV GM600 boxer engine with a bore of 72mm, a stroke of 75mm and total displacement of 610cc. The engine was front-mounted and drove the front wheels through a four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> Suspension was independent on all four corners. Steering was by rack-and-pinion. Brakes were drums front and rear.|$|E
50|$|The Ford {{flathead}} V8 {{drove the}} rear wheels via a custom Stout-built three-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle.</b> The engine was reversed from its normal position, mounted directly over the rear axle and with the flywheel and clutch facing forwards. The transmission was mounted ahead of this, reversing and lowering the driveline back to the axle. This unusual layout would later be repeated by the Lamborghini Countach.|$|E
50|$|Optional from 1991 to 1993 was a Getrag 284 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle,</b> {{which was}} also {{exclusive}} to the GM W platform and was available only with the LQ1; parts for the Getrag 284 are not available. The electronically controlled Hydramatic 4T60-E 4-speed automatic transaxle was the alternative, used during the entire production run {{with the exception of}} the 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 and 1997 Lumina LTZ, which received the 4T65-E.|$|E
5000|$|The Syracuse New Process Gear plant {{produced}} transfer {{cases for}} all of the [...] "Big Three" [...] Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.

5000|$|The Sera weighed {{less than}} 600 kg and was {{designed}} around a backbone chassis with a power-train and running gear sourced from Panhard. The engine was a two-cylinder boxer twin {{that could be}} had in [...] standard or [...] "Tigre" [...] versions, with the latter able to propel the car up to {{a top speed of}} 160 kph mph. The engine drove the front-wheels through a 4-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> from the Panhard Dyna Z.|$|E
5000|$|The Super Shift {{transmission}}, also {{marketed as}} Twin-Stick, was a <b>manual</b> <b>transaxle</b> transmission developed by Mitsubishi Motors {{in the late}} 1970s and used in {{a limited number of}} the company's road cars, most of which were manufactured in the 1980s. It was unusual in that it had 8 forward speeds in a 4x2 arrangement. It essentially installed a [...] "married" [...] overdrive unit to its manual transmission, something rare in a production vehicle of this type.|$|E
