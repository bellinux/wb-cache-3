However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats in December 1751. The Oratory included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and [...] "miscellany" [...] acts. The Oratory was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752. However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as [...] "the lowest buffoonery in the world even to <b>me</b> <b>who</b> <b>am</b> used to my uncle Horace." [...] Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as Poems on Several Occasions, {{which resulted in the}} end of the Oratory and The Midwife.|$|E
