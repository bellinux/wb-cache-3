However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.

25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as <b>microwave</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states (electron paramagnetic resonance), molecular rotations, molecular vibration and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions; rotational spectroscopy and <b>microwave</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as fluorescence spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. Molecules {{containing}} argon can be van der Waals molecules held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study stretching and bending movements, <b>microwave</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. Mass spectroscopy is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of in silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment. This article is mostly based on experimental or observational results.|$|E

This sensor uses a microfluidic network in order to guide the liquid and drive the particles to analyze. Once properly calibrated this sensor should allow measuring the intrinsic dielectric properties of unknown liquid medium and even individual characteristics of flowing particles. Indeed characterizations done on small volumes of liquids with this device showed a good agreement with macro scale measurements done using a coaxial probe. To demonstrate its sensing capabilities, experiments with polystyrene beads have been first performed and compared with 3 D electromagnetic simulations which show that potential high detection sensitivity can be expected.

2500|$|Curl's {{research}} at Rice involved {{the fields of}} infrared and <b>microwave</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> [...] Curl's research inspired Richard Smalley to come to Rice in 1976 {{with the intention of}} collaborating with Curl. [...] In 1985, Curl was contacted by Harold Kroto, who wanted to use a laser beam apparatus built by Smalley to simulate and study the formation of carbon chains in red giant stars. Smalley and Curl had previously used this apparatus to study semiconductors such as silicon and germanium. They were initially reluctant to interrupt their experiments on these semiconductor materials to use their apparatus for Kroto's experiments on carbon, but eventually gave in.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the monitoring of single cells subjected to electroporation using <b>microwave</b> dielectric <b>spectroscopy.</b> The experimental results showed first {{a clear distinction}} between two cell states: viable cells and affected ones by a chemical treatment (Saponin). It also pointed out a high correlation (R 2 > 0. 94) with biological standard techniques in detecting the two types of electroporation: the reversible and irreversible ones. The developed microfluidic and microwave-based sensor exposes a decrease in the capacitive and conductive contrasts of the investigated single cells treated by irreversible electroporation indicating damages at the cellular level, while cells under reversible electroporation present a similar dielectric response to that of the nontreated cells. This result corresponds to results frequently employed in biological studies. More interestingly, a study of the kinetics of the cell's damage induction over time, by electroporation, has been experimentally done, which makes <b>microwave</b> dielectric <b>spectroscopy</b> an attractive technique for cell's electroporation researches...|$|R
