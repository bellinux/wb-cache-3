We compare the measures extracted from call detail records and airtime credit purchases to the results of a nationwide household survey conducted at the same time. Results show high correlations (>. 8) between <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> derived indicators and several relevant food security variables such as expenditure on food or vegetable consumption.

30|$|Following {{the above}} considerations, it is {{reasonable}} to argue that <b>mobile</b> phones <b>data</b> {{could be used as a}} proxy to measure the diversity of the resident population living in the city without having to resort to census data. It is clear, however, that <b>mobile</b> phones <b>data</b> accounts also for individuals who are not permanent residents and, therefore, cannot be tracked by census. Furthermore, the estimation of the population diversity using <b>mobile</b> phones <b>data</b> will be biased by different usage patterns between different demographic groups [31].|$|R
40|$|Novel {{digital data}} sources {{allow us to}} attain {{enhanced}} knowledge about locations and mobilities of people in space and time. Already a fast-growing body of literature demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of <b>mobile</b> phone-based <b>data</b> in social sciences for considering mobile devices as proxies for people. However, the implementation of such data imposes many theoretical and methodological challenges. One major issue is the uneven spatial resolution of <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> due to the spatial configuration of mobile network base stations and its spatial interpolation. To date, different interpolation techniques are applied to transform <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> into other spatial divisions. However, these do not consider the temporality and societal context that shapes the human presence and mobility in space and time. The paper aims, first, to contribute to mobile phone-based research by addressing the need to give {{more attention to the}} spatial interpolation of given data, and further by proposing a dasymetric interpolation approach to enhance the spatial accuracy of <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data.</b> Second, it contributes to population modelling research by combining spatial, temporal and volumetric dasymetric mapping and integrating it with <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data.</b> In doing so, the paper presents a generic conceptual framework of a multi-temporal function-based dasymetric (MFD) interpolation method for <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data.</b> Empirical results demonstrate how the proposed interpolation method can improve the spatial accuracy of both night-time and daytime population distributions derived from different <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> sets by taking advantage of ancillary data sources. The proposed interpolation method can be applied for both location- and person-based research, and is a fruitful starting point for improving the spatial interpolation methods for <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data.</b> We share the implementation of our method in GitHub as open access Python code...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{patterns}} of human aggregation {{are thought to}} drive annual and multiannual outbreaks of infectious diseases, but the paucity of data about travel behavior and population flux over time has made this idea difficult to test quantitatively. Current measures of human mobility, especially in low-income settings, are often static, relying on approximate travel times, road networks, or cross-sectional surveys. <b>Mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> provide a unique {{source of information about}} human travel, but the power of these data to describe epidemiologically relevant changes in population density remains unclear. Here we quantify seasonal travel patterns using <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> from nearly 15 million anonymous subscribers in Kenya. Using a rich data source of rubella incidence, we show that {{patterns of}} population travel (fluxes) inferred from <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> are predictive of disease transmission and improve significantly on standard school term time and weather covariates. Further, combining seasonal and spatial data on travel from <b>mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> allows us to characterize seasonal fluctuations in risk across Kenya and produce dynamic importation risk maps for rubella. <b>Mobile</b> phone <b>data</b> therefore offer a valuable previously unidentified source of data for measuring key drivers of seasonal epidemics...|$|R
