Unimproved swards include meadows dominated meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum), meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum) and similar species, and southern marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza praetermissa). In the wetter areas rushes and marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) are found. Catcott Heath is noted for its rare vascular plants including <b>marsh</b> <b>pea</b> (Lathyrus palustris), milk-parsley (Peucedanum palustre) and marsh fern (Thelypteris palustris). A total of 127 aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded in the field ditches, internal drainage board maintained rhynes and deep arterial watercourses.|$|E
5000|$|The site is {{composed}} of former grazing marshlands reclaimed from salt marshes in the 18th century and now reverted to waterlogged pasture. The site is notable, according to the SSSI citation, for its biological features which include [...] "an extensive reedbed and associated communities, {{the presence of the}} rare <b>marsh</b> <b>pea,</b> (Lathyrus palustris), the fen land invertebrate community, and the presence of a strong breeding population of Cetti's warblers (Cettia cetti)". The reed bed {{is one of the largest}} in Carmarthanshire, and supports reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniculus) and water rail (Rallus aquaticus). Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris) visit in winter.|$|E
5000|$|Wicken Fen {{is divided}} by a {{man-made}} watercourse called [...] "Wicken Lode".

The designated national nature reserve of 269 hectares also includes {{the area around the}} Mere, to the south of Wicken Lode. These areas contain original peat fen with communities of carr and sedge. They support rare and uncommon fenland plants such as <b>marsh</b> <b>pea,</b> Cambridge milk parsley, fen violet and marsh fern. This part of the Fen can be enjoyed from a series of boardwalks (made from recycled plastic).|$|E
