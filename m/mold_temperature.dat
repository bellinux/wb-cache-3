50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short mold life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the mold life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the mold life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The mold life is dependent on four factors: the mold material, the pouring temperature, the <b>mold</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the mold configuration. Molds made from gray cast iron can be more economical to produce but have short mold lives. On the other hand, molds made from H13 tool steel may have a mold life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the mold life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> is too low misruns are produced, but if the <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and mold erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the mold or casting can decrease mold life as well.|$|E

After washing, the foam form is introduced into the vulcanizer stage to complete the cross-linking process. The final step is the drying process where residual moisture is driven off.|$|E

50|$|Induction heating is used {{in plastic}} {{injection}} molding machines. Induction heating improves energy efficiency for injection and extrusion processes. Heat is directly generated in {{the barrel of the}} machine, reducing warm-up time and energy consumption. The induction coil can be placed outside thermal insulation, so it operates at low temperature and has a long life. The frequency used ranges from 30 kHz down to 5 kHz, decreasing for thicker barrels. The reduction in cost of inverter equipment has made induction heating increasingly popular. Induction heating can also be applied to molds, offering more even <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> and improved product quality.|$|E
50|$|Injection molding is a {{traditional}} cost effective method for manufacturing of short fiber thermoplastics. The processing conditions such as <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure as well as filling time, the part geometry, position and number of injection gates are main factors influencing distribution of fibers. As a result, depending on the total thickness of the manufactured parts {{as well as the}} distance from mold wall, different fiber orientation distributions can be observed. In a thin layer in mid-thickness fiber orientations are preferably perpendicular to the mold flow direction, while in two near wall thicknesses fibers are preferably in line with the mold flow direction.|$|E

Fiber {{content of a}} transfer molded composite can {{be as high as}} 60% by volume. The fill material may be a preheated solid or a liquid. It is loaded into a chamber known as the pot. A ram or plunger forces material from the pot into the heated mold cavity. If feed-stock is initially solid, the forcing pressure and <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> melt it. Standard mold features such as sprue channels, a flow gate and ejector pins may be used. The heated mold ensures that the flow remains liquid for complete filling. Once filled the mold can be cooled at a controlled rate for optimal thermoset curing.|$|E

The materials were semicrystalline, containing B-type, Vh-type, and Eh-type crystallinity. The properties were dependent on water content.

50|$|The {{stages of}} {{heating and cooling}} involve {{transfer}} of heat first from the hot medium to the polymer material and next from it to the cooling environment. In both cases, the process of heat transfer occurs in an unsteady regime; therefore, its kinetics attracts the greatest interest in considering these steps. In the heating stage, the heat taken from the hot gas is absorbed both by the mold and the polymer material. The rig for rotational molding usually has a relatively small wall thickness and is manufactured from metals with a high thermal conductivity (aluminum, steel). As a rule, the mold transfers much more heat than plastic can absorb; therefore, the <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> must vary linearly. The rotational velocity in rotational molding is rather low (4 to 20 rpm). As a result, in the first stages of the heating cycle, the charged material remains as a powder layer {{at the bottom of}} the mold.

The raw material, consisting of bamboo powder and pure water were put into the reactor and sealed tightly. To decompose the raw material, the temperature of reactor was elevated by the ring furnace to a specified level and maintained for 10 min. For investigate the ability of the decomposed bamboo powder to be molded without the use of a binder, the compression molding technique was employed. The mechanical characteristics of fabricated composites were measured under four point bending load. The Young’s modulus of fabricated composites was also measured by using dynamic hardness tester. The change in amount of holocellulose, α-cellulose, and lignin during molding was quantitatively evaluated by using the milled composite. Test results showed that the bending strength was increased with increase of <b>temperature</b> of <b>molding.</b> Fracture surface observation revealed that when <b>molding</b> <b>temperature</b> was high, fine surface was appeared at fractured surface, while rough surface was appeared when <b>molding</b> <b>temperature</b> was low.

Due to the several improvements such as the injection pressure reduction, the increasing on molded parts quality and the possibility to control the <b>mold</b> <b>temperature,</b> this technology is becoming an interesting solution for injection molding of thin wall components with engineering polymers. The elevated <b>mold</b> <b>temperature,</b> however, substantially increases the cycle time, thus lowering the productivity to a great extent. Development of capable techniques for rapidly heating and cooling a mold with a relatively large mass is technically challenging because of the constraints set by the injection molding process. In this work a porous mold insert with a regular deterministic geometry was developed and optimized through a numerical simulations to increase heat exchange between water and the cavity surface. An accurate mold numerical model was developed and experimentally validated. The results showed a substantial increase of the global coefﬁcient of thermal conduction compared to the existing technologies for the rapid variation of the mold cavity temperature. A further experimental study {{was focused on the}} RHCM inﬂuence on microstructure and mechanical properties of long glass fibre reinforced polypropylene. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was employed to allow a direct observation of the fibres orientation and image analysis was used to measure the residual ﬁbres length distribution. Tensile strength and fatigue analysis were performed in order to characterize the injection molded specimens, with a CIM and RHCM technologies, from static and dynamic point of view. The using of an high <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> resulted in a lower ﬁbre orientation while the residual ﬁbre length was enhanced.

The paper {{deals with}} the {{dependence}} of <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> on its cavity filling time {{for the production of}} lightweight profile applying the technology of extrusion into a mold. The introductory part is a brief theoretical analysis of the extrusion technology, viscosity of the melt and the nature of mold tempering. The following parts of this paper deal with the methodology of carrying out of experiments, analysis of the mold cavity filling process and determination of the dependence of <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> on its cavity filling time, which have been obtained based on a computer simulation and from a real manufacturing process...|$|E

The casting`s sensitivity to changes in these process steps was experimentally determined Dimensional and radiographic inspection were used to judge {{the sensitivity of the}} casting. Thirty-six castings of different pedigrees were poured and measured. Some of the dimensional inspection was conducted during the processing. It was confirmed that wax fixturing, number of gates, gate location, pour and <b>mold</b> <b>temperature,</b> pour speed, and cooling profile all affected the radiographic quality of the casting. Gate and runner assembly techniques, number of gates, and <b>mold</b> <b>temperature</b> affect the dimensional quality of the casting...|$|E
40|$|Within this {{research}} {{the effect of}} injection <b>molding</b> <b>temperature</b> on polypropylene (PP) /poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) blends and microfibrillar composites was investigated. Injection molding blends (IMBs) and microfibrillar composites (MFCs) of PP/PET have been prepared in a weight ratio 70 / 30. The samples were processed at three different injection <b>molding</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Tim) (210, 230, 280 °C) and subjected to extensive characterization. The observations from the fracture surfaces of MFCs showed that PET fibers {{can be achieved by}} three step processing. The results indicated that Tim has a big influence on morphology of IMBs and MFCs. With increasing the Tim, distinctive variations in particle and fiber diameters were noticed. The differences in mechanical performances were obtained by flexural and impact tests. Establishing relationships between the processing parameters, properties, and morphology of composites is of key importance for the valorization of MFC polymers...|$|R
