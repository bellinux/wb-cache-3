5|$|Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another {{powerful}} {{city in the}} Petén Basin. Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive {{systems of}} allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations {{with other members of}} the same network. Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the <b>manoeuvering</b> of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.|$|E
5|$|A Company was not {{significantly}} delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by <b>manoeuvering</b> through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Laforey {{immediately}} advanced on {{the strange}} sails, which were soon {{revealed to be}} Castor and the Dutch merchant ship. With Carysfort bearing down on him L'Huillier cast off the tow and prepared for battle, meeting the approaching British frigate with a broadside. The engagement was fought at close range and with little <b>manoeuvering</b> by either side, the ships exchanging broadsides {{for an hour and}} fifteen minutes before L'Huillier surrendered. His ship was heavily battered in the exchange, with the main topgallantmast knocked down and the mainmast and hull severely damaged. Carysfort suffered just one man killed and four wounded from the understrength crew of 180, while casualties were much heavier among the approximately 200 men aboard Castor, the French losing 16 men killed and nine wounded. The Dutch ship initially escaped, but was later captured and its value was eventually included in the prize money paid for Castor.|$|E

40|$|Understanding drivers’ {{responses}} to critical events, analyzing drivers’ abilities to perform corrective <b>manoeuvers,</b> and investigating {{the correlation between}} these <b>manoeuvers</b> and crash severity provide the opportunity of increasing the knowledge about how to avoid crash occurrence or at least mitigate crash severity. We extend existing research on the determinants of engaging in crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> by considering that observable and unobservable factors relate to both the selection of corrective <b>manoeuvers</b> and the severity outcome. Accordingly, we propose a joint multinomial-logit ordered-probit model of single-vehicle crashes extracted from the NASS GES database for the years 2005 – 2009. Results show (1) the existence of unobserved correlation between crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> and crash severity, and (2) the link between drivers’ attributes, risky driving behaviour, road characteristics, and environmental conditions, with the propensity to engage in crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> and experience severe crash outcomes...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{strategy of}} Heraclius, {{to destroy the}} Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale: by rapidly deploying and <b>manoeuvering</b> his forces, Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan {{was never able to}} make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the unfavorable terrain that prevented large-scale deployment. However, at no point did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six, his battle line remained remarkably static. This all stands {{in stark contrast to the}} very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final day, when he reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary <b>manoeuvering</b> (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E
5|$|The last bagler king Philip Simonsson died in 1217. Speedy {{political}} and military <b>manoeuvering</b> by Skule led to a reconciliation between the birkebeiner and bagler, and thus the reunification of the kingdom. However, some discontented elements among the bagler found a new royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung, and launched a new rising from 1219. The rising only gained support in parts of Eastern Norway, and were unable {{to gain control of}} Viken and Opplandene as the bagler formerly had done. In the summer of 1223 Skule eventually managed to force the Ribbungar to surrender. The great meeting in Bergen soon after however renewed the division of the Norwegian kingdom with Skule, who thereafter gained control of the northern third of the country instead of the east, in what marked a setback despite his military victory. In 1224, Ribbung who had been in Skule's custody escaped, and Haakon was left to fight him alone as the new ruler of Eastern Norway. Skule remained passive {{throughout the rest of the}} war, and his support for Haakon was lukewarm at best. Assuming the military lead in the fight, Haakon nevertheless defeated Ribbung through comprehensive and organisationally demanding warfare over the next years. As part of the campaign, Haakon additionally led a large army into Värmland, Sweden in 1225 in order to punish the inhabitants for their support of Ribbung. While Ribbung died in 1226, the revolt was finally quashed in 1227 after the surrender of the last leader of the uprising, Haakon the Crazy's son Knut Haakonsson. This left Haakon more or less uncontested monarch.|$|E
40|$|Competitive surfing {{is judged}} upon the {{performance}} of <b>manoeuvers</b> on the wave, and showing control, variety and complexity of <b>manoeuvers</b> will score high. The competitions are judged by several credentialed judges comprising a panel of 4 - 6 persons and each wave ridden is judged out of a maximum of 10 points. The best two waves in the heat make up the total score. Due to these rules, performance of surfing has many different aspects, which are both tactically and physically demanding, with the physical work having been described as intermittent in nature. The wave riding part of surfing consists of about 5 % of the total time spent surfing, hence requiring the athlete to perform maximal efforts when an opportunity is given. Choosing the right wave {{to be able to}} execute high-scoring <b>manoeuvers</b> {{is an important part of}} competitive surfing. Previously, it was mainly the length of the ride and number of <b>manoeuvers</b> that were considered to score well in competition, however, the judging criteria has formally changed recently, in order to encourage more complex and risk taking <b>manoeuvers.</b> Hence, nowadays the more advanced <b>manoeuvers</b> are scored higher in comparison to a higher amount of lower risk <b>manoeuvers.</b> Only recently, the execution of aerial <b>manoeuvers</b> has become frequent in competitions. Although they have been present in ‘free surfing’ for several years, the competitive level of the sport has progressed lately, and now aerial <b>manoeuvers</b> appear to be an important technical aspect for competitive success, and as such, potentially placing new demands on the surfing performance and physical characteristics of the athletes. The task involves several phases, such as speed generation, take-off, acrobatic air movements and landing. Landing tasks have previously been shown to increase the biomechanical load and risk of injury in other sports, suggesting that this might also be the case for surfing. If execution of aerial <b>manoeuvers</b> is crucial to high performance in competitive surfing, it follows that the athlete needs to have appropriate levels of skill and physical strength in order to perform well and avoid injury. However, it has not yet been researched whether the execution of aerial <b>manoeuvers</b> score better than performing more traditional <b>manoeuvers</b> in competition. This study has analyzed the wave scores from three WCT competitions in order to explore if there is a difference between the scores if an aerial is included in the selection of <b>manoeuvers.</b> Furthermore, we have compared the linear relationship between wave score and number of <b>manoeuvers</b> when one or more aerials are included, versus not included (non-aerial). The hypothesis was that waves containing one or more aerial <b>manoeuver</b> would score higher than non-aerial waves...|$|R
50|$|The {{selected}} test <b>manoeuvers</b> {{must be able}} {{to stimulate}} as many algorithms implemented in the software as possible. Cold start, overshoot of rounds per minute, and ECE cycle (a standard <b>manoeuver</b> used to calibrate on-board diagnosis) are relevant examples. In addition, the engine parameters selected to be monitored must represent the engine global operating state along the <b>manoeuvers</b> executed, such as accelerator pedal deflection, engine speed, vehicle speed, engine temperature, and throttle body opening percentage. It is also necessary to monitor the mean variables of the control chain of air and torque estimation. All these diagnostic variables must be kept under control during the execution of the <b>manoeuvers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Although T1 patrol {{spent about}} {{an hour on the}} airfield, none of the New Zealanders had been hit and none of their {{vehicles}} had been put out of action.
