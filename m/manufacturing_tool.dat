40|$|Lean Manufacturing {{has made}} a {{significant}} impact on both the academic and manufacturing circles in the last decade. Fostered by a rapid spread into many other industrial sectors beyond the automotive industry, there has been significant development and "localisation" of the Lean Manufacturing concept in both developed and developing countries worldwide. Despite its successful application {{in a wide range of}} industries, little research has been carried out on its successful application outside the traditional high-volume, or massproduction manufacturing environment. It has been found that there is a lack of relevant literature on the application in the high-variety manufacturing milieu. In this aspect, this research objective is to determine: 1) The implementation issues when applying Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques in high-variety manufacturing environment, and 2) Are there any challenges encountered in applying these Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques in the high-variety manufacturing environment. This research will focus on two plants, with different manufacturing scenes, one a high-volume mass-production plant and the other a high-variety manufacturing plant in implementing the Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques. This paper starts with the background and the key defining concept of Lean Manufacturing followed by a review of the various Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques available. This is followed by the identification of the issues and challenges encountered by the two manufacturing plants during the implementation. The research concludes by providing a framework for the successful implementation of Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques in a high-variety manufacturing environment and future research recommendations. A qualitative research method was adopted to analyse the data. An open-ended questionnaire was designed, and the findings incorporated into the semi-structured interviews with the Lean Champions and the Plant Managers. The shop floors of both manufacturing plants were visited and observed after the interviews had confirmed actual Lean Manufacturing implementations. A summary copy of the researcher’s findings was sent to the Lean Champions for verification before concluding this research. The research results indicate that there were many unique issues and challenges in applying Lean <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques in a high-variety manufacturing environment. Despite the many issues and challenges, Lean manufacturing can in fact be applied to high-variety manufacturing environment but with much difficulty. The implementation journey is without doubt challenging, but with perseverance and an enthusiastic leadership team, it can be successful...|$|R

50|$|While {{the use of}} iron {{started to}} become more {{widespread}} around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal {{for long periods of}} time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tool</b> steel until the early 1900s.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focused on increase of the efficiency of production processes in Czech companies, whose main work focus is electric motor production with usage of the lean <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> with the environmental management system. The main reason for choosing this topic were results of prime study of the target group of companies which has proved that companies do have trouble not just with integration but especially with implementation of the lean manufacturing methods. This {{is the reason why}} concrete conditions and basic principles need to be defined to show how to proceed. The objective of this dissertation thesis is to suggest the model of integration of lean <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> with optional environmental management tool and as the lean <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> were chosen methods of lean management in production and as an optional environmental tool was chosen system of environmental management based on norm ISO 14 001.

Based on knowledge from detailed research of Czech and foreign literary sources a survey and guided interview was started with companies, which are focused on electric motor production. The thesis contains a detailed evaluation of empirical research with testing of stated hypothesis, based on which the verbal model of the integration of the lean <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tools</b> with the environmental management system is assembled. The implantation based on the suggested verbal model of the integration in the company should lead not just to the relationship improvement between the company and the environment but also to better understanding of the relationship of two independent kinds of company management leading to saving money, working environment improvement, productivity increase or ecological onus decrease.
