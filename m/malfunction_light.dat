5000|$|The first Silver Age Doctor Light was a {{criminal}} physicist named Doctor Arthur Light, who first appeared in Justice League of America #12, where he succeeded in capturing the League with light rays after first drawing them in by capturing Aquaman, then sending the League to different planets based on their weaknesses. He sent Superman to a red sun world, and Aquaman to a waterless one using faster light that opened wormholes. He then ordered Snapper Carr to write this down, before imprisoning him in a light field. He had not realised Superman and Batman had impersonated each other after Batman had been concerned about how easily the villain had overcome the other members, allowing Superman to escape the world {{he was sent to}} and rescue the other members. However, Light nearly succeeded in taking over the world after fooling the League with three duplicates of himself that were apparently committing robberies of light-associated objects, though they were actually placing devices around the world. Green Lantern realized this trick and faked his death to track Doctor Light, finally stopping him before he pulled the lever that would have set off the light impulses allowing him to take over the world. A retcon introduced in Secret Origins #37 revealed that this character was actually the second Doctor Light. According to the retcon, his predecessor was his partner at S.T.A.R. Labs, a scientist named Jacob Finlay. Finlay created a technologically advanced suit to control light allowing him to be a minor superhero, but was accidentally killed by Arthur Light near the beginning of his heroic career (though Finlay's death may have been caused by hiding his costume in a computer console, causing it to <b>malfunction).</b> <b>Light</b> took the suit and the [...] "Doctor Light" [...] codename, using them for selfish, criminal ends. He has been periodically haunted by Finlay's ghost through the years, but could use the light generated by the suit to drive off this spirit.|$|E

50|$|White LEDs {{can also}} be made by coating near-ultraviolet (NUV) LEDs {{with a mixture of}} high-efficiency europium-based {{phosphors}} that emit red and blue, plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu, Al) that emits green. This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work. This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that UV light may leak from a <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>light</b> source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.|$|R

40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{on-board}} diagnostics II (OBD II) regulation requires all vehicle manufacturers to monitor virtually every emission-control component and {{system that can}} cause increases in emissions. When an emission-related malfunction is detected, the OBD II system alerts the vehicle owner by illuminating the <b>malfunction</b> indicator <b>light</b> (MIL) on the vehicle instrument panel. By alerting the owner of malfunctions as they occur, repairs can be sought promptly, which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle. Manufacturers began phase-in of the OBD II requirements in 1994, with full implementation required on all 1996 and newer model year vehicles. The Air Resources Board (ARB) last adopted modifications to the curren...|$|R

2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability.

Because the accuracy of the self-localization is closely related to the interval between emitters, the accuracy is affected by the failure {{of a large number of}} emitters. However, in our work, the emitters were installed on the ceiling as this method can be expected to minimize disturbance of the signals by obstacles. Emitters with different IDs are supported by independent microcontrollers and power, an arrangement designed to avoid the simultaneous failure of a large number of emitters. Therefore, in this experiment, we simulated the failure of two emitters.|$|R

40|$|The {{building}} {{sector of}} the United States currently consumes over 40 % of the United States primary energy supply. Estimates suggest that between 5 and 30 % of any building's annual energy consumption is unknowingly wasted due to pathologically <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>lighting</b> and comfort conditioning systems. This thesis is focused on developing analytical methods embodied within useful software tools to quickly identify and evaluate those building system faults that cause large building energy inefficiencies. The technical contributions of this work include expert rules that adapt to HVAC equipment scale and operation, a general framework for applying probabilistic inference to HVAC fault detection and evaluation, and methods for sorting fault signals according to userdefined interests such as annual cost of energy inefficiencies. These contributions are particularly unique in their treatment of model and measurement uncertainty within the fault inference, and the careful consideration of user interests in fault evaluation. As a first step to developing this general framework for fault detection, I targeted first order faults such as simultaneous heating and cooling and imbalanced air flows within several large air-handling units in three buildings on the MIT campus. Experiments included the purposeful implementation of mechanical and software control programming faults on otherwise fault-free equipment. Between the five pieces of equipment, the software system successfully identified all previously known and experimentally implemented faults, as well as additional faults {{that had not been}} previously identified or imposed during the experiment. User testing and experiments show that embracing uncertainty within HVAC fault detection and evaluation is not only paramount to judicious fault inference but it is also central to gaining the trust and buy-in of system users who ultimately can apply fault detection information to actually fix and improve building operations. by Stephen Samouhos.

Estimates suggest that between 5 and 30 % of any building's annual energy consumption is unknowingly wasted due to pathologically <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>lighting</b> and comfort conditioning systems. This paper presents analytical methods embodied within useful software tools to quickly identify and evaluate those building system faults that cause large building energy inefficiencies. The technical contributions of this work include expert rules that adapt to HVAC equipment scale and operation and methods for sorting fault signals according to user-defined interests such as annual cost of energy inefficiencies. These contributions are particularly unique in their treatment of model and the careful consideration of user interests in fault evaluation. As a first step to developing this general framework for fault detection, first order faults such as simultaneous heating and cooling and imbalanced airflows within several large air-handling units were targeted. Savings of around $ 22, 500 were predicted when the fault of simultaneous heating and cooling was occurring over the entire month in an air handler. Some of the other faults include the heat recovery pump operation in air handling units. An example of the potential energy savings in a large hospital that has been monitored is presented. Yearly savings of around $ 24, 000 were predicted by correcting {{the operation of the}} heat recovery pump. Faults in the cooling system were also explored. The paper presents a strategy to load multiple centrifugal chillers with a monotonically increasing COP vs. partload ratio curve. The paper also considers the optimization of cooling tower fan operation coupled with the chiller operation. Models for cooling tower performance and chiller performance are used to define the operation that yields the minimum energy consumption of the system. The number of cooling tower fans and the use of multiple towers with a single chiller are considered. The optimum operation is compared to actual operations to signal operating faults. User testing and experiments show that embracing uncertainty within HVAC fault detection and evaluation is not only paramount to judicious fault inference but it is also central to gaining the trust and buy-in of system users who ultimately can apply fault detection information to actually fix and improve building operations. by Suhrid Avinash Deshmukh.
