Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E

5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men sneak up on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the <b>matter,</b> <b>which</b> Robb declines.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but <b>matter</b> (<b>which</b> they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of <b>matter,</b> <b>which</b> states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic <b>matter,</b> <b>which</b> together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E

5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
5|$|A port of No One Lives Forever – Game of the Year Edition for the Mac OS X {{operating}} system {{was developed by}} MumboJumbo, and published by MacPlay. It was released on November 21, 2002, soon after the original Windows release of No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way (which was also ported to Mac OS X by MacPlay later). Similarly to the Windows version of the game, the Mac OS X port also uses GameSpy technology for its online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play with each other, no <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> platform they use.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through.

Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} of 2011, Mirela Holy, who had declared her opposition to the project prior to {{the elections}}, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection. In 2012 the ministry commissioned four reviews of the EIA. The reviews—one of them supporting the EIA and three disproving the conclusions of the original EIA—were submitted to the Government of Croatia one day after Holy resigned her post, reportedly over an unrelated matter, on 7 June 2012. Objections were raised by authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors have been kept secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the <b>matter,</b> <b>which</b> has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Leon {{travels to}} a nearby island {{research}} facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He soon discovers {{that one of his}} former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. It is eventually revealed that both Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon finally confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island self-destructs.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark <b>matter,</b> <b>which</b> has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No <b>matter</b> <b>which</b> character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
