5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC pebble mosaics of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{formation}} – Ligand SLiMs often {{function as}} simple interfaces that recruit proteins to multi-protein complexes (e.g. the Retinoblastoma-binding LxCxE <b>motif)</b> <b>or</b> act as aggregators in scaffold proteins (e.g. SH3 domain-binding proline-rich sequences).|$|E
25|$|Earth {{figures are}} large designs and motifs that are created {{on the stone}} ground surface. They can be {{classified}} through their method of manufacture. Intaglios are created by scraping away the desert pavements (pebbles covering the ground) to reveal a negative image on the bedrock below. The best known example of such intaglio rock art is the Nazca Lines of Peru. In contrast, geoglyphs are positive images, which are created by piling up rocks on the ground surface to resulting in a visible <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> design.|$|E

25|$|The clave rhythmic {{pattern is}} used as a tool for {{temporal}} organization in Afro-Cuban music, such as rumba, conga de comparsa, son, mambo (music), salsa, Latin jazz, songo and timba. The five-stroke clave pattern (distributed in groups of 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 beats) represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms. Just as a keystone holds an arch in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. The pattern is also found in the African diaspora musics of Haitian Vodou drumming and Afro-Brazilian music. The clave pattern is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> ostinato, or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.|$|E
25|$|The Khazar state was, Oppenheim says, {{the only}} Jewish state to rise between the Fall of the Second Temple (67–70 CE) and the {{establishment}} of Israel (1948), and its example stimulated messianic aspirations for a return to Israel as early as Judah Halevi. In the time of the Egyptian vizier Al-Afdal Shahanshah (d.1121), one Solomon ben Duji, often identified as a Khazarian Jew, attempted to advocate for a messianic effort for the liberation of, and return of all Jews to, Palestine. He wrote to many Jewish communities to enlist support. He eventually moved to Kurdistan where his son Menachem some decades later assumed the title of Messiah and, raising an army for this purpose, took the fortress of Amadiya north of Mosul. His project was opposed by the rabbinical authorities and he was poisoned in his sleep. One theory maintains that the Star of David, until then a decorative <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> magical emblem, began to assume its national value in late Jewish tradition from its earlier symbolic use by Menachem.|$|E
25|$|The ABC domain {{consists}} of two domains, the catalytic core domain similar to RecA-like motor ATPases and a smaller, structurally diverse α-helical subdomain that is unique to ABC transporters. The larger domain typically {{consists of}} two β-sheets and six α helices, where the catalytic Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T where X is any amino acid) or P-loop and Walker B motif (ΦΦΦΦD, of which Φ is a hydrophobic residue) is situated. The helical domain consists {{of three or four}} helices and the ABC signature motif, also known as LSGGQ motif, linker peptide or C motif. The ABC domain also has a glutamine residue residing in a flexible loop called Q loop, lid or γ-phosphate switch, that connects the TMD and ABC. The Q loop is presumed {{to be involved in the}} interaction of the NBD and TMD, particularly in the coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis to the conformational changes of the TMD during substrate translocation. The H <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> switch region contains a highly conserved histidine residue that is also important in the interaction of the ABC domain with ATP. The name ATP-binding cassette is derived from the diagnostic arrangement of the folds or motifs of this class of proteins upon formation of the ATP sandwich and ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

[...] Several protective motifs, such as those for the dragon (...) , scorpion, and spider (sometimes called the crab or tortoise by carpet specialists) share the same basic diamond shape with a hooked or stepped boundary, often making them very difficult to distinguish.|$|E
500|$|Other motifs symbolised fertility, as {{with the}} trousseau chest <b>motif</b> (...) , <b>or</b> the {{explicit}} fertility (...) motif. The motif for running water (...) similarly depicts the resource literally. The desire to tie a family or lovers together could be depicted with a fetter motif (...) [...] Similarly, a tombstone motif may indicate not simply death, but the desire to die rather than to part from the beloved. Several motifs represented the desire for good luck and happiness, as for instance the bird (...) and the star or Solomon's seal (...) [...] The oriental symbol of Yin/Yang is used for love and unison (...) [...] Among the motifs used late in life, the Tree of Life (...) symbolizes the desire for immortality. Many of the plants used to represent the Tree of Life {{can also be seen}} as symbols of fruitfulness, fertility, and abundance. Thus the pomegranate, a tree whose fruits carry many seeds, implies the desire for many children.|$|E

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal <b>motifs,</b> <b>or</b> calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other <b>motifs,</b> <b>or</b> they can form the background pattern.|$|R

2500|$|Cohen was {{involved}} with Buddhism beginning in the 1970s and was ordained a Buddhist monk in 1996; he continued to consider himself Jewish: [...] "I'm {{not looking for a}} new religion.

[...] Beginning in the late 1970s, Cohen was associated with Buddhist monk and rōshi (venerable teacher) Kyozan Joshu Sasaki, regularly visiting him at Mount Baldy Zen Center and serving him as personal assistant during Cohen's period of reclusion at Mount Baldy monastery in the 1990s. Sasaki appears as a regular <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> addressee in Cohen's poetry, especially in his Book of Longing, and took part in a 1997 documentary about Cohen's monastery years, Leonard Cohen: Spring 1996.

[...] Here the figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show griffins borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East. [...] On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in {{the centre of the}} exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common Master of Animals <b>motif,</b> <b>or</b> held up empty {{at the side of the}} head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.|$|E
2500|$|When {{not bound}} to netrin-1, [...] an {{intracellular}} domain of DCC is cleaved by a caspase, and induces apoptosis in a caspase-9-dependent pathway. This domain does {{not correspond to}} a known caspase recruitment <b>motif</b> <b>or</b> death sequence domain, but is required to initiate apoptosis. It has been theorized that the domain acts as a scaffold to recruit and activate caspase-9 and caspase-3. This DCC apoptosis pathway is not dependent on either the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway or the death receptor/caspase-8 pathway. In the absence of ligand, DCC interacts with caspase-9 (likely via an unidentified adaptor protein) and promotes the assembly of a caspase-activating complex. This causes the activation of caspase-3 through caspase-9, and initiates apoptosis without {{the formation of an}} apoptosome or cytochrome c release. This implies that DCC regulates a novel pathway for caspase activation, and that it is one that is apoptosome-independent.|$|E
