40|$|We {{examine how}} product market threats {{influence}} firm payout policy and cash holdings. We develop new measures of competitive threats using firms’ product descriptions. Our primary measure, product <b>market</b> <b>fluidity,</b> captures changes in rival firms ’ products {{relative to the}} firm’s products. We show that product <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> decreases firm propensity to pay dividends and repurchase shares and increases the cash a firm holds. Firms which {{are likely to have}} less access to financial markets {{are also more likely to}} hold greater amounts of cash when fluidity is high. These results are consistent with firms’ financial policies being significantly shaped by product market threats and dynamics. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} customer concentration levels on firm cost structure decisions. Analyzing cost data from a sample of manufacturing firms from 1976 through 2013, we find a negative relationship between customer concentration and cost elasticity whereby firms exhibit lower proportions of variable-to-fixed costs {{in the presence of}} higher levels of customer concentration. Additionally, we find that greater customer bargaining power, proxied by supplier industry competition and product <b>market</b> <b>fluidity,</b> leads to lower cost elasticity as customer concentration becomes greater. These results are robust to alternate specifications as well as controlling for endogeneity using a two-stage model. Our results suggest that suppliers respond to customer concentration by pursuing increased mutual dependence and cooperation with customers rather than attempting to reduce the effect of power imbalances within the supplier-customer relationship...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{globalization}} the shift from the national to the global has become an economic reality and advanced the emergence of regional integration groups alongside regional competition policies. In the same vein, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has adopted a regional competition law, which entered into force in 2003. WAEMU follows a centralized approach to its competition policy, in which the Union {{not only has the}} exclusive competence to legislate on anticompetitive practices, but also bears the exclusive decision-making power regarding the enforcement of the law. National competition-law authorities are mainly excluded from the decision-making process and limited to consulting or executive functions. However, the centralized approach is not flawless. The expected reforms in the member states are still pending, the collaboration of national structures and the community is not effective and the regional institutional level, which was supposed to constitute a strong authority, faces severe constraints in terms of resources and flexibility. The regional case law also remains limited. The effectiveness of the community competition law thus far has {{failed to live up to}} its expectations. This paper builds on WAEMU’s eight years experience of enforcement as well as other regional integration experiences, such as ECOWAS or the EU, and identifies a certain number of criteria, which should be taken into account when designing a regional competition policy. The so called “competition constraints” are the number of states and the level of integration of the regional <b>market,</b> the <b>fluidity</b> of trade between member states, the respective institutional capacities of the member states and the Union, the existence or lack of a competition culture in the member states and the time dimension. By analyzing the interaction between the competition constraints and the institutional design of a regional competition policy, one can extract certain principles of orientation regarding the applicable substantive law and the distribution of competences. Applying the lessons learned to the case of WAEMU, the insufficient involvement of the national competition law authorities appears as one of the main deficiencies of the institutional framework of WAEMU. Therefore, this paper calls for a “controlled decentralization”, which includes the installation of a new collaboration framework between the regional and the national level...|$|R

Il étudie ensuite la {{situation}} spécifique au Québec en se concentrant sur les travailleurs déplacés et recyclés. In this paper, {{we examine}} {{the dynamics of the}} labour market, and more precisely the dynamics of unemployment in Quebec relative to Ontario and the whole of Canada. We first find that {{if it is true that}} there exists an important fluidity in the labour <b>market,</b> that <b>fluidity</b> is not sufficient to rapidly solve the unemployment problem. Using the data of a special Statistics Canada survey we then look at unemployment in Quebec, Ontario and Canada from a dynamic point of view. From that perspective, unemployment in Quebec seems even more dramatic than the result of conventional static analysis. Whatever the aspect we concentrate upon the proportion of workers who have lost a full time job and who have not been recalled by the same employer, the proportion of those who have not found a new job, the proportion of those who have not found a new full time job, the proportion of those who have got off the labour force, the proportion of those who have been looking for a full time job for more than six months, the score we get for Quebec is much worse than the one we get, comparing to Ontario and Canada, in a conventional static analysis. We also examine some aspects of the job search process, in Quebec alone. We calculate a «risk of losing a job» rate, a «chance of finding a job» rate and a ranking for some specifie groups according to sex, age, education level and industry. Differences appear to be important. Maies are ranked higher than females; the younger higher than the older; the more educated higher than the less educated and service industries higher than manufacturing industries. The analysis of these differences brings us to the conclusion that due to some special important changes in the market, the free trade agreement for example, some groups would suffer deeply. We then look at one particular manpower program: the training and retraining policy. Only 5 % to 6 % of the target population get services. It is really not much. On the other hand, we know that employment promotion expenditures are less in Canada than in many other industrialized countries. These two facts, taken together, are for us a convincing argument that training and retraining policies should be improved. This conclusion, however important it may be, should not make us forget the sources of unemployment other than the one analyzed here: unemployment due to a qualitative disequilibrium between demand and supply. The other sources of unemployment are really there in Quebec. We must continue to analyze them and fight them...|$|R

40|$|A pay-as-bid {{curtailment}} market, where Wind Power Plants (WPPs) {{may offer}} prices {{to have their}} output reduced {{in the event of}} network balancing or stability constraints, is one approach towards the market integration of a high proportion of wind energy onto a power system. Such a market aims to procure curtailment at a cost close to the marginal value of the electricity plus renewable subsidies and incentives, reducing risks for WPPs while minimising costs to the Independent System Operator (ISO). Through the use of game theory and market modelling, a key set of bidding strategies are identified that may evolve within such a market, which may act in opposition to the goals of the ISO. These are applied to a variety of network conditions in order to determine their likely impact and the resulting bidding signals provided to market participants. Bidding behaviours and <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> may also be affected by factors particular to wind power plants. Through analysis of both ex ante and ex post case studies, the existence of these behaviours is demonstrated, illustrating that a pay-as-bid curtailment market may not be efficient at price discovery in practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: U. S. {{labor markets}} became much less fluid in recent decades. Job {{reallocation}} rates fell {{more than a}} quarter after 1990, and worker reallocation rates fell {{more than a quarter}} after 2000. The declines cut across states, industries and demographic groups defined by age, gender and education. Younger and less educated workers had especially large declines, as did the retail sector. A shift to older businesses, an aging workforce, and policy developments that suppress reallocation all contributed to fluidity declines. Drawing on previous work, we argue that reduced fluidity has harmful consequences for productivity, real wages and employment. To quantify the effects of reallocation intensity on employment, we estimate regression models that exploit low frequency variation over time within states, using state-level changes in population composition and other variables as instruments. We find large positive effects of worker reallocation rates on employment, especially for young workers and the less educated. Similar estimates obtain when dropping data from the Great Recession and its aftermath. These results suggest the U. S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession, and that sustained high employment is unlikely to return without restoring labor <b>market</b> <b>fluidity...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study re-examines the {{relationship}} between competition and innovation in a detailed firm-level dataset of publicly traded US companies spanning from 1975 to 2013. Using R&D expenditures, patent counts and patent citations as the measures of innovation, and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Lerner Index, Profit Elasticity and Product <b>Market</b> <b>Fluidity</b> as the proxies for competition we document a robust positive association between the two variables, as well as strong evidence of the non-linear relationship known as "inverted-U shape", when controlling for size, distance to technological frontier, level of knowledge spillovers, technological opportunities and other firm- and industry-specific characteristics. We address overdispersion in the data by using negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial count data regressions, {{and the results are}} robust in these specifications. Additionally, in order to address potential endogeneity issues, we employ a set of instruments based on the import tariff rates and the level of Chinese import penetration, and find a weak evidence of positive relationship as well. Overall the results strongly support the prediction of agency models, "replacement effect" and "escape- competition effect" about the positive influence of competition on innovation.

40|$|Ryan Decker, Ron Jarmin and Javier Miranda. Thanks to Lucia Foster for helpful {{comments}} on a preliminary draft. 1 The U. S. has exhibited a substantial and pervasive decline in measures of business dynamism, entrepreneurship and labor <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> {{in the last several}} decades. We have learned this through the relatively recent development of comprehensive longitudinal business databases tracking the private, non-farm sector of the U. S. Numerous studies have documented the decline and explored its causes and consequences. 1 In this short synopsis, the basic facts of this decline are summarized by highlighting the top ten signs of the decline. Before discussing the top ten facts, it is useful to provide some brief remarks about whether these trends have adverse consequences for U. S. economic growth. A hallmark of the U. S. economy has been a high pace of job and worker reallocation with a high pace of business entry and exit. The evidence shows that this dynamism and flexibility of the U. S. labor market has been important for productivity growth, earnings growth and job creation. The reallocation of jobs across businesses historically has reflected moving resources from less productive to mor...|$|E
40|$|U. S. CPS data {{indicate}} that in recessions firms actually increase their hiring rates from the pools of the unemployed {{and out of the}} labor force. Why so? The paper provides an explanation by studying the optimal recruiting behavior of the representative firm. The model combines labor frictions, of the search and matching type, with capital frictions, of the q-model type. Optimal firm behavior {{is a function of the}} value of jobs, i. e., the expected present value of the marginal worker to the firm. These are estimated to be counter-cyclical, the underlying reason being the dynamic behavior of the labor share of GDP. The counter-cyclicality of hiring rates and job values, which may appear counter-intuitive, is shown to be consistent with well-known business cycle facts. The analysis emphasizes the difference between current labor productivity and the wider, forwardlooking concept of job values. The paper explains the high volatility of firm recruiting behavior, as well as the reduction over time in labor <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> in the U. S., using the same estimated model. Part of the explanation has to do with job values and another part with the interaction of hiring and investment costs, both determinants having been typically overlooked...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to explore the {{evolution}} of a company’s business model, analyzing how external changes due to the market turbulence can determine the reshaping of the previously adopted model. Considering the case of a Mobile Middleware Technology Provider (MMTP), the study assesses how the <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> impacts on a firm’s approach towards business modeling, by comparing the business model designed right before the company’s market entry, to the one present after two years of activity within the industry. Employing the longitudinal single case study methodology, the research identifies which are the most critical choices to be made at a business modeling level for a MMTP, and shows how these parameters can be combined to constitute a thorough configuration; afterwards, a comparison is carried out between the initial and the current business models adopted, so to identify any change in the parameters prioritization and in the approach towards business modeling as a whole. The research findings allow to provide a business model parameters reference model for MMTPs. Moreover, the longitudinal comparison makes evident that not only the market’s characteristics, but also the initial strategic approach towards the new business, strongly affect the firm’s business model definition process...|$|E
40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have pointed out}} that if marketing is to develop as a discipline and contribute to solving complex business and societal challenges, it should question the neoclassical view of markets and develop its own theory of markets. Efforts in this direction indicate an emerging view of markets as dynamic, subjective, and subject to multiple change efforts. However, the neoclassical view of objective, detached, and deterministic market still influences the dominant models used to describe market change. We argue that in order to better understand market dynamics, both academics and practitioners need new concepts and constructs that go beyond existing linear process and development stage models. We seek to contribute to improved understanding of markets by studying a special characteristic of markets that enables market dynamics. Borrowing a term used by Alderson (1957 : 277), we propose that markets are characterized by plasticity, that is, a “potentiality for being remolded and responding in a different way thereafter. ” Even though the plasticity concept was introduced into the marketing literature nearly 60 years ago, the plastic character of markets remains underresearched. This article investigates the meaning and manifestations of market plasticity, drawing analogies from the physical, natural, and social sciences. We define market plasticity as the market’s capacity to take and retain form and propose that the dialectic between market stability and <b>market</b> <b>fluidity</b> {{lies at the heart of}} market change...|$|E
