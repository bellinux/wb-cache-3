25|$|The <b>margining</b> of futures {{eliminates}} {{much of this}} {{credit risk}} by forcing the holders to update daily {{to the price of}} an equivalent forward purchased that day. This means that there will usually be very little additional money due on the final day to settle the futures contract: only the final day's gain or loss, not the gain or loss {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E
25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their underlying asset. This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular counterparty risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty, thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no risk on the actual counterparty to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central counterparty clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient <b>margining</b> process.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} {{the risk of a}} counter party to default, a technique called portfolio <b>margining</b> is applied, which simply means that the assets within a portfolio are clustered and sorted by the descending projected net loss, e.g. calculated by a pricing model.

50|$|<b>Margining</b> risk is a {{financial}} risk that future cash flows {{are smaller than}} expected due to the payment of margins, i.e. a collateral as deposit from a counterparty to cover some (or all) of its credit risk.

50|$|In trading, {{clearing}} {{is necessary}} because {{the speed of}} trades is much faster than the cycle time for completing the underlying transaction. It involves the management of post-trading, pre-settlement credit exposures to ensure that trades are settled in accordance with market rules, even if a buyer or seller should become insolvent prior to settlement. Processes included in clearing are reporting/monitoring, risk <b>margining,</b> netting of trades to single positions, tax handling, and failure handling.|$|E

As stress-induced failures occur, the cause should be determined, and if possible, the problem should be repaired so that the test can continue to find other weaknesses.|$|E
