50|$|All RISCstations used a {{standard}} IBM AT-style tower or <b>minitower</b> <b>case,</b> a motherboard which also met the AT form factor standard, and PCI peripherals (such as the video card) for peripheral expansion.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, the 950 was {{overtaken}} {{in performance}} by the less expensive Quadra 800 and 840AV. The newer Quadras had the addition of interleaved RAM, {{as well as an}} enhanced video system and SCSI bus. However, their more compact (<b>minitower)</b> <b>case</b> proved difficult to work with, and the 950 (due to its full tower case allowing 6 slots (5 NuBus and one PDS) to be supported) was kept in continued production for the server market, outliving the 800 and 840AV.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{computers}} {{to be part}} of the Macintosh Quadra series were the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900, both introduced in 1991 with a central processing unit (CPU) speed of 25 MHz. The 700 was a compact model using the same case dimensions as the Macintosh IIci, with a Processor Direct Slot (PDS) expansion slot, while the latter was a newly designed tower case with five NuBus expansion slots and one PDS slot. The 900 was replaced in 1992 with the Quadra 950, with a CPU speed of 33 MHz. The line was joined by a number of [...] "800-series" [...] machines in a new <b>minitower</b> <b>case</b> design, starting with the Quadra 800, and the [...] "600-series" [...] pizza box desktop cases with the Quadra 610.|$|E
5000|$|Colocation {{web hosting}} service: {{similar to the}} {{dedicated}} web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and {{takes care of the}} server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of web hosting service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client's machine, providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the client would have his own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes. Formerly, many colocation providers would accept any system configuration for hosting, even ones housed in desktop-style <b>minitower</b> <b>cases,</b> but most hosts now require rack mount enclosures and standard system configurations.|$|R
50|$|The Macintosh IIcx was {{introduced}} by Apple Computer in 1989, half {{a year after the}} introduction of the Macintosh IIx. The IIcx resembled the IIx to a great extent and provided the same performance, but was quieter (due to its quieter fan on a smaller power supply) than its predecessor. Reducing the number of NuBus slots from 6 to 3 also made the machine much more compact. The new case, Apple's first to be designed to operate in either a horizontal or vertical orientation, remained in use for its successors the IIci and Quadra 700. The idea for vertical orientation, one of the first <b>minitower</b> <b>cases,</b> was suggested by Apple CEO John Sculley, who was running out of space on his desk, {{despite the fact that the}} new layout actually took more space once the monitor was taken into account. The model was designated IIcx for compact (echoing the earlier Apple IIc compact model in the Apple II series), and the x was Apple's designation for the 68030 processor.|$|R
