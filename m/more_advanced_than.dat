The lighting system in the Wii version is <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E

5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> Mercury, capable of {{supporting}} two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda did {{not develop}} a {{negative}} connotation {{until it was}} used in Nazi propaganda for World War II. Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. The Nazi party used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former {{are the basic}} troops of the Gorn forces, and while they can run on four legs, they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed {{a very strong}} position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
