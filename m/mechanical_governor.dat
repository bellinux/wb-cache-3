50|$|Different {{designs of}} {{governors}} {{have been used}} since the mid-19th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of flyball systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control {{the amount of water}} that enters the turbines. Newer systems with <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors</b> started around 1880. An early <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors</b> is a servomechanism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors</b> were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors</b> had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors.</b> In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed sensor but the controls were still done through analog systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor.|$|R

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} without load and speed {{controller}} is a nonlinear astatic object. The torque and moment of internal friction (the diesel engine without load and governor) cross {{in the field}} of the engine's destruction (the speed limit was exceeded). Hence, the diesel engine is equipped with a speed governor. The main task of the governor is to counteract exceeding of the speed limit. We did a research on the engine with an injection pump wherein the conventional centrifugal governor was replaced by the microprocessor controller.

50|$|From the {{earliest}} phonograph designs, {{many of which}} were powered by spring-wound mechanisms, a speed governor was essential. Most of these employed some type of flywheel-friction disc to control the speed of the rotating cylinder or turntable; as the speed increased, centrifugal force caused a brake—often a felt pad—to rub against a smooth metal surface, slowing rotation. Electrically powered turntables, whose rotational speed was governed by other means, eventually made their mechanical counterparts obsolete. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>governor</b> was, however, still employed in some toy phonographs (such as those found in talking dolls) until they were replaced by digital sound generators in the late 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 89 The boiler {{feedwater}} {{system in}} a world scale ethylene plant utilized horizontal multistage barrel case pumps and single stage impulse type steam turbine drivers with <b>mechanical</b> <b>governors.</b> As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and inboard bearing bracket stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke governor valve stems. The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out. These problems became very high profile when the newly rerated boiler feedwater pumps tripped and caused a total plant shutdown resulting in a 14 hr flare.

50|$|As {{is common}} in {{automatic}} transmissions of its generation, power brought to the transmission via the torque converter drives hydraulic fluid. As the gears move faster or slower, pressure of the fluid increases or decreases in the case. Mechanical switching of gears is triggered by the increase or decrease of pressure. There are no electronic sensors or switches as found in modern transmissions. There is a Throttle Valve in the control valve body that {{is connected to the}} throttle linkage via a cable. This regulates internal pressure by throttle position.

50|$|Most present-day {{diesel engines}} use a {{mechanical}} single plunger high-pressure fuel pump {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use injectors that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>governor,</b> consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever. The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit. The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder {{in order to obtain}} the same pressure delay.|$|E

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of fossil energy resources {{in conjunction with}} increasing demand has recently created record commodity price rises. Global warming and dimming {{are some of the}} harmful effects of increasing use of this resource. Furthermore, fossil fuel exhaust emissions, produced in internal combustion engines (ICE), generate significant health concerns. For decades, fears and numerous alarms have been raised regarding these problems. Many researchers believe that hydrogen would be an ideal alternative solution. Reduced fossil fuel consumption and lower thermal emanations (CO, CO 2, HC and NO) are expected if hydrogen is used, as a principal or supplementary fuel, in standard ICE’s. However, hydrogen dual-fuel use has historically been associated with injection and/or detonation problems. Direct injection (DI) strategy, in spark and compression engines, is commonly used to overcome some, but not all, of these difficulties. This experimental research investigated detonation free, diesel-hydrogen fuel consumptions, and exhaust emissions using an indirect injection (IDI) strategy in a generic compression diesel engine. A novel analogue Mechatronic Injection Unit (MICU) in conjunction with a multi point injection tactic (MPI) were devised to indirectly deliver low pressure hydrogen to a stationary Lister-Pitter diesel engine combustion chamber. The hydrogen injection system was created {{to be used as a}} generic dual-fuel kit. With off-the-shelf parts the MICU design was simple, robust, and purposeful in its function. The MICU component also formed an important element of a proposed innovative dual-fuel conversion kit. Nine hydrogen injection rates were tested. Diesel consumption savings were measured and the ‘effectiveness’ of hydrogen vitiated injection was computed. The research outcomes demonstrated that with a conventional diesel <b>mechanical</b> <b>governor</b> and an assumed engine compression ratio of 15. 5, detonation free combustion can be achieved with low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment. However, an injection rate limit existed above which detonation occurred. The study also demonstrated that through low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, diesel consumption savings were achieved. The research confirmed that the experimental fuel mass savings were lower than their expected/theoretical counterparts. The research particularly established that vitiation and enrichment effectiveness was only realised at low rather than high loads indicating that hydrogen achieved more than diesel mass substitutions. In this study a new confined area dual-fuel static emission testing procedure, coupled with an on-site use test cycle was proposed and termed the Dual-fuel fixed speed emission-testing guideline. Dry thermal emissions were measured, and both the cycle average and median dry- and wet-emissions were computed, substance/species comparisons were performed and conclusions were drawn. The shortcomings of the procedure however were also highlighted. Finally, the research established that one action or measure, such as dual-fuel hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, can not address all the environment and health concerns. Contrary to the common belief, green house gases, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and opacity substances do not coincidently all increase and/or decrease. Indeed, this experiment demonstrated that although the diesel-hydrogen nitrogen monoxide (NO) wet-emissions at all injection rates were partially lower than the diesel baseline, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon emissions, opacity (N) and absorption coefficients (k) were higher. In other words, a measure taken to limit the harm done to human health can increase the damage to the environment and vice versa...|$|E

Essential power for emergency services were restored to the ship, enabling the crew to handle any flooding or fire that would occur.

50|$|When {{starting}} from cold, the engine's combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat {{out of the}} cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have <b>mechanical</b> and hydraulic <b>governor</b> control to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled glow plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.|$|R
50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a <b>mechanical</b> speed <b>governor</b> that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|R
5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a <b>mechanical</b> or electronic <b>governor</b> which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the operation of an indirect injection, naturally aspirated, diesel engine under transient conditions resulting from a rapid increase in load. For this purpose, a single-zone thermodynamic model, following the filling and emptying modelling technique, is developed, which accounts for all basic parts of the thermodynamic engine operation; it also covers the dynamic simulation of the engine with special submodels to model the conservation of energy in the crankshaft, the inertia forces, the governor dynamics and the fuel pump characteristics. Unlike most previous models, the transient operation is not regarded as a series of steady state operating points, but care has been taken for the special characteristics of this unsteady operation. To this aim, analytical expressions were derived for the better simulation of combustion, <b>mechanical</b> friction and <b>governor</b> movement, which during the transient operation behave in a different way than at steady state. The model has been tested favourably (at steady state conditions) against results derived from detailed experimental work conducted at the authors' laboratory. A detailed parametric study is made, which includes the influence of a variety of dynamic and thermodynamic parameters on the transient response of the particular engine, as well as of a four-cylinder one with the same technical characteristics. For the latter case, a special multi-cylinder engine model has been developed, accounting in detail for the solution of the governing differential equations for every cylinder separately. Analytical diagrams for the effect of the operating parameters on the transient operation of the two typical properties of speed droop and recovery period are given, which quantify each parameter's contribution. Finally, the effect of a faulty fuel injection system on one cylinder of the four-cylinder engine is studied, providing important information about the engine's non-optumum operation.
