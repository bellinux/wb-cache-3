40|$|A system {{approach}} {{was used for}} the development of a new process concept for solar driven thermochemical redox cycles. Two aspects of this concept will be presented here. Since a high heat recovery rate for cycles using non-stoichiometric reduction has been identified as elementary in order to reach meaningful overall process efficiencies, a special focus was directed on this aspect. A quasi-countercurrent heat recovery system, which makes use of a particulate heat transfer medium, was outlined and numerically analyzed. The analysis shows that recovery rates of more than 70 % seem realistic. Even though the heat recovery system is based on an arrangement of stages including relative complex flow pattern the basic principle seems promising and opens up new pathways for system design and optimization. The second aspect highlighted of the developed process concept is the use of a <b>multi</b> <b>chamber</b> system with optimized reaction conditions for the reduction of the redox material.

The picture of fields of speeds of gases in working volume is received and the analysis concerning efficiency of their use in a zone of an arrangement of metal products which heat up is carried out. It is established that {{the main part of}} warmth heats the top part of the furnace and only then falls down cameras where gases of insignificant density contact to metal, at the same time their bigger quantity just is removed through smoke windows, without having given warmth. The last leads to an excessive consumption of primary energy resource and reduction of power efficiency of the furnace in general.

40|$|The {{practice}} of re-melting glass was well known, certainly from the Roman period onwards. This {{can be seen}} not only in ancient literary evidence {{but also in the}} archaeological evidence, collections of broken glass have been found in, for example, Pompeii (79 AD) and the Iulia Felix shipwreck (Third century AD). Elevated levels of certain transition metals in archaeological glasses are interpreted as indications of the mixing and/or recycling of different glasses. Assumptions have been made that all glasses could be recycled, but to what extent are these valid? Why does the evidence for the recycling of glass only occur from the Roman period onwards? From the middle of the First millennium BC to the Ninth century AD, natron glass was the predominant glass type in the Mediterranean and Europe, however, plant ash glass was still in use in some areas. To test the effects on the final product of mixing different composition glass types, experimental glasses were made by mixing varying quantities of replica plant ash glass, replica natron glass, and a modern glass. At low temperatures crystalline material formed in the products containing replica plant ash glass. As the plant ash glass content increased, so too did the amount of crystalline material produced. This is due to a combination of the glass compositions and the firing temperature. It appears that natron type glass can be more easily recycled at lower temperatures, although, if a high enough temperature is used then most glass types can be recycled. Early furnace technology, i. e. the vertical heating <b>chamber</b> <b>furnace,</b> may {{not have been able to}} achieve these high temperatures, hence the widespread {{practice of}} recycling did not begin until after the invention of glassblowing which required a change in the furnace technology to the use of a horizontal heating <b>chamber</b> <b>furnace...</b>|$|R

Elite Thermal Systems Ltd is a leading manufacturer of electric laboratory <b>chamber</b> <b>furnaces</b> in UK. With the increase in product competition, the company needed {{to develop a new}} laboratory electric <b>chamber</b> (LERC) <b>furnace</b> design. To achieve this, the company initiated a knowledge transfer partnership (KTP) scheme. This research which {{is an integral part of}} the KTP was aimed at developing a new laboratory furnace design. During this development, a "FrontEnd Process" development lifecycle was followed. The specified product capacity was 6. 2 L as defined by the product organisation. The development was initiated with market research. This included interviewing and tabling results of 30 furnace users followed by a competitor analysis. A quality functional deployment (QFD) matrix was also developed prior to the formation of the initial product specifications. A range of concepts for the prototype design were analysed in selected subassemblies. The optimal overall design concept was selected upon preparation and analysis of concept screening matrices developed for product subassemblies. The finalised overall concept resulted in a novel furnace assembly design which includes a unique modular mono structure and a power assisted door mechanism for the user. Prototyping was carried out using basic in-house tools. Thermal, mechanical and performance analysis on the prototype was carried out which led to further design improvements. A combination of finite element tools were also used in validating the design. The final design presented in this thesis provides final specifications for the preproduction model.
