5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids {{the country}} from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as <b>Moldovan</b> Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO {{as part of a}} larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway <b>Moldovan</b> region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.|$|E

The Początek i progres wojny moskiewskiej (The {{beginning}} and Progress of the Muscovy War), published in 1612, is a critique of Zygmunt's policies. In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisław Koniecpolski, future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and <b>Moldovan</b> incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project O chowaniu żołnierza kwarcianego (On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers), in which he argued for the need to raise a larger army {{to deal with the}} Tatars and the Cossacks. The project was however not approved by the parliament.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Moldovan</b> {{government}} was not pleased with this situation, since they viewed it as a de facto recognition of Transnistria. In October 2001 <b>Moldovan</b> president Vladimir Voronin addressed the issue with his Polish counterpart.|$|E
25|$|These {{concerns}} found expressing in the activism of the <b>Moldovan</b> Movement in Support of Restructuring—a {{movement of}} the intelligentsia oriented mostly towards generalized economic and political liberalization—and the Alexei Mateevici Literary-Musical Club, which pulled together prominent cultural and political figures, activists and citizens to celebrate and discuss <b>Moldovan</b> language, literature and history. Cultural revival {{was just one of}} the issues championed by such informals in early 1988. However, during the course of that year events around the Soviet Union, and particularly the bloody clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagornyi Karabakh and the pogrom against Armenians in Sumgait, brought issues of ethnicity increasingly to the fore in the union press. In Moldova, social movements increasingly began to focus on three issues involving language: the identity of the <b>Moldovan</b> and Romanian language, the artificiality of the use of the Cyrillic alphabet for the <b>Moldovan</b> language, and need for <b>Moldovan</b> to be given the status of official language of the republic. By June 1988, the <b>Moldovan</b> republican government began taking its cue from social movement leaders and discussing these issues, touching off the events that culminated in the creation of the Pridnestrovian state.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moldovan</b> language, in its {{official}} form, is practically identical to Romanian, {{although there are}} some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of Transnistria, the official script used to write <b>Moldovan</b> is Cyrillic.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Romanians and <b>Moldovans</b> were {{presented}} as separate categories in the census results, {{has been criticized}} by the Romanian Community of Ukraine - Interregional Union, which complains that this old Soviet-era practice, results in the Romanian population being undercounted, as being divided between Romanians and <b>Moldovans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{controversy}} whether Romanians and <b>Moldovans</b> are the same ethnic group, namely whether Moldovans' self-identification constitutes an ethnic group distinct and apart from Romanians or a subset. There were also numerous allegations that the ethnic affiliation numbers were rigged: 7 out of 10 observer groups of the Council of Europe reported {{a significant number of}} cases where census-takers recommended respondents declare themselves <b>Moldovans</b> rather than Romanians. Complicating the interpretation of the results, 18.8% of respondents that identified themselves as <b>Moldovans</b> declared Romanian to be their native language.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, in Romania, {{people from}} Wallachia and Transylvania call the Romanians inhabiting western Moldavia, {{now part of}} Romania, as <b>Moldovans.</b> People in Romanian Moldova call {{themselves}} <b>Moldovans,</b> as subethnic denomination, and Romanians, as ethnic denomination (like Kentish and English for English people living in Kent). Romanians from Romania call the Romanians of the Republic of Moldova Bessarabians, as identification inside the subethnic group, <b>Moldovans</b> as subethnic group and Romanians as ethnic group. The subethnic groups referred to here are historically connected to independent Principalities. The Principality of Moldavia/Moldova founded in 1349 had various extensions between 1349 and 1859 and comprised Bucovina and Bessarabia as regional subdivisions. That way, Romanians of southern Bukovina (today part of Romania and formerly part of the historical Moldova) are called Bukovinans, <b>Moldovans</b> and Romanians.|$|R
25|$|The major {{denomination}} in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The {{majority of}} <b>Moldovan</b> Orthodox Christians {{belong to the}} <b>Moldovan</b> Orthodox Church, {{a branch of the}} Russian Orthodox Church, while a minority belongs to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, a branch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Both bodies are in full communion, the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan See of Bessarabia. As of 2007, the <b>Moldovan</b> Orthodox Church has 1255 parishes, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia has 219.|$|E
25|$|Amnesty International {{accused the}} <b>Moldovan</b> {{government}} of violating human rights through {{the actions of}} the police, that it detained indiscriminately hundreds of protesters, including minors, who were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.

25|$|In 1940, during World War II, Romania {{agreed to}} an {{ultimatum}} and ceded the region to the Soviet Union, which organized it into the Moldavian SSR. The Soviets began a campaign to strengthen the <b>Moldovan</b> identity {{different from that of}} the rest of Romanian speakers, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of the Bessarabia into the interwar Romania (see also Moldovenism). The official Soviet policy also stated that Romanian and <b>Moldovan</b> were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, <b>Moldovan</b> had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the <b>Moldovan</b> Cyrillic alphabet) based on the Russian Cyrillic, rather than the older Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the Romanian Old Kingdom and 1917 in Bessarabia.|$|E
