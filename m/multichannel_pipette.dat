40|$|As {{a result}} of the AiF {{research}} project No 11503 N 1 "Test and Improvement of the Measuring Accuracy of Multichannel Piston Pipettes", the time for testing a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette</b> was reduced from 11 - 12 hours (using the nominal gravimetric test method) or 6 hours (using a modified gravimetric method) to 1. 5 hours by developing a semiautomatic gravimetric unit with weighing cells operating with strain gauges (testing unit 1). This was achieved by simultaneously pipetting with up to 12 channels and then simultaneously weighing the dispensed fluid volume. For this purpose, a testing unit was constructed in which the distance between the weighing scales is equal to the distance between the channels of a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette</b> (= 9 mm). By the use of weighing cells with strain gauges, a weighing accuracy was obtained that corresponds to an analytical balance of 0. 1 mg resolution. Thus, this unit can test multichannel pipettes with a nominal volume from 50 to 300 µ. It was not possible to further increase resolution and accuracy by using strain gauges. Based on previous experience, a second, significantly optimised unit (testing unit 2) was developed. The most important new aspect was the introduction of weighing cells with electromagnetic force compensation, as they are used in semi-microbalances. Using this new testing unit, pipettes with a nominal volume of up to 10 µ can be tested in significantly reduced time. For the very first time, a complete, standardised gravimetric test of a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette</b> was performed in less than 15 minutes. The gravimetric test of multichannel pipettes by four different producers showed that no pipettes exceeded the maximum number of errors permitted in DIN 12650 - 8. The dispensed volume of multichannel pipettes is adjustable between approximately 10 % of the nominal volume and the nominal volume. At the lowest adjustable volume, the uncertainty of measurement was reduced on average to approximately 50 % of that obtained at the nominal volume. Slight deviations occurred at different nominal volumes and between different producers. With few exceptions, the dispensed volumes of the individual channels were more or less equal. Compared with manual pipettes, electronic pipettes showed fewer systematic and random errors...|$|E
40|$|Many {{experimental}} designs {{require the}} analysis of genomic DNA from {{a large number of}} samples. Although the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used, the Southern blot is preferred for many assays because of its inherent reliability. The rapid acceptance of PCR, despite a significant rate of false positive/negative results, is partly due to the disadvantages of the sample preparation process for Southern blot analysis. We have devised a rapid protocol to extract high-molecular-weight genomic DNA from a large number of samples. It involves the use of a single 96 -well tissue culture dish to carry out all the steps of the sample preparation. This, coupled {{with the use of a}} <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette,</b> facilitates the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples. The procedure may be automated since no centrifugation, mixing, or transferring of the samples is necessary. The method has been used to screen embryonic stem cell clones for the presence of targeted mutations at the Hox- 2. 6 locus and to obtain data from human blood...|$|E
50|$|The {{fluctuation}} {{method is}} comparable to the traditional pour plate method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, however, it does have a number of advantages: it needs less test sample, it has a simple colorimetric endpoint, counting the number of positive wells out of possible 96 or 48 wells is much less time consuming than counting individual colonies on an agar plate. Several commercial kits are available. Most kits have consumable components in a ready-to-use state, including lyophilized bacteria, and tests can be performed using <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipettes.</b> The fluctuation method also allows for testing higher volumes of aqueous samples (up to 75% v/v), increasing the sensitivity and extending its application to low-level environmental mutagens.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a plate-based cloning and expression strategy for efficient high-throughput generation of validated expression clones in Escherichia coli. The process incorporates 48 - or 96 -well plates at all stages including the cloning and colony selection phases {{which are often}} performed manually. A 48 -grid agar growth plate has been integrated into the colony selection component to improve throughput at the cloning stage. The combinations of 48 - and 96 -well plate formats are compatible with automated liquid handlers and <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipettes.</b> This revised cloning and expression pipeline increases throughput significantly, and also results in a reduction in both time and material requirements.

40|$|Biological safety {{cabinets}} (BSCs) {{are designed}} to protect the operator, the laboratory environment and work materials from exposure to infectious aerosols and splashes that may be generated when manipulating materials containing infectious agents, such as primary cultures, stocks and diagnostic specimens. Aerosol particles are created by any activity that imparts energy into a liquid or semiliquid material, such as shaking, pouring, stirring or dropping liquid onto a surface or into another liquid. Other laboratory activities, such as streaking agar plates, inoculating cell culture flasks with a pipette, using a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette</b> to dispense liquid suspensions of infectious agents into microculture plates, homogenizing and vortexing infectious materials, and centrifugation of infectious liquids, or working with animals, can generate infectious aerosols. Aerosol particles of less than 5 µm in diameter and small droplets of 5 – 100 µm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. The laboratory worker is generally not aware that such particles are being generated and may be inhaled or may crosscontaminate work surface materials.

Add remaining ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Use a beaker with handles to pour hot fly food onto the prepared trays. Let the food cool to room temperature before storing at 4 ° C. - For each step prepare enough reaction mix for 110 reactions per plate. - Hydrate G- 50 plate while running the PCR to save time. - Individual wells are very full and if the plate is not properly sealed contamination can occur. It is best to use 8 -strip PCR caps rather than aluminum plate sealers to prevent cross-contamination. - Resuspension buffer waste must be discarded into properly labeled Formamide waste container. - The nylon membranes must not overlay each other to ensure proper contact with the antibody solution. Therefore, if using more than one nylon membrane per tube, the length of individual membrane sheets should be no more that 11 cm. - Preparation of Controls. Spot 1 µl of each of 5 dilutions (1 : 3. 3, 1 : 10, 1 : 33, 1 : 100, and 1 : 330) of several different probes onto DIG Quantification Teststrips. Take the loaded DIG Quantification Teststrips and a DIG Control Teststrip through the quantification procedure. Evaluate which of the probe dilution series best approaches the control teststrip. Prepare an adequate amount of this probe dilution series and store at - 80 °C for future use. - Cover the Hybaid oven door with aluminum foil. Keep the developed nylon membranes in the dark even after stopping the color reaction, otherwise they will turn completely blue over time. - Developing solution must be discarded into a properly labeled NBT/BCIP waste container. - If the probe spot is at least as intense as the 1 : 330 control spot the RNA probe reaction was successful and the RNA probe is ready to be used in hybridization. - Flies lay better in the dark. Keep the fly cages in a room without windows or cover cages with a light-tight dark cloth. - For maximum egg deposition make sure the fly food trays and yeast paste are at room temperature before placing in the fly cage. - The paste has to be easily spreadable, so that the fly food will not separate from the tray, but not too watery so that the flies will not stick to the paste. - Hybridization assays are conducted usingstaged embryos from 0 to 18 hrs post fertilization. Due to uneven egg deposition during this period, embryos are collected in 3 hr intervals (0 - 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12, 12 - 15, 15 - 18) to ensure equal representation of all developmental stages in the master mix made by combining equal amounts of embryos from each 3 hr interval. - Example of Embryo Collection Schedule ![Table 4]([URL] "Table 4 ") Carefully remove any flies that may have stuck to the fly food or the yeast paste to prevent further egg deposition. While removing the flies take care not to damage the deposited embryos. 17. Pour enough deionized H 20 on the tray to cover the entire area. Use paintbrush to collect the embryos from the tray and carefully pour them into the prepared three level sieve. The first sieve (20) will collect pieces of loose agar, the second sieve(40) will collect loose fly parts (e. g. abdomens, wings and heads) and the third sieve will collect the clean embryos. 18. Must be large enough to contain one level of the sieve and high enough so that the embryos in the sieve are can be submerged in liquid. (e. g. 100 % bleach, deionized H 20). 19. Timing of this step is critical. If the embryos are left in bleach for too long they will be irreparably damaged. 20. Heptane must be discarded into a properly labeled heptane waste container. 21. Formaldehyde/PBS mixture must be prepared fresh just prior to use. Formaldehyde is a classified as a human carcinogen and should be handled with caution and discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 22. When removing the upper (heptane) phase, start at the interphase and work your way up. Use Falcon Pipetaid. 23. Good embryos, unbroken embryos devoid of chorion and vitelline membranes, will sink to the bottom. Embryos remaining at interphase are damaged and should not be used in hybridization. 24. Methanol must be discarded into a properly labeled methanol waste container. 25. Do not put more than 7 ml of embryos in a 50 ml falcon tube. Lay the falcon tube on its side to prevent crushing the embryos. 26. The embryo master mix is created by combining equal volumes of embryos of all collected stages. It is best to measure out the individual stages in an eppendorf tube and then transfer individual time intervals into a prepared falcon tube. Let the embryos settle to ensure equal volumes. Easiest way to transfer the embryos is by turning the eppendorf tube upside down above the falcon tube and washing out the embryos with methanol using the pipetaid. 27. Waste from steps 3, 4 and 5 of the hybridization protocol (3. 2. 3) must be discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 28. Use 12 ml total (9 ml methanol, 2. 88 ml PBS, 120 ul formaldehyde) -prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 29. Use 12 ml total (3 ml methanol, 8. 64 ml PBS, 360 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 30. Use 12 ml total (11. 52 ml PBS, 480 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 31. Hybridization buffer with and without dextran sulfate and wash buffer must be discarded into a properly labeled Formamide waste container. 32.

40|$|Abstract A {{novel and}} simple DNA {{extraction}} method was developed, which was called “the filter-inserted tip method”. This method used glass fiber filters inserted within micropipette tips. It {{was conducted by}} drawing and expelling fluid by pipetting using a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette.</b> This allowed us to manipulate {{a large number of}} samples at the same time for DNA adsorption, fixing, washing and extraction. The 3 mm� 3 mm size of glass fiber filter was suitable for this method. To examine the reproducibility of the method, DNA extraction experiment was carried out using rice leaves, and the yielded DNA samples were used for PCR reactions. As a result, PCR amplifications were recognized for 234 out of 236 samples examined, showing high reproducibility of the method. It took approximately 20 min to conduct DNA extractions from 16 samples. These results suggest that this method is suitable for rapid DNA extractions from a large number of samples for PCR reactions, such as marker-assisted selection with simple manipulations, low cost, and without using expensive equipment.

The methods attain high resolution of small mobility differences using long (30 cm) gels and use a modified polymerase reaction to maximise detection sensitivity using a minimised quantity of 32 P. By using custom cut "sharktooth" combs (4. 5 mm between teeth) as the slot formers, commercially available <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipettes</b> (9 mm tip to tip) can be used to load eight or 12 samples at a time from standard microtitre plates. PCR products that have been prepared and radiolabelled using simplified protocols are loaded on to the gel, and after a precalculated time of electrophoresis another set of samples can be loaded, either with combs moved across 2. 25 mm or onto the same gel tracks. The run conditions are calculated so that there is no overlap between the bands produced by the two loadings, thus doubling the amount of information that can be gained from one gel. A computer program has been developed to solve equations to determine suitable timings for repetitive loadings. Finally, a modification of the gel pouring system is described so that two gels can be poured between three standard glass plates, with both gels run simultaneously. Of the order of 1000 PCR reactions can be prepared and analysed in 24 man hours using five 40 cm x 30 cm gel tanks. The application of these techniques is described to detect SSCPs in exon 3 of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in 791 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).

In {{response to this}} opportunity, structural genomics projects have been initiated world-wide {{with the aim of}} establishing high-throughput structure determination on a genome-wide scale. Crucial to this effort has been the development of protein production technologies for the highthroughput cloning, expression, and purification of proteins.

Bernard 1 Corresponding author ([nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca](nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca)). ### INTRODUCTION The {{enzyme-linked}} immunospot (ELISPOT) assay {{measures the}} secretion intensity of effector molecules released by immune cells {{in response to}} ex vivo antigenic stimulation, {{as well as the}} frequency of these responding cells. This assay is highly sensitive, quantitative, easy to use, and amenable to high-throughput screening. For these reasons, the ELISPOT assay is considered by many as a gold standard for monitoring cellular immune responses. Until recently, ELISPOT assays using chromophores to detect the T cell secretion of cytokines were limited to the characterization of a single effector molecule. Notably, studies evaluating the immune response to chronic viral infections often measured IFN-γ secretion by ELISPOT because of the known antiviral effects of this cytokine as well as its correlation to the cytotoxic capacity of T cells. However, maintenance of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion by pathogen-specific T cells has been linked to a more favorable clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Leishmania infections. Therefore, an ELISPOT assay able to simultaneously characterize T cell responses in terms of IL- 2 and IFN-γ secretion is potentially relevant for the monitoring of immune responses to certain infectious agents. In this protocol, we describe an ELISPOT assay for the simultaneous detection of IL- 2 and IFN-γ upon stimulation with viral peptides. ### RELATED INFORMATION Early uses of the ELISPOT assay for studies of immune cell secretion intensity and frequency are described in Currier et al. (2002) and Czerkinsky et al. (1988). The principles of the ELISPOT assay are reviewed in Letsch and Scheibenbogen (2003), and its use in high-throughput screening is described in Hernandez-Fuentes et al. (2003). The pathogen studies by Harari et al. (2005) illustrate the potential utility of simultaneous detection of IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion for monitoring immune response. Darrah et al. (2007) demonstrate that immune responses secreting IFN-γ and IL- 2 and other cytokines play a protective role in a Leishmania major infection model. The assay presented in this protocol has also been described in Boulet et al. (2007). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Remove frozen PBMCs from the liquid nitrogen tank and thaw in a 37 °C waterbath, shaking gently until the frozen aliquot is reduced to a small ice pellet. 6. Transfer cells into a 15 -mL PP tube using a plastic transfer pipette and add ~ 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium drop by drop while gently mixing the contents of the tube. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 7. Discard the supernatant by decanting, and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 8. Repeat Step 7, but remove a 30 -μL aliquot prior to centrifugation in order to count cells under the microscope. To count cells, dilute in Erythrosine B dye to check viability and use a hemacytometer. 9. After the last centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend PBMCs at 2 × 10 e 6 cells/mL in warm (37 °C) R 10 medium. Aliquot a maximum 10 e 7 (or 5 mL) cells per 50 -mL PP conical tube and incubate overnight in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 2 : Blocking Plates, Cell Plating** ***Blocking Plates (90 min) *** 10. Retrieve coated plates from the refrigerator and remove coating buffers by washing plates three times with 1 X PBS, adding 200 μL of 1 X PBS to each well with a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette.</b> *See Troubleshooting*. 11. Add 200 μL of blocking buffer and incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature. 12. Wash plates five times with 200 μL/well of 1 X PBS. Leave 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS until ready to proceed to Step 13. ***Cell Plating (2 h) *** 13. Remove 1 X PBS from ELISPOT plate and add stimuli in RPMI medium 1640 to appropriate wells in a volume of 50 μL (or 100 μL for the medium control). During this step, do not allow wells to dry. Once done, place plate in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. Stimuli are usually plated in triplicates and may include the following: - i. Medium control: 100 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. No cells are added to these wells in Step 15. - *No spots should be detected in Step 28. This controls for medium quality*. - ii. Negative control: 50 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. - *Unstimulated cells should give no or few spots in Step 28 *. - iii. Positive control: Anti-CD 3 mAb at a final well concentration of 0. 3 μg/mL. - iv. CEF control: Most individuals respond to this pool of peptides isolated from cytomegalovirus (C), Epstein-Barr virus (E), and influenza virus (F). - v. Peptides from infectious agent: Optimal peptides (8 - to 11 -mers) or 15 -mers are usually recommended. Pools of peptides may be used. Final concentration of the individual peptides or each peptide within a pool should be ~ 4 μg/mL. 14. Retrieve cells from the incubator and pool into a single 50 ‐mL PP tube. Add warm (37 °C) wash medium to fill the tube and remove a 30 -μL aliquot to count PBMCs. 15. Centrifuge cells at 1500 rpm for 7 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in warm (37 °C) R 20 medium at 4 × 10 e 6 cells per mL. Retrieve plate from the incubator and add 50 μL of cells to appropriate wells. - *Do not add cells to the “medium control” wells (Step 13. i) *. 16. Incubate plate for 28 h in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 3 : Detection (30 min) ** 17. Wash ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with 1 X PBS, 200 μL per well. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer, 200 μL per well. 18. Add 100 μL per well of detection buffer. 19. Seal plate in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight at 4 °C. **Day 4 : Spot Color Development (3. 5 h) ** 20. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well. Between each wash, empty wash fluid into a container. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. 21. Add 100 μL of developing buffer to all wells using a <b>multichannel</b> <b>pipette</b> and incubate at room temperature for at least 2 h. 22. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of PBS-T buffer, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Twice with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. - iii. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. - iv. Once with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O. 23. Add 100 μL per well of Vector Blue solution and incubate for ~ 5 min at room temperature. 24. Remove Vector Blue solution and wash the ELISPOT plates: - i. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Three times with 200 μL of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. 25. Activate AEC buffer by adding 4. 8 μL of H 2 O 2 to 10 mL of AEC buffer and filter through a 0. 45 -μm filter. Add 100 μL per well of activated AEC buffer to each well and incubate up to 5 - 10 min. 26. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O, using the VPW. - ii. One minute under running tap H 2 O. Remove the bottom of the ELISPOT plate and wash both sides of the membrane. 27. Air-dry the plates. 28. Take a picture of the wells and count spots using the CTL-Immunospot Analyzer as described by the manufacturer. If a picture of the plates cannot be taken and counted on the same day, keep the plates away from light until it can be done. - *For counting spots, sensitivity and compensation are set using wells coated with either anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coating buffer (Step 3), in which cells were stimulated with one of the positive control stimuli, i. e., CEF or anti-CD 3 mAb (Step 13). Wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer should contain only blue spots. Wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer should contain only red spots*. - i. Set sensitivity for each color separately, such that a maximum number of spots are detected in each of the anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coated wells. - ii. Using the software’s embedded algorithm, set compensation such that no blue spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer and that no red spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer. - *Using these settings, a spot that represents the footprint of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion appears purple and is detected when the color of a spot meets the threshold at the intersection of both single colors*. - iii. Count the cells in each of the three types of antigen-specific cell populations: single IFN-γ responding cells, single IL- 2 responding cells, and IFN-γ/IL- 2 dual cytokine responding cells. - iv. Always audit the counts obtained from the software well-by-well. *See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Wells leak coating buffer. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: Treatment with MeOH in Step 1 may be too long. Make sure exposure of the wells to MeOH is kept to a minimum. If the problem persists, try less concentrated MeOH solutions or replace MeOH with ethanol. - **Problem**: The positive control is weak or negative. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid using cells for which viability is < 70 % after thawing (Step 8). - 2. Avoid cell stress, such as prolonged exposure to concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), insufficient medium, insufficient CO 2, or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. - 3. Increase incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: Spot quality is poor. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Spot quality can be affected in several ways: - 1. A spot with a white center is the result of improper washing of the plate during Step 17; cells remain bound to the membrane and create a “ghost” image during development. Make sure plates are washed vigorously. - 2. Double spots or spots with a cobweb appearance result from plate displacement occurring during Step 16. Ensure plates are not moved during incubation and that the incubator is not located in an active area or near vibrating equipment (e. g., a centrifuge). - 3. Spots that are too dark with a black center make compensation with the counting instrument difficult. Reduce incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: The response to background stimuli is elevated. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid cell stress (see solution above for the positive control being weak or negative). - 2. Put cells on a shaker during Step 9 to avoid cell clumping. - 3. In wash steps using R 10 and R 20 media, screen lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to identify ones supporting low background. Some lots result in increased background and it is recommended that these be tested prior to use. If the problem persists, replace FBS with human AB serum. - 4. Check reagents for contaminants. - 5. Filtration may remove precipitated material that could cause background. ### DISCUSSION Immune monitoring methods have become essential tools for understanding the correlates of protective immune responses. The dual-color ELISPOT assay described in this protocol allows for the simultaneous detection of antigen-specific T cells secreting IFN-γ and/or IL- 2. The rationale for selecting cytokines to target in a dual-color ELISPOT assay may vary based on the experimental question being posed. IFN-γ secretion is an antiviral T cell function that is resistant to functional exhaustion in the course of infections characterized by high persistent antigen load and it is the cytokine most frequently assessed in standard ELISPOT assays used to monitor vaccine trials (Shiver et al. 2002; Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2007; Kester et al. 2008). IL- 2 secretion, on the other hand, is sensitive to functional exhaustion in a setting of high persistent antigen load. However, it tends to identify responses that are more likely to be multifunctional, i. e., have the ability to proliferate and effectively control viral replication (Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2004; Zimmerli et al. 2005). Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) is also used to characterize antigen-specific immune responses. It has the advantage of allowing for extensive phenotyping and functional analyses of the responding cells. However, ICS usually requires a greater number of PBMCs per condition tested, and it is more expensive and less amenable to high-throughput screening than the ELISPOT assay. The ELISPOT assay is at least as sensitive (if not more so) than ICS for detecting antigen-specific cells (Sun et al. 2003; Streek et al. 2009). In resource-limited settings, comprehensive screening with the dual-color ELISPOT could be used to identify specificities that could later be further phenotypically and functionally characterized by multiparametric flow cytometry. Although both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses can be detected with the dual-color ELISPOT, the use of optimal peptides or overlapping 15 -mers usually favors the detection of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells (Boulet et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). However, the ELISPOT assay also allows for the stimulation of T cells with complex antigens such as whole proteins, cell lysates, or whole or apoptotic cells. In the case of complex antigens, these would need to be pre-incubated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) (Schmittel et al. 2000). In this case, antigens would be processed by the APC and appropriately presented to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, with co-stimulatory signals, according to each cell’s specific requirements. In this context, CD 4 + T cells may be more effectively stimulated and, therefore, their responses more accurately detected. In addition, stimulation of T cells with APCs previously exposed to the antigen may favor the detection of antigen-specific cells that were not previously primed in vivo. If the dual-color ELISPOT protocol is adapted to utilize antigen-pulsed APCs as a stimulus, then the APC-priming procedure and incubation time with the responder cells should be optimized. Another caveat of this method is the decreased magnitude of IFN-γ responses, by ~ 15 %, in wells where both IL- 2 and IFN-γ are captured when compared to wells coated with IFN-γ alone (Boulet et al. 2007). This may be a consequence of the mAb-mediated sequestration of IL- 2, which is a known inducer of IFN-γ. Depending on the type of study undertaken, it is therefore necessary to determine whether the information gained from simultaneously detecting both cytokines outweighs the cost of a decreased IFN‐γ magnitude. The dual-color ELISPOT assay has been used to demonstrate the importance of the link between the predominance of different T cell functional subsets in HIV-infected individuals with different clinical outcomes or at different stages of disease (Peretz et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). ### REFERENCES 1.

Electric eel acetylcholinesterase (Type-VI-S, EC 3.1. 1.7, Sigma) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1. 1.8, Sigma) were used as the enzyme sources, while acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine chloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were employed as substrates of the reaction. 5, 5 '-Dithio-bis(2 -nitrobenzoic)acid (DTNB, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) {{was used for the}} measurement of the cholinesterase activity. All the other reagents and conditions were the same as described in our previous publication [10]. In brief, 140  μL of 0.1  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH  8.0), 20  μL of 0.2  M DTNB, 20  μL of sample solutions and 20  μL of 0.2  M acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase solution were added by <b>multichannel</b> automatic <b>pipette</b> (Gilson pipetman, France) in a 96 -well microplate and incubated for 15  min at 25  °C. The reaction was then initiated with the addition of 10  μL of 0.2  M acetylthiocholine iodide/butyrylthiocholine chloride. The hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide/butyrylthiocholine chloride was monitored by the formation of the yellow 5 -thio- 2 -nitrobenzoate anion {{as a result of the}} reaction of DTNB with thiocholines, catalyzed by enzymes at a wavelength of 412  nm utilizing a 96 -well microplate reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices, USA). Galanthamine, the anticholinesterase alkaloid-type of drug isolated from the bulbs of snowdrop (Galanthus sp.), was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and was employed as reference.|$|R
