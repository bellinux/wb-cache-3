25|$|Patients often {{respond to}} topical agents alone, such as <b>Mesalazine,</b> or {{hydrocortisone}} enemas. Again, the <b>Mesalazine</b> is preferred for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral <b>Mesalazine</b> or sulfasalazine along with topical <b>Mesalazine</b> or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral <b>Mesalazine</b> fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral <b>Mesalazine</b> doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{therapy is}} with <b>Mesalazine</b> 1g QHS or Q3HS. Those with anal {{irritation}} or discomfort from the suppositories may switch to oral medications, such as sulfasalazine, <b>Mesalazine,</b> or Colazol, {{although they are}} not as effective as suppositories for proctitis. Maintenance therapy is not recommended for those with a first episode that responded to the <b>Mesalazine.</b> Steroid foam is not shown to prevent relapse.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for active disease includes <b>Mesalazine</b> suppositories and cortisone foam (Cortifoam). <b>Mesalazine</b> 1 g SUPP QHS or Cortifoam QHS/BID is continued until remission, with response seen usually within three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Initially a 4 g <b>Mesalazine</b> enema (Rowasa) {{is given}} nightly.|$|E
25|$|If no response, {{a morning}} <b>Mesalazine,</b> or {{hydrocortisone}} enema (Cortenema) can be given.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mesalazine,</b> {{also known}} as 5-aminosalicylic acid, mesalamine, or 5-ASA. Brand names include: Asacol, Octasa, Pentasa, Salofalk, Lialda, Ipocol, Apriso, and Mezavant.|$|E
25|$|If {{still no}} response, oral {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs, {{with or without}} enemas, can be given, such as sulfasalazine, <b>Mesalazine</b> (Asacol, Pentasa), olsalazine (Dipentum), or balsalazide (Colazal).|$|E
25|$|If {{still no}} response, dose should be {{increased}} to maximum: sulfasalazine maxes at 4-6g/day, <b>Mesalazine</b> maxes at 4.8g/day, and olsalazine at 3g/day. They are usually divided tid or bid.|$|E
25|$|If oral <b>Mesalazine</b> {{is still}} not working, {{prednisone}} is often given, starting at 40–60mg/day. Prednisone often takes effect within 10–14 days. The dose should then be tapered by about 5mg/week until it can be stopped altogether.|$|E
25|$|Sulfasalazine {{has been}} a major agent in the therapy of mild to {{moderate}} ulcerative colitis for over 50 years. In 1977, Mastan S. Kalsi et al. determined that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA and <b>mesalazine)</b> was the therapeutically active component in sulfasalazine. Since then, many 5-ASA compounds have been developed with the aim of maintaining efficacy but reducing the common side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Biologic {{treatments}} {{such as the}} TNF inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab {{are commonly}} used to treat people with UC who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Tofacitinib, vedolizumab, and etrolizumab can also produce good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Usually, these medications are only used if other options have been exhausted (i.e., the person has received and not responded favorably to high-dose corticosteroids and immunomodulators such as azathioprine and <b>mesalazine).</b>|$|E
25|$|While the {{avoidance}} of nuts and seeds has historically been recommended, no association between eating these foods and diverticulitis has been found, and therefore, avoiding these foods is no longer recommended. <b>Mesalazine</b> and rifaximin appear useful for preventing attacks in those with diverticulosis. For mild diverticulitis, antibiotics by mouth and a liquid diet is recommended. For severe cases, intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and complete bowel rest may be recommended. Probiotics are of unclear use. Complications such as abscess formation, fistula formation, and perforation of the colon may require surgery.|$|E
25|$|In one double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study conducted}} in the United Kingdom, 48.6% of patients who used the nicotine patch, in conjunction with their standard treatment, showed complete resolution of symptoms. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial {{conducted in the}} United States showed that 39% of patients who used the patch showed significant improvement, versus 9% of those given a placebo. Use of a transdermal nicotine patch without the addition of other standard treatments such as <b>mesalazine</b> has relapse occurrence rates similar to standard treatment {{without the use of}} nicotine.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, <b>Mesalazine</b> or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
2500|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{action in}} all these drugs is produced by 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active ingredient in <b>Mesalazine.</b> 5-ASA is produced from the other drugs in the intestine. The aminosalicylates used to treat ulcerative colitis include the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 5-ASA compounds, such as <b>mesalazine</b> and sulfasalazine, {{have shown}} to be of very little {{efficacy}} {{in the treatment of}} Crohn's disease, either for induction or for maintenance of remission. Current guidelines do not advise the use of 5-ASA compounds in Crohn's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Boswellia is an ayurvedic (Indian {{traditional}} medicine) herb, used as {{a natural}} alternative to drugs. One study {{has found that the}} effectiveness of H-15 extract is not inferior to mesalazine: [...] "Considering both safety and efficacy of Boswellia serrata extract H15, it appears to be superior over <b>mesalazine</b> in terms of a benefit-risk-evaluation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and <b>mesalazine</b> looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and <b>mesalazine.</b> Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E
50|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence for the}} effectiveness of <b>mesalazine</b> (5-aminosalicylic acid) {{in the treatment of}} IBS. <b>Mesalazine</b> is a drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been reported to significantly reduce immune mediated inflammation in the gut of IBS affected individuals with <b>mesalazine</b> therapy resulting in improved IBS symptoms as well as feelings of general wellness in IBS affected people. It has also been observed that <b>mesalazine</b> therapy helps to normalise the gut flora which is often abnormal in people who have IBS. The therapeutic benefits of <b>mesalazine</b> {{may be the result of}} improvements to the epithelial barrier function.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{is usually}} started by {{administering}} drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone. Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, another drug {{to keep the}} disease in remission, such as <b>mesalazine</b> in UC, is the main treatment. If further treatment is required, a combination of an immunosuppressive drug (such as azathioprine) with <b>mesalazine</b> (which may also have an anti-inflammatory effect) may be needed, depending on the patient.
