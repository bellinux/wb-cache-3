50|$|Triggers are the player's {{primary means}} of {{interacting}} with the marker. The amount of force required to fire the marker, {{as well as the}} distance the trigger travels before actuating, called the throw, has a marked effect upon the player's ability to achieve high rates of fire. Many markers, especially higher priced markers, use electronic trigger frames with a variety of sensing methods, including <b>micro-switches,</b> hall effect sensors or break-beam infra-red switches. These triggers have short throws, allowing a high rate of fire. Non-electronic markers sometimes use carefully set pneumatic to achieve a light and short trigger pull.|$|R

In this paper, we report a novel material synthesized from poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) and polyethylene oxide) /nitrile butadiene rubber. The electroactive material is built as a pseudo trilayer and its lateral sides have been patterned using dry plasma etching at high etch rates and with vertical sidewalls. A chemical process and a "self-degradation" are proposed to explain such high etching rates. Preliminary actuation results show that micro-beams can move with very large displacements.

40|$|Functional {{selectivity}} is {{a property}} of G protein-coupled receptors {{that allows them}} to preferentially couple to particular signaling partners upon binding of biased agonists. Publication of the X-ray crystal structure of serotonergic 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 B receptors in complex with ergotamine, a drug capable of activating G protein coupling and b-arrestin signaling at the 5 -HT 1 B receptor but clearly favoring b-arrestin over G protein coupling at the 5 -HT 2 B subtype, has recently provided structural insight into this phenomenon. In particular, these structures highlight the importance of specific residues, also called <b>micro-switches,</b> for differential receptor activation. In our work, we apply classical molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling approaches to analyze the behavior of these <b>micro-switches</b> and their impact on the stabilization of particular receptor conformational states. Our analysis shows that differences in the conformational freedom of helix 6 between both receptors could explain their different G protein-coupling capacity. In particular, as compared to the 5 -HT 1 B receptor, helix 6 movement in the 5 -HT 2 B receptor can be constrained by two different mechanisms. On the one hand, an anchoring effect of ergotamine, which shows an increased capacity to interact with the extracellular part of helices 5 and 6 and stabilize them, hinders activation of a hydrophobic connector region {{at the center of the}} receptor. On the other hand, this connector region in an inactive conformation is further stabilized by unconserved contacts extending to the intracellular part of the 5 -HT 2 B receptor, which hamper opening of the G protein binding site. This work highlights th...|$|R
40|$|Five highly conserved polar {{residues}} {{connected by}} a number of structural water molecules together with two rotamer <b>micro-switches,</b> TrpVI: 13 and TyrVII: 20, constitute an extended hydrogen bond network between the intracellular segments of TM-I, -II, -VI, and -VII of 7 TM receptors. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that, although the fewer water molecules in rhodopsin were relatively movable, the hydrogen bond network of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor was fully loaded with water molecules that were surprisingly immobilized between the two rotamer switches, both apparently being in their closed conformation. Manipulations of the rotamer state of TyrVII: 20 and TrpVI: 13 demonstrated that these residues served as gates for the water molecules at the intracellular and extracellular ends of the hydrogen bond network, respectively. TrpVI: 13 {{at the bottom of the}} main ligand-binding pocket was shown to apparently function as a catching trap for water molecules. Mutational analysis of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor demonstrated that the highly conserved polar residues of the hydrogen bond network were all important for receptor signaling but served different functions, some dampening constitutive activity (AsnI: 18, AspII: 10, and AsnVII: 13), whereas others (AsnVII: 12 and AsnVII: 16) located one helical turn apart and sharing a water molecule were shown to be essential for agonist-induced signaling. It is concluded that the conserved water hydrogen bond network of 7 TM receptors constitutes an extended allosteric interface between the transmembrane segments being of crucial importance for receptor signaling and that part of the function of the rotamer <b>micro-switches,</b> TyrVII: 20 and TrpVI: 13, is to gate or trap the water molecules...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{required}} {{distance of the}} acting/break points in one level, transformers which are equipped with <b>micro-switches</b> have a control hysteresis in the working point which has the consequence of a restricted reproducible accuracy. Electric displacement of the working point is not possible. The other, above-mentioned transformer systems (the use of optical systems is probably limited due to design reasons) produce analogous signals {{in proportion to the}} scanning element deflection and allow thus the error-proportional weld head tracking and also the electric working point displacement through the superordinate control, e.g. in multiple layer welding. The output signals of the most commonly used inductive measuring transformer systems are between 0 and 10 V DC, depending on the scanning element deflection (Figure 2).|$|R
50|$|On {{the early}} {{electromechanical}} timers, the motor ran {{at a constant}} speed throughout the wash cycle, although {{it was possible for}} the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a <b>micro-switch</b> being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process. Fully electronic timers did not become widespread until decades later.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{calculations}} were very complicated, {{they decided to}} build a computer customized {{for the purpose of}} being fed data about the roulette wheel and the ball and to return a prediction of which of the roulette wheel's octants the ball would fall on. The computer was concealable, designed to be invisible to an onlooker. It was small enough to fit inside a shoe. The data was input by tapping the big toe on a <b>micro-switch</b> in the shoe. Then an electronic signal was relayed to a vibrotactile output system hidden behind the shirt, strapped to the chest, which had three solenoid actuators near the stomach which would indicate by vibrating either which of the eight octants of the roulette wheel to place a bet on, or a ninth possibility: not to place a bet.|$|E
50|$|In {{electromagnetic}} designs, the trigger, {{instead of}} being mechanically linked to {{the action of the}} marker, simply activates an electronic <b>micro-switch</b> (or more recently, a magnetic or optical sensor). That information is passed through control circuitry to a computer-controlled solenoid valve which can open and close very quickly and precisely, allowing gas to move into or out of various pressure chambers in the marker to move the bolt and fire the paintball. This disconnect of the trigger from the action allows electronic trigger pulls to be very short in length and very lightweight (similar to a mouse click; the mechanisms are virtually identical), which dramatically increases rate-of-fire over a fully mechanical design. Solenoid-controlled gas valve designs also allow for reduced weight of internal parts, which both lightens overall weight and reduces the time it takes for the marker to cycle through firing a single paintball.|$|E

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} lifted off the runway on the accident flight with both engines at full power, a faulty <b>micro-switch</b> {{in conjunction with}} a possible short circuit caused the right engine's thrust reverser to deploy. The imbalance of power resulted in {{the aircraft}} rolling and veering to the right as it was climbing away from the runway. The safety system automatically cut the power to the engine suffering the thrust reverser malfunction. The copilot, seeing the right engine power lever automatically move to the closed position, thought that the lever had slipped back and pushed it back to the full power position alongside the left engine throttle lever. Once again, the automatic safety system closed the right engine throttle and the captain, who was conducting the takeoff, called for the autothrottle system to be switched off. After switching off the system, the copilot again pushed the right engine power lever fully forward and forcefully held it there.|$|E
