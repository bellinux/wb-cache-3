5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated Ethyl (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by rail to Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as well. The company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for exchanging freight wagons.|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} basic directions in transport junctions? abroad {{in the second}} half of the XX century. The sorting works? concentration and structural changes in the schemes for the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> are given in the article as well. The history shows that in the postwar practice abroad much attention was paid to rational distribution of reconstructed and newly erected <b>marshalling</b> railway <b>yards.</b> In most cases for a long period the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> were developing according to private interests of railway societies. In the second half of the XX century changes in the countries? economies and in the railway operational conditions determined more rational distribution of the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in the rail network of every country. The history of science and technology testifies that when modern railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> abroad were reconstructed, they were equipped with newest technical devices providing self-routing, automatic cars? braking by means of moderators etc. The research of the sorting works? concentration and structural changes in the schemes for railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> is of extreme topicality nowadays. ? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????? ?? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?? ????. ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ???? ????????????? ??????????????? ???????. ??????? ???????????????, ??? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ???????. ? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?? ???? ?????????? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????? ?? ???? ???? ???????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ??????. ??????? ????? ? ??????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ? ???? ????????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????, ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ? ??. ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ? ? ???? ?????...|$|R

5|$|Schnaufer was {{appointed}} Gruppenkommandeur IV./NJG1 on 1 March 1944, taking over {{command of the}} Gruppe from Jabs who was given command of NJG1. He was promoted to Hauptmann on 1 May 1944. Schnaufer became an ace-in-a-day {{for the first time}} on 25 May 1944 when he claimed five RAF bombers shot down between 01:15 and 01:29 for victories 70 to 74. The bombers had targeted the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> at Aachen.|$|E
5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc overhead lines and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby. The trains took the former S line from Shildon to Simpasture Junction, joining the former Clarence Railway line to Carlton, where a later line allowed {{access to the}} Stockton to Middlesbrough extension. The locomotives operated for 20 years, but then coal traffic had reduced, which made it uneconomical to maintain the electrification system.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E

50|$|Coal trains, each {{consisting}} {{of up to}} 85 wagons, were despatched from the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> at Toton (between Nottingham and Derby), and received at Brent sidings. Here, they were split up and forwarded to the Midland Railway's own coal depots around London, and also to the London area <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> belonging to other railways.|$|R
5|$|Tibbets {{flew the}} lead bomber Butcher Shop {{for the first}} American {{daylight}} heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in Enola Gay. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, the French {{units were}} warned {{an hour before}} the German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the {{scramble}} signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground. In the end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of these machines was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain.Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow was also shot down. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|The <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> {{despite having}} been renovated in the 1960s, was partly closed after Deutsche Bundesbahn became the private Deutsche Bahn AG. Of the three humps {{originally}} {{present in the}} yard, two of them (near signal boxes Hro and Vmo) were closed. The <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> nowadays operates at only 10% of its original 10,000wagon per day capacity. The two depots and the maintenance works are also operating at reduced capacity. The mail station, which even had its own hump, has been completely closed as mail trains were abolished soon after the privatization of the former Deutsche Bundespost in the early 1990s. The access tracks have been removed and the area was sold off to investors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s a major {{modernisation}} of {{the handling of}} wagonload freight took place, when Millerhill <b>Marshalling</b> <b>Yard</b> was constructed.

This would mean that the level junction at Fürth Hauptbahnhof could be abolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} area opposite {{the station was}} the site of the South Devon Railway workshops, its engine shed being situated a little {{to the north of the}} station.

25|$|A new <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> {{was opened}} at Hackney, {{just north of}} the station, on 17 December 1911. It is a useful staging point for freight trains {{travelling}} over the steep inclines of Dartmoor on the way to Plymouth as these trains either have to be shorter or use additional locomotives compared with the flat route from Exeter.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> {{was replaced}} by a new structure further south, consisting of three hump yards. The yard serving the East-West trains (operated from signal box Hvw) {{was one of the first}} to receive a mechanised hump in 1925. Two new depots were also built near the station, Hamm P for passenger services and Hamm G for freight operations.|$|E
