40|$|A {{multi-axis}} compact positioner {{is designed}} and implemented in this thesis. The single-moving-part positioner {{is designed to}} move in the magnetic field generated by a superimposed concentrated-field permanent magnet matrix. The compact positioner is primarily for the stepping and scanning applications that require 3 -DOF planar motions. In which, the travel ranges in two orthogonal directions are on the order of 100 mm. The <b>moving</b> <b>platen,</b> which has the size of 185. 4 mm x 157. 9 mm and weighs 0. 64 kg, mainly comprises of a plastic frame and six copper coils. It is actuated in the horizontal plane by flowing six independent electric currents into the coils. The platen is supported against gravity by three air bearings. Force calculation is based on the Lorentz force law. With a current-carrying rectangular coil placed in the magnetic field of the supper-imposed Hallbach magnet matrix, the force acting on the coil is calculated by volume integration. The distances between the longer sides and between the shorter sides of the rectangular coil are designed to fit a half pitch and one pitch of the Hallbach magnet array, respectively. Therefore, the volume integration is simplified considerably. The force-current relation for the entire platen with six coils is derived. Three Hall-effect sensors are attached to the <b>moving</b> <b>platen</b> to measure the magnetic flux densities at the center points of the sensors. The position of the <b>moving</b> <b>platen</b> is determined by the field solution of the magnet matrix and the magnetic flux densities sensed by the Hall-effect sensors. A new discrete PID-like controller is proposed and tested. For the step responses with the step sizes within 1000 micrometers, the overshoots and the steady state errors are negligible. The achieved velocity in x is 10. 50 cm/s and in y is 16. 25 cm/s, respectively. The achieved acceleration in x is 43. 75 cm/s^ 2 and in y is 95. 59 cm/s^ 2, respectively. The achieved travel ranges are 15. 24 cm in x, 20. 32 cm in y, and 0. 21 rad in the rotational motions about the vertical axis. The positioning resolution in x and y is 8 micrometers with the rms positioning error of 6 micrometers. The positioning resolution in rotation about the vertical axis is 130 microrad...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) position control algorithm, using a red-green-blue (RGB) color sensor and a linearized color array. This work was implemented on a pre-existing magnetic-levitation (maglev) test bed with decoupled controllers {{for each of the}} 6 DOFs. The RGB sensor was attached horizontally onto a cantilever beam away from the <b>moving</b> <b>platen</b> and centered over a strip with varying RGB intensity values of the color red. The intensity values that make up the red strip were linearized based upon the response of the sensor as it was moved across the color strip. This linear sensor response was then used to develop a first-order curve-fit to relate position in the y-axis to the sensor output. The functionality of the control algorithm was verified through a series of step responses and continuous motion test runs. The position resolution, in the axis of movement, was demonstrated to be better than 30 ?m. Experimental results of both the position response and linearization process are presented herein...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates that}} a magnetic-levitation (maglev) stage has the capabilities to control movements and reject vibration simultaneously. The mathematical model and vibration control scheme with a 6 -degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) maglev stage for nanoscale positioning are developed for disturbance rejection. The derived full nonlinear dynamic equation of motions (EOMs) of the maglev stage include translational and rotational motions with differential kinematics. The derived EOMs and the magnetic forces are linearized {{to design a}} multivariable controller, a Linear Quadratic Gaussian with Loop Transfer Recovery (LQG/LTR), for vibration disturbance rejection in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. For a more accurate model, the dynamics of an optical table with a pneumatic passive isolation system is also considered. The model of the maglev stage with the optical table is validated by experiments. Dual-loop controllers are designed to minimize {{the influence of the}} vibration disturbance between the <b>moving</b> <b>platen</b> and the optical table in the x-, y-, and z-axes motions. The inner-loop compensator regulates the velocity to reject vibration disturbance and the outer-loop compensator tracks positioning commands. When the vibration disturbances of 10 to 100 Hz are applied, the vibration-reduction ratios are about 30 to 65 percent in horizontal motion and 20 to 45 percent in vertical motion. In addition, the vibration disturbances of 45. 45 Hz are attenuated by about 4 to 40 percent in angular motions. The vibration control schemes are effective in not only translational but rotational motions. In step responses, the vibration control schemes reduce the wandering range in the travel from the origin to another location. Positioning and tracking accuracies with the vibration controller are better than those without the vibration controller. In summary, these dual-loop control schemes with velocity feedback control improved the nanopositioning and vibration/disturbance rejection capabilities of a maglev system...|$|E
5000|$|The Heavy Press Program {{was under}} the {{direction}} of the US Air Force for installation at two locations because, from a strategic standpoint two locations were needed; Alcoa Cleveland, OH and Wyman Gordon, North Grafton, MA. The two Press Builders were Loewy Hydropress Inc. (Loewy) and Mesta Machine. At Loewy, Zietlin was involved the design and construction of the 35,000 ton press code named [...] "MINOR" [...] and the 50,000 ton code named [...] "MAJOR" [...] forging presses at that time were owned by the US Air Force and installed at Wyman Gordon in North Grafton, Massachusetts, in the early 50's. This program was part of the buildup that was deemed as necessary due what the press technology Germany had developed in World War II and the following subsequent Cold War Soviet threat. There were two other [...] "Minor" [...] and [...] "Major" [...] hydraulic presses and were built by Mesta Machine and were commissioned at Alcoa Cleveland, Ohio, during the same period. Both had the same 50,000-ton forge capacity and were powered by huge High Pressure Water Hydraulic systems with forging flows of 12,000 Gallons per Minute (45,000 Liters/min.) at 4,500 (PSI 310 bar) and even today, with technological advances and all things considered, many heavy forging system engineers still consider a Water Hydraulic System. The Loewy and Mesta press frame designs were quite different, Loewy Presses were a pull down design using columnar plate design as compared to the Mesta design with <b>moving</b> <b>platens</b> with round columns. Both the 50,000-ton presses are listed as National Historic Engineering Landmarks.|$|R

The type of strand mat E-glass reinforced polyester resin {{was conducted in}} this study. The specimens of square pultruded and thin-walled wrapped strand mat E-glass composite were compressed under quasi-static of obliquely loadings from the top <b>moving</b> plat <b>platen.</b> For each specimen of composite tubes, triggering mechanism was applied on frontal end top of the tube to obtain the progressive failure throughout the crash event. The pultruded profile tube wall-thicknesses of 2. 1 mm and thin-walled aluminum 1. 9 mm thickness wrapped 3 layer woven fabric were examined, {{and the effects of}} crushing behaviors and failure modes were discussed. Results showed that the tubeâ€™s energy absorption capability was affected significantly by different type of composite made in term of internal energy...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the plastic shear response during static friction of an asperity protruding {{from a large}} FCC single crystal. The asperity is in perfectly adhesive contact with a rigid platen and is sheared by tangentially <b>moving</b> the <b>platen.</b> Using discrete dislocation plasticity simulations, we elucidate the plastic shear behaviour of single asperities of various size and shape, in search for the length scale that controls the plastic behaviour. Since plasticity can occur also in the crystal, identification of the length scale that controls a possible size-dependent plastic behaviour {{is far from being}} trivial. It is found that scaling down the dimensions of an asperity results in a higher contact shear strength. The contact area is dominant in controlling the plastic shear response, because it determines the size of the zone, in and below the asperity, where dislocation nucleation can occur. For a specific contact area, there is still a dependence on asperity volume and shape, but this is weaker than the dependence on contact area alone...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, control, {{and implementation of}} a compact highprecision multidimensional positioner. This precision-positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single-moving part that carries three 3 -phase permanent-magnet planar-levitation-motor armatures. Since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and coarse motions, this positioning system is reliable and potentially cost-effective. The three planar levitation motors based on the Lorentz-force law not only produce the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but also control the platen's position and orientation in the horizontal plane. Three laser distance sensors are used to measure vertical, x-, and yrotation motions. Three 2 -axis Hall-effect sensors are used to determine lateral motions and rotation motion about the z-axis by measuring the magnetic flux density generated by the magnet matrix. This positioning system has a total mass of 1. 52 kg, which is the minimized mass to produce better dynamic performance. In {{order to reduce the}} mass of the <b>moving</b> <b>platen,</b> it is made of Delrin with a mass density of 1. 54 g/cm 3 by Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining. The platen can be regarded a pure mass, and the spring and damping effects are neglected except for the vertical dynamic. Single-input single-output (SISO) digital lead-lag controllers and a multivariable Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller were designed and implemented. Real-time control was performed with the Linux-Ubuntu operating system OS. Real Time Application Interface (RTAI) for Linux works with Comedi and Comedi libraries and enables closed-loop real-time control. One of the key advantages of this positioning stage with Hall-effect sensors is the extended travel range and rotation angle in the horizontal mode. The maximum travel ranges of 220 mm in x and 200 mm in y were achieved experimentally. Since the magnet matrix generates periodical sinusoidal flux densities in the x-y plane, the travel range can be extended by increasing the number of magnet pitches. The rotation angle of 12 degrees was achieved in rotation around z. The angular velocities of 0. 2094 rad/s and 4. 74 rad/s were produced by a 200 -mm-diameter circular motion and a 30 -mm-diameter spiral motion, respectively. The maximum velocity of 16. 25 mm/s was acquired from over one pitch motion. The maximum velocity of 17. 5 mm/s in a 8 -mm scanning motion was achieved with the acceleration of 72. 4 m/s 2. Step responses demonstrated a 10 -um resolution and 6 -um rms position noise in the translational mode. For the vertical mode, step responses of 5 um in z, 0. 001 degrees in roation around x, and 0. 001 degrees in rotation around y were achieved. This compact single-moving-part positioner has potential applications for precisionpositioning systems in semiconductor- manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} electromagnetic design and experimental validation {{of a new}} framework for linear permanent-magnet (PM) machines with targeted applications in precision motion control. In this framework, a single forcer, which can generate two independent force components in two perpendicular directions, consists of a stationary Halbach magnet array and two Lorentz coils with a phase difference of 90 ? or 270 ?. Any number of coil pairs can be attached on the same moving frame {{to work with a}} common magnet array or matrix, forming a linear or planar PM motor. Key advantages of this framework are simple force calculation, a linear system model, and a reduced number of coils for force generation and allocation in multi-axis positioners. The proposed framework effectively allows for decoupled dynamics, simplifying the linear controller design and real-time implementation. To experimentally verify the theoretical framework proposed herein, a high-precision 6 -axis magnetically levitated (maglev) stage is designed, constructed, and controlled. The development of this 6 -axis positioning system is an integrated work, including magnetic-force calculation and analysis, mechanical design, fabrication, assembly, system modeling, system identification, and control system design. The mechanical components of the system include a stationary superimposed Halbach magnet matrix, which was previously built, and a <b>moving</b> <b>platen</b> with a plastic frame, four sets of 2 -phase coils, and two precision mirrors. For position measurements, there are three laser interferometers for in-plane position measurements, three laser displacement sensors for out-of-plane position sensing, and two 2 -channel Hall-effect sensors for the position feedback to initialize the position and expand the travel ranges of the platen in the XY plane. The positioning resolutions of 10 nm in the xy plane and in the vertical axis are demonstrated. In out-of-plane rotation about the two horizontal axes, experimental results show the unprecedented positioning resolution of 0. 1 ?rad. The maximum travel range in X and Y with nanoscale positioning resolution is 56 mm ? 35 mm, limited by the lengths of the precision mirrors attached to the platen. With the trapezoidal-velocity input shaping, achieved performance specifications include the maximum acceleration and velocity of 0. 6 m/s 2 and 0. 06 m/s, respectively, in translations in the horizontal plane. With the platen supported by the air bearings, the maximum acceleration and speed are 1. 5 m/s 2 and 0. 15 m/s, respectively. A load test is performed with the platen carrying a load of 0. 54 kg, which is 72 % of its total mass, magnetically levitated in 6 - axis closed-loop control. Experimental results show the reduced coupled dynamics between different axes in magnetic levitation. This framework of 2 -phase Lorentz coils and linear Halbach arrays is highly applicable in precision-positioning linear motors and multi-axis stages, steppers, scanners, nano-scale manipulation and alignment systems, and vibration isolators...|$|E
