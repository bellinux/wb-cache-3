5|$|The green rosella {{generally}} breeds at {{two years}} of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1m (3ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30m (100ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech.</b> Chimneys, holes in walls and even the vertical pipes of tennis court fences have been used. Green rosellas nested in a wall cavity at Port Arthur convict prison site in 1958 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizas form between fungi and {{the roots}} of around 2% of plant species. These tend to be {{composed}} of woody plants, including species from the birch, dipterocarp, <b>myrtle,</b> <b>beech,</b> willow, pine and rose families.|$|E

50|$|The Varnum School {{building}} {{is set on}} the south side of Sixth Street, between <b>Myrtle</b> and <b>Beech</b> Streets in the city's Centralville neighborhood, located just across the Merrimack River from its central business district. It is a three-story brick structure, with two large sections joined by a smaller one. The section facing the street is a Classical Revival structure, three stories high, with a hip roof and a projecting gable-roofed center section. Its corners are articulated by brick pilasters with stone capitals, and its windows have granite sills and lintels. The third-floor windows are round-arched, while the others are regular sash. The cornice and the pedimented gable are modillioned. This section was built in 1896 to a design by Arthur M. Burtt.|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, <b>myrtle</b> and excellent <b>beech</b> trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} species of Nothofagus in Australia. Stands of <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus cunninghamii) {{exist in the}} Tarkine Forest. There are also stands of this species in the Great Otway National Park, the Central Highlands, the Strzelecki Ranges and Wilsons Promontory National Park, of Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Chalciporus piperatus {{grows in}} conifer {{plantations}} {{associated with the}} fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) and the chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius). It has been recorded under introduced loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in Santa Catarina and Paraná states in southern Brazil, and under introduced trees in the Los Lagos Region of Chile. It has also spread into native forest in northeastern Tasmania and Victoria, having been found growing with the native <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The rare variety hypochryseus occurs only in Europe, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Also rare, variety amarellus is widespread in European coniferous forests, where it usually found near pines, spruce, and sometimes fir.|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{population}} of Lomatia tasmanica consists of around 300 plants in an area less than 1.2 km long in southwestern Tasmania. The climate is wet, receiving 1700 mm of rain a year, and all plants grow within 25 m of a river or creek. It mainly grows in a rainforest or mixed forest made up of trees 8–15 m high and such species as <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> Lophozonia cunninghamii, celery-top pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida), satinwood (Nematolepis squamea), blue-green tea tree (Leptospermum glaucescens) and (Anodopetalum biglandulosum), and understory species such as thyme archeria ( [...] Archeria serpyllifolia), native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida), sweet-scented trochocarpa (Trochocarpa gunnii), Raukaua gunnii, white waratah (Agastachys odorata) and Prionotes cerinthoides, hard water fern (Blechnum wattsii) and brickmaker's sedge ( [...] Gahnia grandis). Scattered Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida) tower over the canopy. Profuse moss and fern growth highlights the wetness of the habitat. Lomatia tasmanica extends into neighbouring dry sclerophyll forest composed of Smithton peppermint over an understory of blue-green tea tree on more elevated areas. Finally, it grows in a dense riverbank scrubland with species such as silver banksia (Banksia marginata), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), prickly-leaved wattle (Acacia verticillata), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), scented paperbark (M. squarrosa), Anodopetalum biglandulosum and Smithton peppermint over a dense low understory of Bauera rubioides, Gahnia grandis, Epacris aff. heteronema, scrambling coral fern (Gleichenia microphylla), Calorophus erostris, lesser wire rush (Empodisma minus) and button grass (Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus).|$|E

50|$|<b>Myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> forests cannot survive strong fire, {{and must}} re-establish from {{neighbouring}} areas. They can, however, survive light fires, by regenerating from seed, or sometimes vegetatively from basal epicormic shoots. Generally <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> forests only form once a wet sclerophyll forest reaches maturity, taking {{several hundred years}} to do so.|$|E

50|$|Odd-clawed spiders are {{endemic to}} the Great Otway National Park of Victoria, Australia. They seem to prefer {{to build their}} webs near or in the hollows of <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus cunninghamii), {{particularly}} in very old trees which usually have extensive hollows. Webs have also been found near hollows in mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the bases of tree ferns (Cyatheales), and even under bridges. Though in areas where old myrtle trees are abundant, these other habitats are much less inhabited. This may indicate that they are dependent on the microclimate of the <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> hollows.|$|E
50|$|Cyttaria gunnii, {{commonly}} known as the myrtle orange or beech orange, is an orange-white coloured and edible ascomycete fungus native to Australasia. It is a specific parasite of <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus cunninghamii) trees.|$|E
50|$|Within the genus, {{it is part}} of a {{lineage of}} three {{evergreen}} species, the other two being silver beech (L. menziesii) of New Zealand and <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (L. cunninghamii) of Tasmania and Victoria.|$|E
50|$|The East Victorian Central Highlands, {{including}} Melbourne's forested water catchments, contain cool temperate rainforests; {{dominated by}} <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> and southern sassafras, with an understorey of ferns and mosses. They may also contain eucalypt trees and blackwood.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} undescribed {{species in the}} forests of <b>Myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus cunninghamii) in Tasmania. Bruce Fuhrer noticed in 1992 that the large and ornamented spores of these species resembled those of the genera Ramaria and Beenakia.|$|E
50|$|Myrtle wilt, a {{parasitic}} fungus, attacks <b>myrtle</b> <b>beech</b> {{when the}} air-borne spores settle on open wounds. It {{is a natural}} disease of L. cunninghamii, {{but in recent years}} it has become a serious problem due to poor logging practices.|$|E
