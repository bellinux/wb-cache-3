50|$|A <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof</b> {{can also}} be a smaller {{addition}} to an existing roof, where keeping to the same slope (roof pitch) puts the <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof</b> lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have a sloping, or raked, ceiling line to maximise the ceiling height. The name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.|$|E

50|$|A <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof</b> is a single-sloping roof surface, {{often not}} {{attached}} to another roof surface. Mono-pitched roofs are {{also known as}} a pent roof, shed roof, lean-to roof, or skillion roof (in Australia). This is in contrast to a dual-pitched roof, {{also known as a}} gabled roof, which is pitched in two different directions.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{purpose-built}} doocots in Scotland {{are of a}} [...] "beehive" [...] shape, circular in {{plan and}} tapering up to a domed roof with a circular opening at the top. In the late 16th century, they were superseded by the [...] "lectern" [...] type, rectangular with a <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof</b> sloping fairly steeply in a suitable direction. Phantassie Doocot is an unusual example of the beehive type topped with a <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> and Finavon Doocot of the lectern type is the largest doocot in Scotland, with 2,400 nesting boxes. Doocots were built well into the 18th century in increasingly decorative forms, then the need for them died out though some continued to be incorporated into farm buildings as ornamental features. However, the 20th century saw a revival of doocot construction by pigeon fanciers, and dramatic towers clad in black or green painted corrugated iron can still be found on wasteland near housing estates in Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|E

50|$|Before 1890, {{the most}} houses in Moldavanka District were built with mono-pitched roofs (shed roofs) due to local natural {{conditions}} and circumstances required it. The closest big river Dniester ran far from Odessa, about 50 kilometers. Some small streams and springs inside Odessa city and Moldavanka {{were used by}} inhabitants {{and it was not}} enough during the hot and dry season in July and August. This circumstance limited the population of the city also and the city did not expand. It stayed inside of it's city limits until the 20th century. Until the 1890's, when the water supply system was constructed for the city, the population had to collect rain water in drums, underground cisterns or other vials during the rain season to use collected water during the dry season. It is why any <b>mono-pitched</b> <b>roof</b> of Odessa house have a slope, which directed inside the courtyard. Due to in Odessa region winter snow was rare, stayed not long time and quickly melted, the mono-pitched roofs were available in this region as the small quantity of snow has not destroy this type roof. This type of roof permitted the collection of rain water {{from one side of the}} house, and it was better than using a gable roof.|$|E
