40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} nature and {{evolution}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>crime</b> in the West African region, asking questions around what contemporary maritime piracy in Nigeria (and by extension the Gulf of Guinea) has come to look like, and how it compares to similar activities in other domains. The study uses a mixed methods approach, employing desktop research, visiting research, interviewbased research, and data collection and analysis. The research reveals Nigeria {{to be at the}} epicentre of the maritime criminal problem over the period under review, which developed alongside the exploitation of oil in that country. The data allows for the establishment of modus operandi {{and the development of a}} typology of <b>maritime</b> <b>crime,</b> which reveals five main categories of attack. Further to this, it is also able to establish some linkage between theft of oil and petroleum products at sea, colloquially known as petro-piracy, and the oil bunkering that takes place on land. However, contrary to popular belief, the data does not bear out the presumption that petro-piracy forms the central thrust of the model at play in this domain. Noting Nigeria to be the origin and source of a problem that then spills over into neighbouring waters, the study then homes in on this country in order to establish the motivating factors that explain the emergence and persistence of this criminal activity. The researcher narrows causal factors down to the following: state weakness and ungoverned spaces, poverty and inequality, corruption and neopatrimonialism, environmental degradation, criminality meeting protest, and a culture of violence. The study has also examined the extent of counter-piracy in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) subregion, following initiatives across domestic, regional, and international levels.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the interdiction of {{trafficking}} in illicit drugs at sea as {{one part of the}} general problem of illicit drug trafficking. More specifically, the study {{focuses on the}} legal framework for the interdiction of illicit maritime drug trafficking under international law. Firstly, the general legal framework of international law has been examined, followed by an examination of the specific legal framework for maritime drug interdiction. Some attention is given {{to the question of how}} practice of states in that area of activity have contributed to the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the legal framework. Another issue is whether or not that practice has contributed to the formation of customary international law. For the research the point of view is that of a coastal state and the point of view of an intervening state. The research has concentrated on the legal framework of public international law, including the law of the sea, for maritime drug interdiction. This study is concerned with the international law of the sea - that is to say, with rules that bind states in their international relations concerning maritime matters. More specifically, the study is concerned with rules that bind states in interdicting illicit drug trafficking at sea. Maritime drug-interdiction treaties may provide legal bases to national law in order to address drug-related offences. This study does not discuss, except incidentally, national law relating to the conduct at sea. Nonetheless, this leaves a considerable body of law, mainly provisions found in treaties and customary international law, within the purview of this study. Illicit drug trafficking at sea forms part of a larger complex of criminal operations. Present forms of <b>maritime</b> <b>crimes</b> (in a broad definition of the term) can be divided into two categories. One category concerns activities directly linked to the sea and occur there, such as piracy or illegal fishing. The other category concerns activities that form a part of a larger complex of criminal operations, which mainly take place on land, for example smuggling migrants or the illegal transport of wastes. Trafficking in illicit drugs belongs to this second category. The sea is the area par excellence where international law establishes the conditions for states to exercise their jurisdiction. Although, in principle, states have complete jurisdiction within their own territory, at sea this jurisdiction is clearly defined and limited by international law. Rules of customary international law have been applicable to the uses of the ocean for hundreds of years. It is in that context that maritime drug interdiction has been studied...|$|R

State failure, anarchy and a lack of infrastructure are not conducive for the establishment of any business. This includes illegal businesses, as criminals need protection and markets to convert loot into consumables. At the bottom end of the spectrum, therefore, both legal business and criminal gangs benefit from improved governance, especially when this is delivered informally. With significant improvements in formal governance criminal activities decline. We use data from the International Maritime Bureau to create a new dataset on piracy and find strong and consistent support for this non-linear relationship. The occurrence, persistence and intensity of small-scale <b>maritime</b> <b>crime</b> are well approximated by a quadratic relationship with governance quality. Organised crime benefits from corrupt yet effective bureaucrats, and informally governed areas within countries. ...|$|E

40|$|Participants and {{observers}} of the maritime industry have been claiming a trend internationally towards criminalising the actions of seafarers in modern years. This trend has been apparent since the mid- 20 th century and has many vocal industry participants declaring that it is disturbing and negatively impacts the maritime industry as a whole, particularly when the blame of large-scale pollution events are placed on seafarers themselves. The International Transport Workers’ Federation (“ITWF”) highlights these industry concerns:¹ "In the modern maritime industry, reduced crews are expected to affect fast turnarounds and take ever greater responsibility for maritime security and pollution prevention. On the one hand {{they are subject to}} pressure from the company to remain economically competitive at all costs. On the other hand they face the threat of heavy-handed sanctions by States eager to find scapegoats for politically sensitive cases involving environmental damage. " This paper looks at international discourse on this trend and examines whether it is reflected in New Zealand (“NZ”) by focusing on the statutory reality of the increasing criminalisation thesis. This maritime industry is largely regulated by the Maritime Transport Act 1994 (“MTA”). However, as with all jurisdictions, maritime specific laws do not exist in a vacuum. The MTA operates alongside <b>maritime</b> rules; the <b>Crimes</b> Act 1961; the Resource Management Act 1991 (“RMA”); anti-terrorism measures; health and safety legislation; employee rights; human rights; and international obligations. This research paper analyses the NZ dimension {{in the context of this}} international discussion. This paper has four main aims: 1) To isolate the areas where industry participants believe there is a trend towards greater criminalisation; 2) To analyse legislative and policy developments in NZ, focusing on the MTA and earlier legislation; 3) Determine whether NZ is following the international trend towards increased criminalisation of seafarers; and 4) Highlight infamous cases giving rise to liability in this area and hypothetically applies them to the NZ context. The bulk of this paper focuses on the second aim above: Part IV identifies five areas of criminal responsibility. Every <b>maritime</b> offence and <b>crime</b> in NZ legislation has been examined. ² Part V is a forecasting exercise where I apply the facts of four international cases into the NZ framework and examine a ‘worse case’ scenario. This paper focuses on offences applicable only to seafarers (including masters) of merchant ships, in the course of their professional duties. There are sundry offences in NZ law which apply to “every person” but this paper only examines these in the context of seafarers’ professional duties. For example, offences under the recent legislation to combat piracy and terrorism through policing and border control – <b>Maritime</b> <b>Crimes</b> Act 1999 and Maritime Security Act 2004 – are outside the scope of this paper though both Acts are important pieces of legislation for NZ international obligations. ³ I do not examine offences relating to harbour-masters; owners or employers of seafarers; warships or defence force members; port operators or facilities; pleasure craft; fishing boats; search and rescue operators; wrecks; nor marine structures and operations. ⁴ Further, the paper does not look at the civil penalties for the same activities as examined in the criminal context, liability under the Maritime Insurance Act 1908, or the delegated authority of Maritime New Zealand (“MNZ”). ⁵ This scope has been chosen due to the parallel international discussion and concerns with this subject. ¹ International Transport Workers’ Federation “Out of sight, out of mind: Seafarers, Fishers and Human Rights” June 2006 at 29. Challengers assert is that the “criminalisation of accidental pollution may discourage feedback regarding incidents, failures, and even accidents and so inhibit their prevention” as well as the increasingly employment costs that such criminal sanctions trigger: see Kyriaki Mitroussi “Employment of seafarers in the EU context: Challenges and opportunities” (2008) 32 Marine Policy at 1047. ² For ease of discussion, Part IV divides these areas into (1) health and safety offences (including pollution and hazardous cargo situations); (2) emergency situations, collisions or accidents; (3) employment rights and obligations; (4) financial and regulatory responsibilities; and (5) obligations involving the administration of justice. ³ See International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1184 UNTS 1185 (opened for signature 1 November 1974, entered into force 25 May 1980). ⁴ See sections 31 (4) and 71 (1) of the Maritime Transport Act 1994 [hereinafter referred to as the “MTA”]; Maritime New Zealand v Page [2013] DCR 102; and Sellers v Maritime Safety (5 November 1998) CA 104 / 98. ⁵ See Part 25 of the MTA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the expansion of}} private maritime security provision, its regulation and implications for national and global security. The main research question addressed is: How are private maritime security companies (PMSCs) regulated {{in the context of}} the contemporary trend towards international security privatisation? However, further questions stem from this: Is the complex framework of the PMSCs’ business model adequately regulated? To what extent could the existing practices and regulatory framework affect international security in governance and policy, strategic, social and commercial terms? Qualitative research methods were used, strongly supported by empirical data collection – available due to extensive professional experience and personal engagement of the author with the private maritime security industry. Using a case study of PMSCs’ operations off Somalia from 2005 - 2013, and a plethora of selected data from primary sources and semi-structured interviews, the paper argues that there is need for more effective regulation of PMSCs and the establishment of international standards. Following an analysis of the current conceptual framework of private security, focussing particularly on maritime security, in the context of contemporary academic literature and professional practice, the paper provides a detailed theoretical justification for the selection of the methodology used. After broadening and deepening the analysis of the privatisation of security ashore, the concerns raised are then transferred to the maritime domain. The situation becomes even more complicated in the high seas due to inconsistencies between flag states’ regulations, the unregulated vastness of the oceans and the reluctance of any international body (such as the IMO) to undertake the essential task of regulating PMSCs. Building on this, an analytical framework that enables the integration of maritime security and contemporary piracy into the contemporary paradigm of global security is developed. An historical overview of piracy then demonstrates that modern piracy is an ancient phenomenon with contemporary local characteristics. The <b>maritime</b> <b>crime’s</b> causal factors remain more or less the same throughout human history and, the paper argues, PMSCs serve as a short term response to address the symptoms rather than the root causes. Given that PMSCs have so far been used primarily as measures against Somali piracy, activities in this specific region provide an appropriate case study. The development of a typology of piracy offers a deeper understanding of the regional distinctiveness of the phenomenon, which is essential to acquiring a holistic picture of the operational environment in which PMSCs are deployed. The above considerations are used as a basis for analysing the complexities of the PMSCs’ business model, in legal, operational and ethical terms. The questionable practices involved in these are not fully regulated by national states. Hence, their contract and deployment raise ethical, legal and operational concerns. In the penultimate chapter, these are further assessed in terms of the extent to which the existing regulatory framework and PMSCs’ practices affect international security in governance and policy, strategic, social and commercial terms. The research indicates that states are increasingly outsourcing the monopoly they have exercised in security provision - a trend that has also expanded the private sector’s activities and business at sea. However, the lack of international laws and the consequent unstandardized plethora of flag states’ regulations has meant that the burgeoning private security services are dependent on the global market to regulate themselves. States’ reluctance and/or inability to regulate these companies has allowed controversial practices to persist and the lack of an international body responsible for their regulation and vetting on a worldwide basis has inevitable consequences in terms of global security. The overall outcome of this thesis is an elucidation of the potential implications of the privatisation of maritime security - both positive and negative. Most significantly, it suggests this could present a significant threat to international security in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (published in 1883) is {{the most}} famous pirate novel ever written that forever changed our modern {{perceptions}} of piracy.

In this essay, I document that the occurrence of this great wave of piracy was primarily due to the unprecedented growth of European trade with China around 1550 being impeded by Ming China’s prohibition on private foreign trade (the sea ban). After the sea ban was lifted in 1567, piracy plummeted and was replaced by the rapid development of private foreign trade. My findings indicate that piracy was promoted mainly by economic incentives resulting from disequilibrium between supply and demand in the maritime market, and highlight the importance of trade liberalization in reducing <b>maritime</b> <b>crime.</b> Essay Two Can State Ideology Reduce Civil Conflict? Confucianism and Peasant Rebellion in Qing China This essay examines the role of Confucianism—the state orthodoxy that has inculcated morality and social harmony for several millennia in imperial China—in mitigating the impact of crop failure on the incidence of peasant rebellions. Drawing upon county-level data from the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1911), and exploiting exogenous variations in the distance to Confucius’ birthplace as the instrumental variable for the strength of Confucianism, my findings indicate that the positive link between crop failure and peasant rebellions could not be alleviated by the Confucian ethos.

40|$|Jurisdiction for the {{prosecution}} and investigation of crimes at sea The criminal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, States and Territories in the maritime areas surrounding Australia is often a cause of uncertainty. This summary describes how the Commonwealth and the States have defined their jurisdiction and law enforcement responsibilities for the criminal laws that apply around Australia’s coastline. The primary legislation governing general <b>maritime</b> <b>crime</b> is the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 (Cth) (‘CASA’). CASA performs two important functions: • it gives effect to a Cooperative Scheme between the Commonwealth and the States, which defines {{the application of the}} criminal law in the areas adjacent to the coast of Australia (generally within 200 nautical miles (nm)) and • it sets out situations where Australian criminal laws can apply to criminal acts on Australian and foreign vessels outside of those adjacent areas. CASA recognises that additional considerations apply to conduct on or from foreign flagged ships. Under international law, ships are normally subject to the criminal jurisdiction of their state of registration (flag state). Because of this principle, even where particular conduct is subject to Australian law (for example because a foreign vessel is located close to the Australian coastline), the flag state of the foreign vessel may also have jurisdiction over that conduct. The Attorney General’s consent is required before commencing a prosecution for conduct occurring on a foreign vessel. The Cooperative Scheme The preamble to CASA describes how the Act and the Scheme function: • each State is allocated an ‘adjacent area ’ alongside its coastline • the ‘substantive criminal law of a State ’ applies in each adjacent area, by the force of the law of the State, up to a distance of 12 nm • from 12 nm to 200 nm (or {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf if it is further than 200 nm from a State) the criminal laws of the State are applied in the adjacent area by the Commonwealth (through CASA).
