5000|$|Stink badgers (Mydaus) are {{not true}} badgers but a genus of the skunk family of carnivorans, the <b>Mephitidae.</b> There are only two extant species - the Palawan stink badger (M. marchei), and the Sunda stink badger or Teledu (M. javanensis). They live only on western islands of the Malay Archipelago: Sumatra, Java, Borneo and (in {{the case of the}} Palawan stink badger) on the Philippine island of Palawan; as well as many other, smaller islands in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Stink badgers were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} be related to true badgers in the (subfamily Melinae) of the weasel family of carnivores, the Mustelidae, but recent DNA analysis so strongly suggests they share a more recent common ancestor with skunks that experts have now placed them in the skunk family of carnivores, the <b>Mephitidae.</b> [...] The two existing species are different enough from each other for the Palawan stink badger to be sometimes classified in its own genus, Suillotaxus.|$|E
50|$|Family <b>Mephitidae</b> (skunks and stink badgers) {{was once}} {{classified}} as mustelids, but are now {{recognized as a}} lineage in their own right. The 12 species of skunks are divided into four genera: Mephitis (hooded and striped skunks, two species), Spilogale (spotted skunks, four species), Mydaus (stink badgers, two species) and Conepatus (hog-nosed skunks, four species). The two skunk species in the Mydaus genus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines; all other skunks inhabit the Americas from Canada to central South America.|$|E
50|$|Badgers are short-legged omnivores in {{the family}} Mustelidae, which also {{includes}} the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family <b>Mephitidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|The skunks were {{formerly}} {{included as}} a subfamily of the mustelids, but are now regarded as a separate family (the <b>Mephitidae).</b> The mongoose and the meerkat bear {{a striking resemblance to}} many mustelids, but belong to a distinctly different suborder—the Feliformia (all those carnivores sharing more recent origins with the cats) and not the Caniformia (those sharing more recent origins with the dogs). Because the mongooses and the mustelids occupy similar ecological niches, convergent evolution has led to some similarity in form and behavior.|$|E
50|$|Veterinary {{understanding}} of skunks is rather limited, since scientists have not conducted as much research on skunks {{as they have}} on more common pets. Skunks do not always respond to medicines {{the same way as}} cats or dogs. As a result, there is considerable disagreement about how best to treat them. Some veterinarians say they are related to hamsters and treat them as such. However, hamsters are from the Rodent order while Skunks are in the family <b>Mephitidae</b> of the order Carnivora. This is the same order as cats, dogs, and ferrets.|$|E
50|$|Although {{smaller than}} true badgers, the Palawan stink badger {{is one of}} the larger members of the skunk family, the <b>Mephitidae.</b> Adults measure 32 to 46 cm in length, about {{the same size as the}} striped skunk native to North America, and weigh {{anything}} from 0.85 to 2.5 kg. In physical appearance, however, they more closely resemble badgers than skunks. They have a pointed snout with a mobile nose, and a stocky body with short and powerful limbs bearing sharply recurved claws. The tail is very short in comparison to the body, measuring only 1.5 to 4.5 cm, and lacking the bushy fur of many skunks. The ears are almost invisible, with only vestigial pinnae, and the eyes are also relatively small.|$|E

5000|$|The Palawan stink badger (Mydaus marchei), or pantot, is a carnivoran of {{the western}} Philippines named for its {{resemblance}} to badgers, its powerful smell, and the largest island {{to which it is}} native, Palawan. Like all stink badgers, the Palawan stink badger was once thought to share a more recent common ancestor with badgers than with skunks. Recent genetic evidence, however, has led to their re-classification as one of the <b>Mephitidae,</b> the skunk family of mammals. [...] It {{is the size of a}} large skunk or small badger, and uses its badger-like body to dig by night for invertebrates in open areas near patches of brush. While it lacks the whitish dorsal patches typical of its closest relatives, predators and hunters generally avoid the powerful noxious chemicals it can spray from the specialized anal glands characteristic of mephitids.|$|E
50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), <b>Mephitidae</b> (skunks and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), Procyonidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), Ailuridae (red panda), Otariidae (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and Phocidae (earless seals) (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|E
50|$|Carnivora are {{generally}} divided into the suborders Feliformia (cat-like) and Caniformia (dog-like), {{the latter of}} which includes the pinnipeds. The pinnipeds {{are part of a}} clade, known as the Arctoidea, which also includes the Ursidae (bears) and the superfamily Musteloidea. The Musteloidea in turn consists of the Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons), <b>Mephitidae</b> (skunks) and Ailurus (red panda). The oldest caniforms are the Miacis species Miacis cognitus, the Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) such as Daphoenus, and Hesperocyon (of the family Canidae, subfamily Hesperocyoninae). Hesperocyonine canids first appeared in North America, and the earliest species is currently dated at 39.74 mya, but they were not represented in Europe until well into the Miocene, and not into Asia and Africa until the Pliocene. Miacis and Amphicyonidae were the first of the caniforms to split from the others and are sometimes considered to be sister groups to Ursidae, but the exact closeness of Amphicyonidae and Ursidae, as well as Arctoidae to Ursidae, is still uncertain. The Canidae (wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes and dogs) {{are generally}} considered to be the sister group to Arctoidea. The Ursidae first occur in North America in the Late Eocene (ca. 38 mya) as the very small and graceful Parictis that had a skull only 7 cm long. Like the canids, this family does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. The other caniform families Amphicyonidae, Mustelidae and Procyonidae occur in both the Old World and the New World by the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene.|$|E

40|$|Extant {{members of}} the order Carnivora split into two basal groups, Caniformia (dog-like carnivorans) and Feliformia (cat-like carnivorans). In this study we address phylogenetic {{relationships}} within Caniformia applying various methodological approaches to analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes. Pinnipeds are currently well represented with respect to mitogenomic data and here we add seven mt genomes to the non-pinniped caniform collection. The analyses identified a basal caniform divergence between Cynoidea and Arctoidea. Arctoidea split into three primary groups, Ursidae (including the giant panda), Pinnipedia, and a branch, Musteloidea, which encompassed Ailuridae (red panda), <b>Mephitidae</b> (skunks), Procyonidae (raccoons) and Mustelidae (mustelids). The analyses favored a basal arctoid split between Ursidae and a branch containing Pinnipedia and Musteloidea. Within the Musteloidea there was a preference for a basal divergence between Ailuridae and remaining families. Among the latter, the analyses identified a sister group relationship between <b>Mephitidae</b> and a branch that contained Procyonidae and Mustelidae. The mitogenomic distance between the wolf and the dog was shown {{to be at the}} same level as that of basal human divergences.

40|$|The Brazilian Quaternary {{terrestrial}} Carnivora {{are represented}} by the following families: Canidae, Felidae, Ursidae, Procyonidae <b>Mephitidae</b> and Mustelidae.

A stratigraphical controlled collection in the sedimentary deposit of the studied cave revealed a fossiliferous level where the following Carnivora taxa were present: Panthera onca, Leopardus sp., Galictis cuja, Procyon cancrivorus, Nasua nasua and Arctotherium wingei. Dating by Electron Spinning Resonance indicates that this assemblage was deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at least, 22. 000 YBP.

40|$|This {{research}} is an ethnozoologic study {{based on the}} analysis of the traditional knowledge that the autochthonous inhabitants of the community of Zacualpan de Amilpas, Morelos, Mexico, have in what refers to the native birds and mammals associated with groves. The methodology was applied in four stages: contact with the pertinent authorities, identification of key informants, grove survey, interviewing and sampling to observe and corroborate the species identified by the informants. Thus, 34 bird common names pertaining to 26 species, 6 orders and 15 families were registered. Passeriformes was the order with the highest species number, and Tyrannidae and Icteridae were the most representative families. For mammals, 16 common names were recognized pertaining to 18 species, 6 orders and 10 families; the order Carnivora and the family <b>Mephitidae</b> had the largest species number. The use values registered were: alimentary, medicinal, ornamental and as good-luck charms. Species are hunted using shotguns and slingshots. Community members recognize three environmental services (seed dispersion, insect predation and pollination) that 16 species carry out.

40|$|Between January 2007 and December 2010, the {{abundance}} of medium-sized mammals was studied, with special focus on the Molina's hog-nosed skunk, Conepatus chinga (Molina, 1782), at four locations in southern Brazil. In this study, transect line methodology was used to obtain data for Distance Analyses. Transects were traveled by car at night, searching with spotlights {{along the edges of}} secondary roads in agricultural landscapes. Along 1, 811 km, we obtained 620 observations of 20 mammal species. The most common species was the exotic European hare, Lepus europaeus (Pallas, 1778); the highest abundance estimated for South America was observed in one of the study areas, where its density was estimated as 32 individuals/km². Carnivores were the most commonly recorded mammals, represented by 10 species and comprising 51 % of all observations. Molina's hog-nosed skunk occurred in all study areas, but occurred in sufficient numbers to obtain density estimates in only two of the areas. We estimated 1. 4 to 3. 8 individuals/km², in the first density estimate made by the transect method for a member of Conepatus in the Neotropics. These values are similar to those estimated for North American species of <b>Mephitidae.</b> In Brazil, C. chinga is apparently more abundant in the Pampa biome than in the grasslands of the Atlantic Forest.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. in free ranging neotropical carnivores from Brazil. 158 blood samples were analyzed from Canidae, Procyonidae and <b>Mephitidae</b> from Emas National Park, in the State of Goias, Brazil. From the sampling total, 75 were obtained from Chrysocyon brachyurus (maned wolf), 65 from Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating dog), 10 from Conepatus semistriatus (striped hog-nosed skunk), 06 from Lycalopex vetulus (hoary fox) and two from Nasua nasua (South American coati). Hepatozoon spp. were diagnosed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) after DNA was extracted. From the total analyzed, 63. 92 % samples were parasitized by Hepatozoon; and from the positive samples 41. 14 % were collected from C. brachyurus, 18. 35 % from C. thous, 3. 79 % from L. vetulus and 0. 63 % from N. nasua. The majority of C. brachyurus population (86. 66 %) was infected and also 44. 61 % of C. thous and 100 % of L. vetulus studied. Molecular characterization of the isolates was performed after sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. These demonstrated that the isolates from C. thous and the majority of the ones from C.

40|$|Abstract Background Although it {{has proven}} to be an {{important}} foundation for investigations of carnivoran ecology, biology and evolution, the complete species-level supertree for Carnivora of Bininda-Emonds et al. is showing its age. Additional, largely molecular sequence data are now available for many species and the advancement of computer technology means that many of the limitations of the original analysis can now be avoided. We therefore sought to provide an updated estimate of the phylogenetic relationships within all extant Carnivora, again using supertree analysis to be able to analyze as much of the global phylogenetic database for the group as possible. Results In total, 188 source trees were combined, representing 114 trees from the literature together with 74 newly constructed gene trees derived from nearly 45, 000 bp of sequence data from GenBank. The greater availability of sequence data means that the new supertree is almost completely resolved and also better reflects current phylogenetic opinion (for example, supporting a monophyletic <b>Mephitidae,</b> Eupleridae and Prionodontidae; placing Nandinia binotata as sister to the remaining Feliformia). Following an initial rapid radiation, diversification rate analyses indicate a downturn in the net speciation rate within the past three million years as well as a possible increase some 18. 0 million years ago; numerous diversification rate shifts within the order were also identified. Conclusions Together, the two carnivore supertrees remain the only complete phylogenetic estimates for all extant species and the new supertree, like the old one, will form a key tool in helping us to further understand the biology of this charismatic group of carnivores. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{determined}} the complete sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra). We then compared these new sequences with orthologues of nine carnivores belonging to six families (Mustelidae, <b>Mephitidae,</b> Canidae, Hyaenidae, Ursidae, and Felidae). The comparative analyses identified all the conserved regions previously found in mammals. The Eurasian otter and seven other species have a single location with tandem repeats in the right domain, while the spotted hyena (Hyaenidae) and the tiger (Felidae) have repeated sequences in both {{the right and left}} domains. To assess the degree of genetic heterogeneity of the Eurasian otter in Italy we sequenced two fragments of the gene and analyzed length polymorphisms of repeated sequences and heteroplasmy in 32 specimens. The study includes 23 museum specimens collected in northern, central, and southern Italy; most of these specimens are from extinct populations, while the southern Italian samples belong to the sole extant Italian population of the Eurasian otter. The study also includes all the captive-reared animals living in the colony "Centro Lontra, Caramanico Terme" (Pescara, central Italy). The colony is maintained for reintroduction of the species. We found a low level of genetic polymorphism; a single haplotype is dominant, but our data indicate the presence in central and southern Italy of two slightly divergent haplotypes. One haplotype belongs to an extinct population, the other is present in the single extant Italian population. Analyses of length polymorphisms and heteroplasmy indicate that the autochthonous Italian samples are characterized by a distinct array of repeated sequences from captive-reared animals...|$|E
40|$|Updating the {{evolutionary}} history of Carnivora (Mammalia) : a new species-level supertree complete with divergence time estimates Katrin Nyakatura 1 and Olaf RP Bininda-Emonds 2 * Background: Although it {{has proven to}} be an important foundation for investigations of carnivoran ecology, biology and evolution, the complete species-level supertree for Carnivora of Bininda-Emonds et al. is showing its age. Additional, largely molecular sequence data are now available for many species and the advancement of computer technology means that many of the limitations of the original analysis can now be avoided. We therefore sought to provide an updated estimate of the phylogenetic relationships within all extant Carnivora, again using supertree analysis to be able to analyze as much of the global phylogenetic database for the group as possible. Results: In total, 188 source trees were combined, representing 114 trees from the literature together with 74 newly constructed gene trees derived from nearly 45, 000 bp of sequence data from GenBank. The greater availability of sequence data means that the new supertree is almost completely resolved and also better reflects current phylogenetic opinion (for example, supporting a monophyletic <b>Mephitidae,</b> Eupleridae and Prionodontidae; placing Nandinia binotata as sister to the remaining Feliformia). Following an initial rapid radiation, diversification rate analyses indicate a downturn in the net speciation rate within the past three million years as well as a possible increase some 18. 0 million years ago; numerous diversification rate shifts within the order were also identified. Conclusions: Together, the two carnivore supertrees remain the only complete phylogenetic estimates for all extant species and the new supertree, like the old one, will form a key tool in helping us to further understand the biology of this charismatic group of carnivores...|$|E
