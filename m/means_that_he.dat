5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the organizer of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was likely imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, {{even though he has}} never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, {{while still}} at the PTR, Bothe became a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{completed}} his Habilitation, and, in 1929, he became an ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) there.|$|E

50|$|Appleby had {{perhaps the}} longest career {{of any of}} the great detectives. In Silence Observed <b>he</b> states <b>that</b> his age is fifty-three, which, if the action of the book takes place in the year of publication, would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in 1907 or 1908. This is contradicted in The Gay Phoenix where <b>he</b> says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was twenty-nine when he married. He becomes engaged in Appleby's End, {{published}} 1945, which would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in 1916.|$|R

25|$|There is no {{provision}} in the will of Robert Quigley King that mentions his Missouri farm or Grassland Farm, which probably <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had given them outright during his life to his sons Ward and Leffler respectively. However, {{at the time of}} his father's death, Leffler had moved back to Springfield, leaving his son, Edwin Askam King in charge of Grassland Farm.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May 2015, the Guardian {{reported}} that ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi {{was recovering from}} severe injuries he received from an 18 March 2015 airstrike, {{in a part of}} Mosul. In the meantime, Abu Alaa Afri had assumed control of ISIL as Deputy Leader. It was also {{reported that}} al-Baghdadi's spinal injury, which left him incapacitated, <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may never be able to fully resume direct command of ISIL.|$|E
25|$|Khatami {{was born}} on 29 September 1943, {{in the small town}} of Ardakan, in Yazd Province. Khatami holds the title of Sayyid, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a direct patrilineal descent from Muhammad. He married Zohreh Sadeghi, {{daughter}} of a famous professor of religious law, and niece of Musa al-Sadr, in 1974 (at the age of 31). They have two daughters and one son: Leila (born 1975), Narges (born 1980), and Emad (born 1988).|$|E

25|$|As {{part of his}} plea, Milken {{agreed to}} pay $200 million in fines. At the same time, he agreed to a {{settlement}} with the SEC in which he paid $400 million to investors who had been hurt by his actions. He also accepted a lifetime ban from any involvement in the securities industry. In a related civil lawsuit against Drexel he agreed to pay $500 million to Drexel's investors. In total this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> paid $1.1 billion for all lawsuits related to his actions while working at Drexel.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{continued}} to play for Warwickshire into his late forties, and when he retired from playing {{at the age of}} 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is likely to remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. Never much of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe is reticent {{about his}} youth, but {{apparently}} he was athletic, fit, and adventurous. Before World War I, he spied for the Austrian government's Evidenzbureau, {{but had a}} change of heart when the war began. He then joined the Serbian-Montenegrin army and fought against the Austrians and Germans. That <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was likely to have been involved in the harrowing 1915 withdrawal of the defeated Serbian army, when thousands of soldiers died from disease, starvation, and sheer exhaustion — which might help to explain the comfort-loving habits that are such a conspicuous part of his character. After a time in Europe and North Africa, he came to the United States.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant Calley {{testified that}} he heard the {{shooting}} and arrived on the scene. He observed his men firing into a ditch with Vietnamese people inside and he then started shooting, with an M16, {{from a distance of}} 5 feet. Then, a helicopter landed {{on the other side of}} the ditch and a pilot asked Calley if he could provide any medical assistance to the wounded civilians in My Lai; Calley admitted replying that a hand grenade was the only available <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had for their evacuation. After that, around 11:00, Captain Medina radioed to cease fire and the 1st Platoon took a lunch break.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s honor code {{led him to}} save Captain America from {{drowning}} because Captain America {{had earlier}} saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, {{for no other reason}} than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone’s hands but his own.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} Carthage, Maximus studied several Neo-Platonist writers {{and became a}} {{prominent}} author. When {{one of his friends}} began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the Chalcedonian position that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity. His Christological positions eventually resulted in his torture and exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople, and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His feast day is celebrated twice during the year: on 21 January and on 13 August. His title of Confessor <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suffered for the faith, but not to the point of death, and thus is distinguished from a martyr. His Life of the Virgin is thought to be the earliest complete biography of Mary, the mother of Jesus.|$|E
