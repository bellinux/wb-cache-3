40|$|The new {{computer-based}} registration system, {{a project}} of the National Museum of Geology and Mineralogy in the Netherlands, will considerably increase the accessibility of the Museum collection. This greater access is realized by computerisation of the data in great detail, so that an almost unlimited number of operations to select and sort the data is possible. A flexible design of annotating information, mainly in plain words, saves considerable time. The fast <b>mechanical</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> permits the efficient preparation of catalogues which contain selected information about the geological collection; as an additional benefit labels may be produced at low costs. The RGM system disposes {{of the burden of}} classical registration books and card-indexes, without any essential quality being lost. It combines a minimum of man-hours with an optimal flexibility in storage and retrieval of data, and an acceptable employment of computer time and equipment. The system may also serve for the registration of collections of other institutions, in geology as well as zoology and botany...|$|E
50|$|MEMS: micro-electromechanical {{systems are}} the key {{ingredient}} of micro-mechatronics. Micro-electromechanical systems are - as the name suggests - devices with significant dimensions in the micrometre regime or less. Highly suited to integration with electronic and microwave circuitry, they provide the key to electro-mechanical functionalities unachievable with classical precision mechatronics. Commercialisation of mass-produced Microelectromechanical systems products is rapidly picking up pace and includes printer ink-jet technology, 3D accelerometers, integrated pressure sensors, and Digital Light Processing (DLP) displays. At {{the cutting edge of}} Microelectromechanical systems fabrication and integration technologies are nano- electromechanical systems (NEMS). Typical examples are micrometres long, tens of nanometres thick, and have mechanical resonance frequencies approaching 100 MHz. Their small physical dimensions and mass (of order pico-grams) makes them highly sensitive to changes in stiffness; this, their synergy with <b>mechanical</b> and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems, and the option of attaching chemical/ biological molecules, makes them ideal for ultra high-performance mechanical, chemical and biological sensing applications.|$|R
40|$|We discuss an in situ marine {{imaging system}} based on {{high-speed}} digital line scan cameras for collection of a continuous picture of microscopic marine particles {{ranging in size from}} 200 µm to several centimeters. The system is built to operate on a 53 -cm-diameter autonomous underwater vehicle or a tethered platform. The digital imaging system provides a continuous record of all particles passing through a symmetric 96 x 96 mm sampling tube and provides views from two orthogonal directions.

40|$|Moore's law {{was first}} {{postulated}} in 1968, and it loosely {{says that the}} cost of making calculations on a computer falls by 50 % each year. Securities markets are, in essence, a form of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, Moore’s law has driven important changes in those markets over the past forty years. Faster <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> was essential for major changes in securities trading. Increased turnover of portfolios was a result of faster <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, the criticism of that turnover may be misplaced. The effectiveness of regulatory changes, such as the lowering of brokerage commissions and the reduction in bid ask spreads, depended on reduced <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> costs, that is on Moore's Law.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> complexity, partitionability, {{locality}} and provenance play {{a crucial}} role in the effectiveness of distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Dynamics in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> necessitates effective modeling which allows the understanding and reasoning of the fluidity of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Through virtualization, resources have become scattered, heterogeneous, and dynamic in performance and networking. In this paper, we propose a new distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> model based on automata where <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is modeled as state transformations. This approach falls within a category of declarative concurrent paradigms which are fundamentally different than imperative approaches in that communication and function order are not explicitly modeled. This allows an abstraction of concurrency and thus suited for distributed systems. Automata give us a way to formally describe <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> independent from underlying processes while also providing routing information to route data based on its current state in a P 2 P fashion around networks of distributed processing nodes. Through an implementation, named Pumpkin, of the model we capture the automata schema and routing table into a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> protocol and show how globally distributed resources can be brought together in a collaborative way to form a <b>processing</b> plane where <b>data</b> objects are self-routable on the plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the status of electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and/or functions in the public schools of Indiana. To provide additional insight to the organizational structure of a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center, four existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers serving a group of school districts in adjoining states through a centrally located computer facility were examined. The procedures used in collecting and analyzing the data for the study included the following: (1) appropriate data gathering instruments were designed, (2) a questionnaire accompanied by a cover letter explaining the {{purpose of the}} study was mailed to each superintendent of all school corporations in Indiana, (3) a personal interview was conducted with the administrative personnel directly responsible for the operation of each of the four selected regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers, (3) <b>data</b> obtained from the questionnaire and the personal interview were compiled, tabulated, analyzed, and presented, and (4) the findings, conclusions and recommendations for further study were presented. The superintendents were asked to respond to the question, "Do you presently utilize <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> (computer and punch card) equipment in any part of the operation and/or administration of your school district?" Those school administrators responding "YES" were then asked to indicate those services and functions which were accomplished in their school corporation, to indicate the method of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and to indicate methods. All of the superintendents were asked to indicate their future plans for the use of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services in their local school corporation(s). The systematic analysis of the procedures necessary for implementing educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts in adjoining states included the following elements: (1) background information, (2) objectives, (3) historical development, (4) equipment, (5) personnel, (6) services and/or functions, (7) orientation procedures, (8) advantages of a central computer facility, (9) disadvantages of a central computer facility, and (10) future plans. The findings indicated the following major general conclusions to be appropriate the level of their satisfaction with both services. There has been only limited development toward the organization of educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems throughout the state of Indiana. This situation lends itself to collective exploration by interested school administrators toward cooperative arrangements of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services, regardless of the size of the school district. Qualified and competent personnel must be responsible for the operation of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center. The director of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center should be totally familiar with all facets of school administration so that he may use electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to facilitate the instructional program. A central computer facility organized to provide electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts is capable of supporting the more sophisticated computer equipment at a reduction in cost, provided the equipment is operating at a near capacity work load. It is possible for a group of school districts to benefit from the developmental experience of existing <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. The amount of time once considered necessary to progress from feasibility of operation to full-scale implementation has been greatly reduced by administrators' capitalizing on the systematic developments of existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. School districts involved in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> can benefit from the efforts of an administrative officer whose function is to systematically analyze administrative operations. This individual is referred to as a systems analyst or operations analyst. Teleprocessing has great potential for providing electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to school districts regardless of size. Teleprocessing provides school administrators with direct access to sophisticated electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> equipment and computer programs which have been successfully developed and implemented in other school districts. The Indiana Department of Education should assume the leadership in establishing regional service centers throughout Indiana to provide comprehensive educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to local school districts.
