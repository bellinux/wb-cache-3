40|$|An {{array of}} {{electrochemical}} quartz crystal electrodes (EQCM) modified with nanostructured films based on phthalocyanines {{was developed and}} used to discriminate musts prepared from different varieties of grapes. Nanostructured films of iron, nickel and copper phthalocyanines were deposited on Pt/quartz crystals through the Layer by Layer technique by alternating layers of the corresponding phthalocyanine and poly-allylamine hydrochloride. Simultaneous electrochemical and mass measurements were used to study the mass changes accompanying the oxidation of electroactive species present in <b>must</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from six Spanish varieties of grapes (Juan García, Prieto Picudo, Mencía Regadío, Cabernet Sauvignon, Garnacha and Tempranillo). The mass and voltammetric outputs were processed using three-way models.

Multi-way partial least squares (N-PLS) evidenced the correlations existing between the voltammetric data and the polyphenolic content measured by chemical methods.

50|$|Previous studies {{focusing}} on description-based prospects suffered from one drawback: {{the lack of}} external validity. In the natural environment, people’s decisions must be made without a clear description of the probabilities of the alternatives. Instead, decisions must be made by drawing upon past experiences. In experience-based studies, then, the outcomes and probabilities of the two possible choices are not initially presented to the participants. Instead, participants <b>must</b> <b>sample</b> from these choices, and they can only learn the outcomes from feedback after making their choices.

By traditional culture-dependent methods, we isolated 3805 colonies, distinguished by molecular methods in 17 different species. 544 isolates were analysed for the main oenological characteristics such as fermentative vigor with and without sulphites, sugar consumption, and production of alcohol, volatile acidity, hydrogen sulphide, glycerol and β-glucosidase. This analysis identified Kluyveromyces marxianus (seldomly used in winemaking) as the most interesting candidate yeast for the production of innovative wines. This article is protected by copyright.

30|$|According to the Shannon/Nyquist {{sampling}} theorem [1, 2], if {{we would}} like to avoid lose of information when capturing a signal, we <b>must</b> <b>sample</b> the signal at the so-called Nyquist rate, which means twice the highest frequency of the signal. Since the theorem only exploits the bandlimitedness of a signal and most real-world signals are sparse or compressible, the process of massive data acquisition based on Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem usually samples too many useless information and eventually we have to compress to store or encode a very few essential information of the signal. Obviously, this process is extremely wasteful and therefore, a more effective sampling way to directly acquire the essential information of a signal has been expected.|$|R

In streaming models, in which algorithms can access the input only a constant number of times and only sequentially, we show that, even with randomization, any algorithm that determines if there exists any pair of vertices with a large common neighborhood must essentially store and process the input graph off line.

40|$|The Shannon/Nyquist {{sampling}} theorem specifies {{that for}} lossless capture of a signal, one <b>must</b> <b>sample</b> {{at least two}} {{times faster than the}} largest frequency content of the signal. In many applications, the Nyquist rate is so high that too many samples result, making compression a necessity prior to storage or transmission. But if the signal has a sparse representation in some domain, the novel idea of compressive sampling [9] could be used to exploit the sparsity and thus significantly reduce sampling rate of the signal. In this paper a simulation of an efficient system for integrating video coding/compression with acquisition through compressive sampling is developed in detail. Simulation is implemented for the Y-components of video frames and qualitative comparison is done with traditionally acquired frames. 1...|$|R
40|$|Taxon {{sampling}} {{is often}} {{thought to be}} of extreme im-portance for phylogenetic inference, and increased sam-pling of taxa is commonly advocated {{as a solution to}} re-solving problematic phylogenies.

In an ideal world, one would like to increase samples of both taxa and genes, but taxon sampling has not kept up with the pace of gene sampling increase because of the increasing ease and em-phasis on genome sequencing. The question of taxon sampling is necessarily driven by resource limitation. The precise scope of “sufficient” taxon sampling is always dependent on questions be-ing addressed.

40|$|Abstract—This paper details a {{modification}} to the Dendritic Cell Algorithm so that residual and prior {{information about a}} potential attack {{may be used to}} infer the current state of a machine using soft computing techniques. Presented in this paper is the biological background needed along with the original algorithm, a deterministic form, and our modifications to create the Fuzzy Dendritic Cell algorithm. In the original form of the algorithm, an agent <b>must</b> stochastically <b>sample</b> an antigen until enough information is collected so that the agent may report itself as being mature or semi-mature. In the deterministic form, the agent <b>must</b> <b>sample</b> all dimensions of this antigen vector which deviates from the biological approach, yet provides a complete picture of an attack. While trying to model the human Dendritic Cell, our approach uses partial prior information from other agents, the information stochastically collected from a current agent, and successfully determines the agents maturity while reducing the amount of samples required to about 10 % of the total dimensions in an antigen vector. This provides an approach similar to human Dendritic Cell, but also allows improves runtime costs when evaluating large dimensional antigen vectors over the original algorithm. Our approach also provides a way to incorporate traditional Artificial Immune System approaches such as Self, Non-Self Discrimination so that a complete Artificial Immune System may be realized.
