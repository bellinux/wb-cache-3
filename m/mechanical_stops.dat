2500|$|Older CMG models {{like the}} ones {{launched}} with Skylab in 1973 had limited gimbal travel between fixed <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> On the [...] Skylab CMGs the limits were plus or minus 80 degrees from zero for the inner gimbals, and from plus 220 degrees to minus 130 degrees for the outer ones (so zero was offset by 45 degrees from the centre of travel). Visualising the inner angle as 'latitude' and the outer as 'longitude', {{it can be seen}} that for an individual CMG there were 'blind spots' with radius 10 degrees of latitude at the 'North and South poles', and an additional 'blind strip' of width 10 degrees of 'longitude' running from pole to pole, centred on the line of 'longitude' at plus 135 degrees. These 'blind areas' represented directions in which the rotor's spin axis could never be pointed.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanical}} train stops {{have been}} found to be relatively safe with their historic models from the 19th century to be still in use in the 21st century. Because of the quadratic force increments in relation to speed these mechanical systems are restricted to low speed applications. Their continued usage can be found in urban rapid transit systems with trains making no more than 100 km/h. Whereas later contactless train stops require a working receiver on the train to initiate the emergency stop (as for PCCS or Indusi) the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> have initially been kicking the brakes directly.|$|E

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{disadvantages}} of the eddy current speedometer is that it cannot show the vehicle speed when running in reverse gear since the cup would turn {{in the opposite direction}} - in this scenario the needle would be driven against its <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> pin on the zero position.|$|R

5000|$|The optical gimbal {{transceiver}} {{holds the}} uplink camera and the laser collimator on a 2-axis gimbal. [...] Due to laser safety considerations, the gimbal may not shine on {{anything on the}} ISS. [...] To avoid this, the gimbal is designed with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> and electromechanical limit switches so that its field of regard (the area where it can point) is limited to 36° wide in elevation and 106° in azimuth, where the azimuthal axis is generally {{in the direction of}} motion of the ISS. [...] Because of the gimbal field of regard geometry, the flight system can only perform downlinks when the ISS is north of the ground station.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fixed jaw}} is {{attached}} to the shaft with a pivot pin so that the entire jaw assembly can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits the jaws to be rotated over the end of the shaft {{so that they can be}} [...] "flipped" [...] over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> limit this rotation to 180° so that when the jaws assembly is resting at a stop, the jaws will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, the jaws are automatically held against the stop by gravity. Basin wrenches are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.|$|E

50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|E

40|$|A new {{flip-chip}} solder {{technology has}} been developed for the precision self-alignment of an optoelectronic module without using <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> A main feature of the technology is the controlled self-alignment sequence: laser is aligned to a polymer waveguide in the lateral and vertical directions, then it slowly makes a contact with the waveguide in the axial direction. The elimination {{of the use of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> significantly simplifies the process. The axial distance between the laser and the waveguide is very small; it is determined by the contacting edges and a tilt angle of 12 o. The lateral alignment accuracy is less than 2 m. Introduction Solder self-alignment is important in the area of optoelectronics. In addition to providing electrical connections, solder {{is also one of the}} enabling technologies for passive precision alignments. Between 1990 and 1995, there were at least 60 papers and 8 U.

40|$|Development of the Body Flap Actuation Subsystem for Space Shuttles {{included}} alterations {{from the}} original design to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops,</b> planet gears, control valves, and solenoid valves. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> were redesigned to absorb stall load and rotating inertia of the hydraulic motors instead of only stall load. The institution of a quill shaft (torsion spring) was a successful solution. The planet gears in the geared rotary actuators developed cracks during testing. This failure was alleviated via modification to the gears. A motor pressurization - brake release timing technique was developed thru analysis and testing. This resulted in a control valve configuration which would not permit freewheeling of the body flap surface. Finally, several solenoid valve configurations were tested to obtain the desired performance. Conceptual redesigns and modifications were weighted against each other to optimize a solution. Tradeoffs were usually made between life, performance, failure tolerance, and reliability versus weight, envelope, and maintainability...|$|E
