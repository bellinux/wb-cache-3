5|$|In {{association}} football, kit (also {{referred to}} as strip or soccer uniform) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's Laws of the Game specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that, {{in the event of}} a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team <b>must</b> <b>change</b> to different coloured attire.|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations <b>must</b> <b>change</b> one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E

5|$|After A You {{spends time}} in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his {{problems}} are solved and returns to take {{him away from the}} imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he <b>must</b> <b>change</b> that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset <b>must</b> <b>change</b> for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R <b>must</b> <b>change</b> over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|Line 11, {{one of the}} two {{branch lines}} of the metro system, {{operates}} a different partial service pattern. Trains travelling to and from the branch line terminate at Huaqiao Station and Sanlin respectively.

25|$|D mesons are {{the lightest}} {{particle}} containing charm quarks. They are often studied to gain knowledge on the weak interaction.

25|$|Partial service {{patterns}} {{exist on}} Lines 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Partial services serve only a (usually busier) sub-segment {{of the entire}} physical line. In addition, Line 2 has a piecewise service pattern whereby the suburban segment between Guanglan Road Station and Pudong International Airport Station is served by a 4-car fleet separately. Passengers traveling across Guanglan Road on Line 2 <b>must</b> <b>change</b> trains across the platform at Guanglan Road.|$|E

These through trains <b>must</b> <b>change</b> {{locomotives}} at New Haven, as the track north to Springfield is not electrified, unlike the Northeast Corridor. The locomotive change is from a Siemens ACS-64 in the electrified territory to a General Electric P42DC for the Springfield Line non-electrified territory, or vice versa.|$|E

30|$|The inventive {{problems}} may {{be located in}} different stage of design process. For example, the problem is identified in the stage of conceptual design. The engineers must solve the problem using some methods or tools in TRIZ and generate solutions. The solutions are {{then returned to the}} conceptual design stage and original concept of the product <b>must</b> be <b>changed</b> or redesigned. The following stages, embodiment and detailed design <b>must</b> also be <b>changed.</b> After the chain reaction to the solutions of the inventive problem the new design or new document is formed. If the inventive problem is in the stage of embodiment design, the original embodiment and the detailed design <b>must</b> be <b>changed.</b> If the problem is in the stage of detailed design, the only original detailed design <b>must</b> be <b>changed.</b> As a result the main design process and the training process are connected seamlessly which is a new type of redesign process.|$|R
25|$|In other words, electrostatics {{does not}} require the absence of {{magnetic}} fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents do exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they <b>must</b> <b>change</b> with time only very slowly. In some problems, both electrostatics and magnetostatics may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as Galilean limits for electromagnetism.|$|E
25|$|For some memristors, applied {{current or}} voltage causes {{substantial}} change in resistance. Such devices may {{be characterized as}} switches by investigating the time and energy that must be spent to achieve a desired change in resistance. This assumes that the applied voltage remains constant. Solving for energy dissipation during a single switching event reveals that for a memristor to switch from Ron to Roff in time Ton to Toff, the charge <b>must</b> <b>change</b> by ΔQ = QonQoff.|$|E
25|$|Long Branch is {{connected}} to New York City and Northern New Jersey via NJ Transit trains running on the North Jersey Coast Line.

A second station is located at Elberon district just north of the borough of Deal. In the past there were stops in the West End neighborhood and on Broadway, but they were closed to reduce travel time to New York City.|$|E
