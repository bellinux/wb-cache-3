500|$|In his PopMatters review, John Bergstrom likens All Things Must Pass to [...] "the {{sound of}} Harrison exhaling", noting: [...] "He was quite {{possibly}} the only Beatle who was completely {{satisfied with the}} Beatles being gone." [...] Bergstrom credits the album with heavily influencing bands such as ELO, <b>My</b> <b>Morning</b> Jacket, Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, as well as helping bring about the dream pop phenomenon.

[...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Mac Randall writes that the album is exceptional, but [...] "a tad overrated" [...] by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise [...] "a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once". Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of Apple Jam as [...] "a very significant flaw", while recognising that its content [...] "proved to be of immense musical importance", {{with the formation of}} Derek and the Dominos. Writing for Pitchfork Media in 2016, Jayson Green said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who [...] "changed the terms of what an album could be" [...] since, although All Things Must Pass was not the first rock triple LP, [...] "in the cultural imagination, it is the first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement." ...|$|E
