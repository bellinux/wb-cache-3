5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian {{group in}} the United States that was {{organized}} {{after a period of}} repeated business depressions during the 1890s. The society had its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American utopian group.|$|E
5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> successes against the Gothas.|$|E
25|$|St-Laurent {{supported}} King's {{decision to}} introduce conscription in 1944, {{despite the lack}} of support from other French Canadians (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). His support prevented <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> Quebec Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) from leaving the party, and was therefore crucial to keeping the government and the party united.|$|E

25|$|In his {{first-class}} career, {{he scored}} 12,421 first-class runs, including 11 hundreds, {{at a relatively}} low average of 24.35, this figure depressed {{at least in part}} because of his attacking instincts: in only one season (1956) when he played <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> games did he average above 30. However, he passed 1,000 runs in a season five times.|$|E
25|$|Hugh Findlay and {{his fellow}} missionaries {{ultimately}} found little success in India. He served in Poona and Bombay for several years, most of it alone. Brigham Young ordered the mission closed in 1855.

A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts. Nödtveidt and Vlad were members of a satanic organization called Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO), of which Vlad was one of the founders, and that, according to the police, never had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> followers.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} on which Dundale Hall is located was originally purchased by an industrialist, Israel Morris II, in 1874, and was {{built as a}} mansion for his family.

25|$|The {{community}} of Benedictine nuns at Black Ladies was very small. At dissolution in 1538, {{there were only}} three nuns and the prioress to receive pensions. A canonical visitation in 1521 had also found only four nuns living in the priory. It seems that the community never numbered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful.</b> They were, however, supported by a number of lay servants and officials. A chaplain and seven other employees had to be paid off at the dissolution. As well as the financial problems associated with small and scattered endowments, the community seems to have struggled with management and governance.|$|R

The wolf checks his foot and finds all ten of his toes still there, to his relief. Billy then tries to eat the wolf's spare tire, but is unable to chew the rubber and ends up shaped like the tire as soon as he swallows it whole.|$|R
25|$|Between 1865 and 1868, Reaney, Son & Archbold secured {{contracts}} {{for only two}} vessels of over 1,000 tons—the 1,430 ton passenger-cargo ship Thomas Kelso in 1865, and the 1,074 ton passenger-cargo vessel Tioga in 1867. In 1866 it also built the 671-ton sidewheel steamer Samuel M. Felton, which for some years was the fastest vessel on the Delaware River on the route between Philadelphia and Wilmington. Apart from these however, the yard could secure little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> {{contracts for}} tugboats and barges and for ship repairs.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{some members}} of Congress were taking action to {{reschedule}} the drug legislatively. In 1981, the late Rep. Stuart McKinney introduced a bill to transfer cannabis to Schedule II. It was co-sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of 84 House members, including prominent Republicans Newt Gingrich (GA), Bill McCollum (FL), John Porter (IL), and Frank Wolf (VA). After the bill died in committee, Rep. Barney Frank began annually introducing nearly identical legislation.

25|$|Bergen {{and others}} argue {{that there was no}} need to recruit foreigners {{unfamiliar}} with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight; that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.|$|E

50|$|Except {{for these}} two one-off 4 valve engines with {{characteristic}} ribbed cam covers, all the FWMVs used in 1965 season were 2 valve Mk.5 or earlier versions with various levels of upgrade. This was because Coventry Climax had started the FWMW flat-16 project, which was finally announced {{at the beginning of}} 1965, and had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> in things needed to be developed or solved, so the 4 valve configuration on FWMV did not get completely developed nor did reach a series production.

50|$|When Egner {{took charge}} of the church in 1922, there was a {{membership}} of about 40. Under his leadership the church began to grow and in 1932 it had a membership of 325. During those ten years the Sunday school experienced a rapid growth. When Egner came to the church, there were little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> enrolled. In 1932 the enrollment was 300. There also was an active Young People's Organization and a women's society which has loyally supported the pastor in his work in behalf of the church. In 1932, Special Services marked the 10th anniversary of Rev. John H. Egner's pastorate.|$|R
25|$|The Liberals under Jean Chrétien had governed Canada since 1993, {{and were}} never really {{threatened}} by the divided right during the Chrétien era. Especially important in the Liberals' electoral success was the province of Ontario. From 1993 to 2004, the Liberals utterly dominated Canada's most populous province. Both Reform and the PC Party received many votes, {{but because of the}} first past the post (FPTP) system, this was not enough to win <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> Ontario's approximately 103 seats. At the same time, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, who some suggested were kindred spirits in policy and direction to Reform and Blue Tory PCs, had formed a provincial government under Premier Mike Harris.|$|E
25|$|Those Californians {{wishing to}} run for {{governor}} were given until August 9 to file. The requirements to run were relatively low and attracted a number of interesting and strange candidates. A California citizen needed only to gather 65 signatures from their own party and pay a nonrefundable $3,500 fee to become a candidate, or in lieu of the fee collect up to 10,000 signatures from any party, the fee being prorated by the fraction of 10,000 valid signatures the candidate filed. No candidate in fact collected <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> signatures-in-lieu, so that all paid almost the entire fee. In addition, however, candidates from recognized third parties were allowed on the ballot with no fee if they could collect 150 signatures from their own party.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian left-wing {{became a}} major {{priority}} for intelligence services in the RCMP during the period between the two world wars, particularity focusing on the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). As {{the likelihood of a}} second world war increased in 1938, some attention shifted to fascist movements in Canada. In these years, at divisions and in the field, the number of persons involved in intelligence work varied enormously. This number did not usually exceed 10 to 20 officers in major cities and most work was done on a part-time basis. Likewise, the full-time Ottawa intelligence staff never exceeded <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> personnel in the inter-war period. However, the efforts of Ottawa and out-lying divisions produced hundreds of thousands of pages of material in the period alone.|$|E
5000|$|The song whose {{lyrics are}} {{described}} just above is widely attributed to Ronald Blackwell. There {{seems to be}} no controversy (although various titles are occasionally used) that one with a similar title was earlier written and recorded by the Big Bopper, and released as [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] (N.B.: with [...] "little" [...] spelled out) late in 1958 as the B-side of his second hit. The searchable sites with its complete lyrics as text seem to constitute no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful,</b> but <b>a</b> recording, purported to be of his voice and thus presumably as being authoritative as to lyrics, exists online.|$|R

5000|$|Far {{from seeing}} a chorale cantata cycle tied to Bach's {{second year in}} Leipzig, Philipp Spitta, in the 1880 second volume of his Bach-biography, {{described}} the chorale cantata as a genre Bach only converged to in his later years.

Questionable chronologies and minor differences aside, they followed in Spitta's footsteps praising Bach's so-called [...] "later" [...] chorale cantatas as an epitome of the composer's art.|$|R
25|$|NY283 {{begins in}} {{downtown}} Watertown, where it meets US11, NY3, and NY12 at the city's Public Square. The two-lane route departs US11 and NY12 at a 45-degree angle and maintains a northeasterly routing through a commercialized {{part of the}} city as Factory Street. It parallels the southern bank of the Black River to {{the eastern edge of the}} downtown district, where the highway crosses the waterway by way of Sewalls Island and becomes known as Pearl Street. On the opposite riverbank, NY283 serves another brief stretch of businesses before leaving the city limits and entering the town of Pamelia. Here, the line of commercial properties gives way to open, rolling fields as the route heads northeastward across the southern part of the town. The highway serves little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> isolated homes and businesses before curving slightly northward at the Pamelia–Le Ray town line.|$|E
25|$|A {{key benefit}} that professionalism brought to rugby union {{as a whole}} was the {{elimination}} of the constant defection of union players who were attracted to the money of rugby league. The rugby union authorities of the time also hoped that as players could now play in either code, in the long term most of the sponsorship and interest would gravitate away from league to the more international game of union. However, rugby union has not managed to lure away <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> elite players from rugby league, as the two codes have become quite different over the decades of separation in both culture and in aspects of play. The preferred body type and skill sets of players differ, especially in the play of the forwards. With access to players of different types, some more suited to one code and some to the other, some English rugby union clubs have even formed partnerships with a rugby league club which plays in the premier rugby league competitions – the most notable example being Harlequins with London Broncos (formerly Harlequins Rugby League), and between Wigan Warriors and Saracens.|$|E
500|$|Weird Tales {{is widely}} collected, and many issues command very high prices. [...] In 2008, Mike Ashley {{estimated}} {{the first issue}} to be worth £3,000 in excellent condition, and added that the second issue is much rarer and commands higher prices. [...] Issues with stories by Lovecraft or Howard are very highly sought-after, with the October 1923 issue, containing [...] "Dagon", Lovecraft's first appearance in Weird Tales, fetching comparable prices to the first two issues.

50|$|Although {{the path}} of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council had been {{effectively}} blocked, the High Court could not block appeals from State supreme courts directly to the Privy Council. Nor did the Constitution limit, or provide for legislation to limit, such appeals. The expense of any appeal to the Privy Council in London had been a deterrent: in any year, {{there had never been}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful.</b> Nonetheless, by the 1980s the possibility of appeal from a State supreme court was seen as outdated. In addition, in 1978 confusion over the relative precedential value of High Court and Privy Council decisions had been introduced when the High Court ruled that it would no longer be bound by Privy Council decisions.|$|R
50|$|German {{immigration}} {{was motivated}} {{in part by}} religious intolerance and warfare in central Europe {{as well as by}} frequently difficult economic conditions. Catherine II's declaration freed German immigrants from military service (imposed on native Russians) and from most taxes. It placed the new arrivals outside of Russia's feudal hierarchy and granted them considerable internal autonomy. Moving to Russia gave German immigrants political rights that they would not have possessed in their own lands. Religious minorities found these terms very agreeable, particularly Mennonites from the Vistula River valley. Their unwillingness to participate in military service, and their long tradition of dissent from mainstream Lutheranism and Calvinism, made life under the Prussians very difficult for them. Nearly all of the Prussian Mennonites emigrated to Russia over the following century, leaving no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> in Prussia.|$|R

The film uses the RMS Queen Mary as a stand-in for Poseidon, using actual onboard locations as well as model shots. The captain (Leslie Nielsen) complains about Poseidon being top-heavy and hence vulnerable to capsizing by tsunamis, and he makes clear his intent to take on ballast, but the representative of the owners refuses to allow this and indeed, orders him to proceed at full speed, threatening to fire him and replace him with another officer. Of the hundreds aboard, no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> survive.|$|R
