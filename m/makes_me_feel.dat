5|$|Bergstein then shopped {{the script}} around to other studios but was {{repeatedly}} rejected, until she {{brought it to}} Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio division of Stamford, Connecticut, based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video distribution company. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, He <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5million, {{at a time when the}} average cost for a film was $12million.|$|E
25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot refracting telescope. In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E

Directed by production company The Young Astronauts. In interview with Idolator, Grande explained: “We’re doing two visuals because this song <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> two kinds of ways, it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> sexy and glamorous — I {{wanted to do a}} simpler more glam-themed video — and then I wanted to do another video because it makes me feel… like a super version of myself in a way.” Discussing the song with Madeline Rotj from MTV, Grande stated about the concept behind the song's second video: ...|$|E

She refuses {{to take part in}} overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim Hot 100 list.|$|E

McCartney later said that Mills's {{contribution}} was giving him an acrylic fingernail to protect a finger on his left hand that often bled after playing guitar.

500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed.

It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E

I wanna make music that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel {{was inspired by the}} singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say?

Following the second chorus, Grande sings the hook, [...] "All girls wanna be like that/Bad girls underneath, like that/You know how I'm feeling inside" [...] accompanied by an electronic riff reminiscent of trap music. A reviewer from Sputnikmusic noted that the track's lyrics are [...] "a cross between sexually charged and fully empowering." [...] Commenting about the lyrical content of [...] "Dangerous Woman", Grande stated: [...] "This song is about an empowered woman who meets another person that brings out a different side of her. It's her decision to put her fears aside and explore these new feelings. It's about letting someone into your life in an intimate and vulnerable way and not letting that take away from your independence and strength." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions {{other than}} Ireland {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany. George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The {{first night of the}} Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: [...] "I am glad we have been bombed. It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> we can look the East End in the face." [...] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations {{as the rest of the}} country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.|$|E

500|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that by the end}} of the war, 80tons of bombs had fallen on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green alone, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. In Bethnal Green, 555 people were killed, and 400 were seriously injured. For the whole of Tower Hamlets, a total of 2,221 civilians were killed, and 7,472 were injured, with 46,482 houses destroyed and 47,574 damaged. [...] So badly battered was the East End that when Buckingham Palace was hit during the height of the bombing, Queen Elizabeth observed that [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> I can look the East End in the face." [...] By the end of the war, the East End was a scene of devastation, with large areas derelict and depopulated. War production was changed quickly to making prefabricated houses, and many were installed in the bombed areas and remained common into the 1970s. Today, 1950s and 1960s architecture dominates the housing estates of the area such as the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, much of which was built as a show-piece of the 1951 Festival of Britain.|$|E
500|$|Ball then {{requested}} {{a few days}} off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with No.8 Squadron, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French espionage agent across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused {{to get out of the}} aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross [...] "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," [...] particularly for [...] "one occasion [...] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents [...] "I only scrap because it is my duty...

500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey".

When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like a white man in a basement in Atlanta". Diddy later called [...] "Coming Home" [...] a gift from Jay-Z and Kid. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by EMI Music Publishing, the song {{was written in the}} key of D major with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he has made in the past and that he wants to put behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E
