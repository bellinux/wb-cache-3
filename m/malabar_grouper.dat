40|$|Eleven {{species were}} {{differentiated}} among more than 300 monogeneans {{collected on the}} gills of two wild <b>malabar</b> <b>groupers,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus, caught in the lagoon of New Caledonia, South Pacific. Diplectanids included seven species of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958, which were differentiated mainly {{on the basis of}} morphology of the sclerotised vagina. P. manifestus n. sp. was the most abundant species (65 – 80 % of the diplectanids); all other species were rare. It is characterised by morphology of its vagina, in general shape of a question mark. P. malabaricus n. sp. and P. maternus n. sp. both have a vagina with two spherical chambers, and are differentiated on the basis of measurements of these chambers. P. manipulus n. sp. has an elongate vagina with a long primary chamber. P. marcellus n. sp. has a long vagina with two bends. P. maaensis n. sp. has a long vagina with a straight primary canal and the two chambers united in a common sclerotised part. Two specimens were provisorily attributed to P. cf. shenzhenensis Yang, Zeng & Gibson, 2005. Diplectanum maa n. sp. has a funnel-shaped male copulatory organ.

50|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus maaensis is a diplectanid monogenean {{parasitic}} on {{the gills}} of the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus. It {{has been described}} in 2007.|$|E
50|$|As most fish, the <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> {{harbours}} {{a variety}} of parasites, including the diplectanid monogeneans Pseudorhabdosynochus manifestus, P. maaensis, P. malabaricus, P. manipulus, P. marcellus, and P. maternus.|$|E
50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host of P. maaensis is the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality is Bay Maa near Nouméa, New Caledonia {{where it was}} considered a rare species.|$|E
5000|$|Epinephelus malabaricus is a protogynous hermaphrodite, {{as these}} fishes {{at some point}} in their {{lifespan}} change sex from female to male. [...] <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> are voracious predators, they feed on fish, crustaceans, and occasionally, cephalopods.|$|E
50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host of P. malabaricus is the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality and only recorded locality is the Barrier Reef off Nouméa, New Caledonia {{where it was}} considered a rare species.|$|E
50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host of P. marcellus is the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality is near Nouméa, New Caledonia {{where it was}} considered a very rare species (only 1% of the diplectanids found).|$|E

50|$|This giant fish {{is similar}} to the <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> and its colour changes with age. The giant grouper has a large mouth and a rounded tail. Juveniles have {{irregular}} black and yellow markings, while adults are green-grey to grey-brown with faint mottling, with numerous small black spots on the fins.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical {{waters of the}} Indo-West Pacific area from the eastern coast of Africa to the Tonga Islands, Red Sea included. It has also been recorded in the Levantine Sea and the eastern Mediterranean, as a Lessespian migrant through the Suez Canal, although it is still rather rare in the Mediterranean. [...] This grouper lives in various habitats, such as lagoons, mangroves, coral and rocky reefs, sandy and muddy bottom areas, between 2 and 150 m deep. [...] The juveniles prefers lagoon or brackish areas.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus malabaricus {{is part of}} {{a series}} of six species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, all {{described}} from the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus. The authors indicated that [...] "names of all new species described begin all by ‘ma-’ to provide an easy way to identify these species from E. malabaricus among the numerous species of Pseudorhabdosynochus already described or to be described". The species are P. maaensis, P. malabaricus, P. manifestus, P. manipulus, P. marcellus, and P. maternus. More precisely, for this species, the name malabaricus is derived from the name of the host.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> {{can reach}} a length up to 234 cm (92 in), but average size is usually around 100 cm (39 in). [...] It has a light grey to light {{brownish}} background color, {{with a number}} of dark brown spots randomly scattered, which increase in number with age. The body has also a various number of brown diagonal stripes. Younger fish have a number of wide, broken vertical bands of darker shade across their bodies, but in maturity they seem to become a uniform darker colour. Young fish have numerous brown spots. The tail fin is rounded.|$|E

40|$|Data {{have been}} {{collected}} on those crucial aspects of the biology of Blue and King Threadfins, Estuary Rockcod, <b>Malabar</b> <b>Grouper</b> and Mangrove Jack that are required to develop appropriate management plans for conserving the stocks of these five commercially and recreationally important species. The following biological data have been obtained. (1) The size and age at which each species reaches sexual maturity. (2) The size and age at which the two species of threadfin change from male to female and the Estuary Rockcod and <b>Malabar</b> <b>Grouper</b> change from female to male. Note that, unlike the above four species, the Mangrove Jack is not hermaphroditic and thus does not change sex. (3) The habitats, size and age compositions, duration and location of spawning, and mortality of each species. As the two threadfin species are largely restricted to areas over bare substrate in nearshore waters, they are particularly accessible to fishers. Our results indicate that, currently, the Blue Threadfin is fully exploited and the King Threadfin is over-exploited, whereas the fisheries for the Estuary Rockcod, <b>Malabar</b> <b>Grouper</b> and Mangrove Jack are apparently sustainable at current fishing levels. However, our results emphasize that fishing mortality has a very marked adverse impact on the abundance of the ultimate sex of the four hermaphroditic species, and {{this needs to be}} considered when specifying legal lengths for retention. Managers also need to monitor the status of the stocks of Mangrove Jack which, because of its high value, is attracting an increasing amount of attention from the recreational, commercial and charter boat fishing sectors. Finally, {{the results of this study}} emphasize the pressing need to develop better methods for determining the natural mortality of fish species and thus being able to derive more robust estimates of fishing mortality...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} enhance {{encounters}} with prey, planktonic predators may display different swimming behavior {{with respect to}} food availability and distribution. In this study, we used 3 D video techniques to record the swimming behavior of <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus malabaricus) larvae in both the absence {{and the presence of}} prey (Artemia sp. nauplii). Swimming properties were investigated in all of the 3 D, the two vertical, and the horizontal projections using scale-dependent (mean speed and Net to Gross Displacement Ratio) and scale-independent (fractal dimension) metrics. When prey was added, larvae swam slower and in a less convoluted way as compared to what was observed in the absence of food. The results obtained with scale-dependant metrics were confirmed by those obtained with scale-independent analyses. Both unveiled the anisotropy of the swimming behavior of grouper larvae that tend to swim toward the vertical axis in order to maximize encounters with prey patches. This study shows that <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae can optimize their search volume by switching their behavior and further draws attention to the need to consider both vertical- and horizontal-projections components while addressing the plankter's swimming trajectorie...|$|E

The presence of 11 species of monogeneans in this fish, after a previous published record of 12 species in E. maculatus, provides additional argument for existence of a very rich fauna of monogeneans in groupers, and an impressive parasite biodiversity in coral reef fish in general. Lists are given for other parasites of the <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> including monogeneans, digeneans, cestodes and nematodes, including new records from New Caledonia; more than 40 parasite species have been recorded in the literature.

30|$|Grouper is a {{high value}} cultured marine fish {{especially}} in the Southeast Asia countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines (Liao et al., 2001; Yashiro, 2008). The major cultured species are giant grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus (Yashiro, 2008), tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (Sugama et al., 2008), <b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus malabaricus (Yashiro, 2008), orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (Toledo et al. 1996), humpback grouper, Cromileptes altivelis (Marte, 2003), leopard coralgrouper, Plectropomus leopardus (De Silva, 1998) and hybrid grouper, (Epinephelus lanceolatus X Epinephelus fuscoguttatus). Heemstra and Randall (1993) estimated that 90 % of the world’s harvest on marine food is derived from artisanal fisheries, which groupers are the major component. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (2013), world aqu of (2880 saculture production of groupers was around 6000 – 7000 tones per annum, valued at about USD 60 million and the bulk of this production came from wild seed stock {{due to lack of}} reared seed that suffered disease problems.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an economic analysis of the aquaculture of two species of grouper E. coloides (orangeâ€�spotted grouper, green grouper, redâ€�spotted grouper) and E. malabaricus (<b>malabar</b> <b>grouper,</b> blackâ€�spotted grouper) for small producers in the Philippines. The findings of the analysis indicate that, based on the assumptions, grouper culture is financially feasible. However, the capital requirements for the broodstock, hatchery/nursery, and integrated system may be beyond the financial means of many small producers. These stages of grouper culture may need to be developed as a larger project by private investors or government. The capital investment requirement for growâ€�out (not including purchase of transport boxes) is within the financial means of small producers. Loans or other incentives will need to be made available for the small producer, but the cash flow indicates that these loans can be repaid {{in the first year of}} production.

40|$|International audienceIt was {{hypothesized}} that the <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> Ephinephelus malabaricus larvae have developed search patterns adapted to the distribution of their prey to maximise their net energy intake per unit time. Analysis of the swimming behaviour of E. malabaricus larvae in both the presence and absence of Artemia sp. nauplii is presented to test this hypothesis. A method derived from turbulence studies (the moment function of the displacements) was used to characterize the behaviour. The results revealed that larval swimming pattern was multifractal (intermittent and long-range-correlated) and isotropic (i. e. uniform in all directions) {{in the presence of}} prey, but multifractal and anisotropic (i. e. more frequent long displacement on the vertical axis) in the absence of prey. It is suggested that the search behaviour observed in the absence of prey is an adaptive response to prey distribution pattern, which is often characterised by multifractality and anisotropy (i. e. larger patches on the horizontal axes). In the presence of prey, E. malabaricus shifted to intensive search behaviour. Other possible contributors to the observed patterns are discussed. It is concluded that multifractality and anisotropy of swimming patterns observed in the experiment are mainly explained in an optimal foraging theory framework...|$|E

In the earthern pond, from a mean size of 183 mm SE 21. 67 and 137. 9 g SE 4. 78 in May 1997 E. tauvina attained 442 mm 4. 25 and 1780 g SE 4. 79 in March 1998 {{at the end of}} eleven months showing a daily growth increment of 0. 78 mm and 4. 97 g. In the silpaulin lined pond, E. malabaricus grew from an average size of 163. 2 mm SE 2. 96 (74. 2 g SE 2. 09) in April 1997 to 425. 7 mm SE 3. 65 (1170 g SE 4. 67) in March 1998 registering a mean growth of 0. 72 mm (3. 04 g) per day. The average daily growth increment for E. tauvina in the FRP tank during the culture period was only 0. 51 mm (1. 53 g).

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology and}} fishery-related {{characteristics of the}} <b>Malabar</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus malabaricus) (Bloch and Schneider, 1801) specimens were investigated. The size of females ranged from 25 to 113 [*]cm total length (LT), with 50 % sexually mature at 79 [*]cm LT, and the males (97 [*]cm to 114 [*]cm LT) were larger than the females. Due to the sex ratios and size distribution of the sample, {{it appeared that the}} groupers change sex between 97 and 113 [*]cm LT. However, the gonadal histology data lacked specimens in the transitional stage. The spawning peak occurred in November, as defined by the presence of ripe females, and the spawning season lasted from September to February. The size of the fish correlated positively with the water depth at capture, which is also related to oxygen levels in deep water being more favourable for larger fish. Larger specimens (> 100 [*]cm LT) were targeted by fishers between December and February, when the northeast monsoon coincides with calmer weather and the spawning season. Fishers were interviewed, and observations were made on fishing gear, vessels, and grounds. There was no indication that small-scale fishers targeted spawning aggregations; therefore, fisheries independent research is recommended in order to verify the time, location, and behaviour of the spawning of Malabar groupers for management and conservation purposes...|$|E
