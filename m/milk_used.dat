5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's <b>milk,</b> <b>used</b> {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E

25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the <b>milk</b> <b>used</b> to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E

In the early 1980s, Rodda's signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in-flight desserts.

[...] There is much speculation on the breed's evolution, but Italian professor Silvano Maletto theorizes [...] based on evidence obtained from fossil records and cave writings [...] that the breed descends from ancient Aurochs cattle and the Pakistan Zebu cattle. Reports of the first historical evidence for breeding Piedmontese cattle dates back only to the late 1800s, and credits the work of another Italian professor, Domenico Vallada.|$|E

2500|$|Yogurt, yoghurt, or yoghourt ( [...] or {{from other}} spellings listed below) is a food {{produced}} by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria {{used to make}} yogurt are known as [...] "yogurt cultures". Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks {{is also used to}} produce yogurt where available locally. <b>Milk</b> <b>used</b> may be homogenized or not (milk distributed {{in many parts of the}} world is homogenized); both types may be used, with substantially different results.|$|E
2500|$|Although cow's milk is {{the basis}} of almost all infant formula, plain cow's milk is unsuited for infants because of its high casein content and low whey content, and {{untreated}} cow's milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition. [...] To reduce the negative effect on the infant's digestive system, cow's <b>milk</b> <b>used</b> for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes steps to make protein more easily digestible and alter the whey-to-casein protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called [...] "fortification", see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to respond to growing {{consumer}} awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: [...] "British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics {{of the food and}} drink they buy". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007, the quantity of <b>milk</b> <b>used</b> by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.|$|E
2500|$|Developed {{countries}} adopted milk pasteurization {{to prevent}} such disease and loss of life, {{and as a result}} milk is now widely considered one of the safest foods. [...] A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the keeping qualities of butter was practiced in Great Britain before 1773 and was introduced to Boston in the British Colonies by 1773, although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years. It was still being referred to as a [...] "new" [...] process in American newspapers as late as 1802. Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886. In the early 20th century, Milton Joseph Rosenau established the standards (i.e. low temperature, slow heating at 60°C (140°F) [...] for 20 minutes) for the pasteurization of milk while at the United States Marine Hospital Service, notably in his publication of The Milk Question (1912). [...] States in the U.S.A. began enacting mandatory dairy pasteurization laws with the first in 1947, and in 1973 the U.S. Federal Government required pasteurization of <b>milk</b> <b>used</b> in any interstate commerce.|$|E

40|$|Kefir is {{a unique}} {{fermented}} dairy product that is produced by a mixture of lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and yeast. In this study, a culture-independent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to enumerate lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and yeast in kefir grain and kefir <b>milk</b> <b>using</b> group-specific primers. The most abundant microbial groups were lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria, followed by yeast (P? 0. 05) in both kefir grain and kefir milk. The most leading genera of lactic acid bacteria and yeast were Lactobacillus/Lactococcus (P? 0. 05) and Candida, respectively. All microbial groups were present in lower numbers in kefir milk than in kefir grain (P? 0. 05), except for Enterococcus and Saccharomyces groups. This is the first report to characterize the number of specific microbial populations in kefir grain and kefir <b>milk</b> <b>using</b> quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, we successfully established the methods for the quantification of microorganisms in kefir grain and kefir <b>milk</b> <b>using</b> group-specific quantitative real-time PCR and provided quantitative microbiological information for quality control of kefir. Practical ApplicationsThis report describes the enumerative methods of microorganisms in the kefir grain and kefir <b>milk</b> <b>using</b> group-specific quantitative real-time PCR assay. It could facilitate the microbiological quality control of kefir-fermented milk and grain {{and can be used}} in further studies to understand the fermentation process of kefir milk.
