He {{was the first to}} investigate the normal physiology of leptin in humans, including circadian rhythms and the role of leptin in fasting and with relation to body weight. His team has published the only three studies on leptin pharmacokinetics determining leptin doses to be used in humans. Indeed, his research broadened the understanding of the neuroendocrine function of leptin on body weight, energy homeostasis, gender differentiation, immunology and the interaction with other hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone and sex steroids. Observing that hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and lipodystrophy were conditions of hypoleptinemia, he piloted clinical trials to test the efficacy of leptin to treat these conditions, showing that leptin replacement in patients with HA and lipodystrophy resulted in complete normalization of hormone axes and bone density in HA as well as insulin resistance and metabolic regulation in lipodystrophy. Additionally, he observed that functional changes in how the brain views food occur in subjects with hypoleptinemia and that these can be corrected with leptin replacement. Dr. Mantzoros and his team observed that short-term <b>metreleptin</b> treatment enhanced activity in areas detecting the salience and rewarding value of food during fasting, while long-term treatment decreased attention to and the rewarding value of food after feeding. Furthermore, hypothalamic activity is modulated by <b>metreleptin</b> treatment and leptin decreases functional connectivity of the hypothalamus to key feeding-related areas in these hypoleptinemic subjects.

These syndromes are characterized by partial or complete absence of adipose tissue and hormones derived from adipose tissue, most importantly leptin. Patients deficient in leptin exhibit a number of severe metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis, which can progress to diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis, and hepatic cirrhosis, respectively. For the management of these abnormalities, multiple therapies are usually required, and advanced stages may be progressively difficult to treat. Following many successful trials, the US Food and Drug Administration approved <b>metreleptin</b> {{for the treatment of}} non-HIV-related forms of generalized lipodystrophy. Leptin replacement therapy with <b>metreleptin</b> has, in many cases, reversed these metabolic complications, with improvements in glucose-insulin-lipid homeostasis, and regression of fatty liver disease.

40|$|Leptin, a {{peptide hormone}} {{secreted}} by adipocytes in {{proportion of the}} amount of energy stored in fat, plays a central role in regulating human energy homeostasis, controlling food intake, reproductive and immune functions. As a cytokine, leptin can affect thymic homeostasis and the secretion of acute-phase reactants such as interleukin- 1 and tumour-necrosis factor (1). Decreased levels of leptin, also known as hypoleptinemia, signal to the brain a state of energy deprivation. Hypoleptinemia can be a congenital or acquired condition, and is associated with alterations of several neuroendocrine axes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -thyroid, -growth hormone, and -adrenal axes (2). A model of acquired chronic hypoleptinemia induced by negative energy balance is the hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA), previously it has been demonstrated that hypoleptinemia underlies the dysfunction of neuroendocrine axes and bone metabolism associated with HA (3). In uncontrolled human studies, low leptin levels are associated with impaired immune responses and reduced T cell counts but effects of leptin replacement on the adaptive immune system have not yet been reported in the context of randomized controlled studies and/or in conditions of chronic, acquired leptin deficiency.

30|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of obese children, no syndromal or monogenic cause for the obese state can be diagnosed and therefore a polygenic cause is suggested. Generally, monogenic forms of childhood obesity are very rare [2]. Mutations in only a few genes are known to cause the development of severe obesity in early childhood [2]. Most of these genes are involved in the central nervous regulation of hunger and satiety where the leptin/leptin receptor system plays a pivotal role [3]. Of all monogenic forms of obesity, the only one causally treatable is congenital leptin deficiency caused by homozygous mutations of the leptin gene [4]. Leptin is a protein secreted mainly by adipocytes, and its circulating levels correlate positively with the body mass index and the body fat mass. By central as well as peripheral action, leptin impacts diverse physiological processes including energy balance, metabolism, endocrine regulation, and immune function [3]. One of the main functions of leptin is to control the body fat mass by inhibiting food intake via the central nervous system.

Molecules released by the enlarged adipose tissue, {{most of which are}} pro-inflammatory, have been named adipokines. The present review deals with function, molecular targets and the potential clinical relevance of adipokines. Currently, more than 600 adipokines have been identified, many of them, including leptin, visfatin, resistin as well as Retinol Binding Protein 4 may serve as informative markers for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and play important roles in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity as well as metabolic regulation of energy expenditure. Adiponectin on the contrary exerts anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing activity. Adiponectin has additional anti-atherogenic effects and low adiponectin serum concentrations are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. The understanding of the role of adipokines has provided a wealth of information that has opened great opportunities for new therapeutic advances. Adiponectin may be the most prominent example for the potential use of an adipokine in the treatment of obesity and obesity-associated metabolic diseases. In many studies, administration of recombinant adiponectin results in improved insulin sensitivity, increased insulin secretion and beneficial effects on body weight and hyperglycemia.

We describe their weight loss efficacy, mode of action at both pharmacological and behavioural levels, where understood, together with the range of side effects that might be expected in clinical use. We have however evaluated these compounds against the considerably more rigorous criteria that are now being used by the Federal Drugs Agency and European Medicines Agency to decide approvals and market withdrawals. Several trends are evident. Recent advances in the understanding of energy balance control have resulted in the exploitation of a number of new targets, some of which have yielded promising data in clinical trials for weight loss. A second major trend is derived from the hypothesis that improved weight loss efficacy over current therapy is most likely to emerge from treatments targeting multiple mechanisms of energy balance control. This reasoning has {{led to the development of}} a number of new treatments for obesity where multiple mechanisms are targeted, either by a single molecule, such as tesofensine, or through drug combinations such as qnexa, contrave, empatic, and pramlintide. +. <b>metreleptin.</b> Many of these approaches also utilise advances in formulation technology to widen safety margins. Finally, the practicality of peptide therapies for obesity has become better validated in recent studies and this may allow more rapid exploitation of novel targets, rather than awaiting the development of orally available small molecules. We conclude that novel, more efficacious and better tolerated treatments for obesity may become available in the near futur...|$|E
40|$|Leptin is a 16 kDa {{hormone that}} is mainly {{expressed}} in adipose tissues (1). The major target of leptin is hypothalamus and it suppresses food intake and energy consumption, consequently diminishing adipose deposits and body weight (2, 3). The OB gene was isolated by Friedman in 1994 (4).   Based on {{the suggestion of}} Roger Guillemin, Friedman named this new hormone "leptin" from the Greek lepto meaning thin (5, 6). Since leptin discovery, numerous {{studies have been conducted}} on its physiological effects and its function in pathological conditions. Most of studies on leptin concentrated on its metabolic actions (7), receptors (8) and further broad functions such as immunity modulation (9) and memory processing (10). Considering such a vast range of functions, it is clear that patients with lack of leptin physiologically need pharmacological interventions. At this moment, we are in the twentieth year of leptin discovery. Finally, FDA approved a drug named Myalept (<b>metreleptin</b> for injection) on February 2014 to treat rare metabolic disease caused by leptin deficiency. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is a disorder with partial lack of fat tissues (11). The trial for the safety and effectiveness of Myalept demonstrated decrease in HbA 1 c, fasting blood glucose, and triglycerides (11). Nevertheless, there are some limitations to the usage of Myalept in HIV-related lipodystrophy and some metabolic disorders (11). Moreover, it may increase the risk of lymphoma by producing anti-metreleptin antibodies neutralizing endogenous leptin. Considering these concerns, Myalept is available only through a limited profile under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Myalept is contraindicated in patients with general obesity not related to congenital leptin deficiency (12). Even though, Myalept has very limited indications for use in general population, it is considered a milestone towards the discovery of novel treatments for Leptin deficiencies and disorders. Future investigations are necessary for the discovery of unknown aspects of Myalept therapy and production of new leptin-based agents for treatment of a wide spectrum of diseases.
