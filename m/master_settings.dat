40|$|The {{purpose of}} diploma thesis is {{to simplify the}} {{implementation}} of printouts in the project realisation phase of the SAP information system within a company. Printouts are often a neglected subject in the initiation process, as in the beginning, the main focus {{is always on the}} inventory of commercial processes and on the accurate creation of <b>master</b> data and <b>settings.</b> This is of course understandable, because a company must ensure its data are properly stored and processed. Unfortunately, {{at the beginning of the}} use of the information system, users tend to assess the quality of implementation by the appearance of prints, which is usually the final result or final piece of information of the running process in the SAP system. As far as the design and the coding of printouts is concerned, companies often run short of time, and therefore this part of the process is not included in the calculation of the budget frame. This diploma thesis describes the development of preconfigured SAP printouts for a sales module, covering the best practices from the business world. The implementation of sales printouts is parameterized by preconfigured printouts. Therefore, the intervention of an ABAP programmer is no longer needed. Outprints can be set by a SAP consultant...|$|R
30|$|The {{challenging}} {{elements such}} as the situations, <b>settings,</b> <b>mastered</b> skills, and the unpredictable outcomes are the components that trigger the practitioners to act and think in higher order thinking fashion. Of course some scholars might believe that the meta-cognitive thinking abilities act as the connecting neural network in the process which in turn may fuel or decelerate the fashionable pattern of thought. This is not the sole elements. An identical higher order thinker may act totally different in an identical time of occurrence {{if and only if}} the identical time is repeated. That is to say, the human element may act totally different as his/her perception of the environment in atomic and holistic pattern may differ in the axis of time and place. Such weight of elements is beyond metacognitive thinking pattern of thought. The concept of higher order thinking is rooted in the ingredients of experience from early childhood up to the moment of committing higher order thinking thoughts. The lower order thinking taxonomies and higher order ones and even the revised taxonomies of higher order thinking agenda proposed by Bloom are the due ingredients of higher order thinking thoughts, the thought which is a wise one and is considered a wisdom thought based on the unbiased judgment of the individual, unique in its time and place.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the discourse strategies Italian learners of German as a foreign language, embedded in the PR courses taught at University of Udine (Italy), need for professional purposes, in order to assure the transfer of knowledge which interactions in the PR field are based on. Therefore, the research question seeks to understand which discourse strategies will help to convey the knowledge and allow the students to build upon domain-specific competencies as well as start and evaluate self-guided learning processes. In this perspective, the paper will first investigate which communicative situations have to be <b>mastered</b> in professional <b>settings</b> linked with the German speaking area, which potential addressees and functions {{are supposed to be}} relevant, which text-/discourse-types will be used. The related discourse strategies for information as well as for argumentation or persuasion purposes will be analyzed, by taking in account their fitting corporate and/or political communication. As for the analysis of discourse strategies apt to foster the learning process the following issues will be unfolded: considering that the embedding of the German course for special purposes allows to reach at the curriculum’s end the B 1 -B 2 level defined by the European Common Framework of Reference, which professional features/ competencies can be realised? How can students be induced to detect transfer difficulties related to intercultural diversity? How can discourse strategies suited to handle with these difficulties be taught...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} the world’s major {{libraries}} are embarking on large-scale projects to digitize books, journals, newspapers, and other printed materials. The main purpose of these mass digitization initiatives is to make published content visible to text indexing engines and accessible online for viewing and printing. The projects also present significant archiving challenges: capabilities must be developed within libraries to manage {{the hundreds of millions}} of files comprising their master volumes. Even with the cheap disks and fast networks available today, projects of this scale must implement space-efficient imaging strategies to minimize long-term storage costs and maximize efficiencies for processing tasks such as file transfer, dynamic generation of deliverables, and migration. Libraries have had to accept that page image masters must be compressed, and that lossless compression of grayscale and color data will not achieve the efficiencies they are seeking in mass digitization. In this paper, we present findings from studies coordinated by the California Digital Library, the Internet Archive, the Harvard University Library, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France to evaluate relationships between file size and perceived image quality for lossy compressed JPEG 2000 (JP 2) images. We employed similar, but not identical, methods to create small test suites of source page images, which were then processed by four command-line JP 2 codecs to produce images that observers rated from “perfect ” to “unacceptable. ” We present viable technical profiles for lossy JP 2 encoding of page image <b>masters,</b> with recommended <b>settings</b> for selected command-line codecs. We are maintaining test suites of digitized book pages and invite others to use them to extend efforts to develop robust image processing algorithms that balance quality and file size in a variety of page image products...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{demand for}} energy {{globally}} has remained unabated; technology and enterprise alignment is meeting this challenge. The current production of transport fuel is increasing with diesel fuel mostly in demand. This trend {{has continued to}} put more facilities {{on the world stage}} and is akin to inevitable spills in the outlook. The level of preparedness for such eventuality will make the difference in curbing emergencies in the future. The dwindling resources generated by ‘Oil Spill Response enterprise’ due to enhanced technology, reduction in large spill incidents, and neglect for small spills have continued to underscore their relevance in the industry. The demeanour would be to have a more positive nature to planning and prevention with greater ability to predict and effectively carry out response services when necessary. Getting to this height of adeptness would require a comprehensive risk and cost-benefit analysis of the scenarios. The present body of knowledge for GTL diesel and related products is very vague on spill behaviour, control, and recovery in the tropics where commercial production of the product exist and so the emphasis in this dissertation is on actions that make a logical show given what is known. The ‘Evaluation’ through computer-based planning modelled (simulation) attempts and analytical modelling approach has shown “dispersion” as most influential weathering process for GTL-diesels and thus led to generation of ‘GTL diesel loss rate’ Chart for real time and forecast application. Furthermore, this analysis also helps corporate management and spill response contractors face the risks associated with spillage and reduce uncertainties by enhancing preventive measures via adoption of PERREP model. These innovative idea(s) are the best probable way out in spill response process with a proactive disposition that would allow adaptable techniques, materials and tools to be employed in local <b>settings.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|MSc (Dietetics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background Benefits of {{breastfeeding}} {{for infants}} and mothers are well recognized. South Africa {{has a very}} low breastfeeding rate. Strategies to improve and promote exclusive breastfeeding rates include implementation of human milk banks (HMB). The North West Province started its first HMB in 2012 and the success and sustainability will depend on numerous factors, including identification of possible barriers to donation or receiving donor human milk. In support of such an intervention, the attitudes of each relevant stakeholders, mothers, community members and health care providers on acceptability of donating and receiving donated breastmilk is therefore important {{for the success of}} such an intervention Objectives The objective of this dissertation was determining the attitudes on acceptability regarding the donation and receiving of human breast milk for key stakeholders, namely mothers, healthcare workers and the elderly representing grandmothers. Methods This study was conducted at a public hospital and nearby clinics in North West province, South Africa using qualitative research methodology of focus group discussions (FGDs) for data collection. Eight focus groups discussed the attitudes, 3 of mothers of 0 to 12 month old infants (n= 13), 3 of elderly participants older than 60 years (n= 17) and 2 of healthcare professionals, working with infants younger than 1 year (n= 11). Results Important attitudes on acceptability of receiving and donating human donor milk were identified from the literature and this research project. Stakeholders had safety and cultural concerns regarding donation and receiving of donated human milk. Participants also indicated the need for education that may improve the attitudes. These findings may inform future policy planning and HMB promotion in communities. The identified attitudes reflected barriers to exclusive breast feeding, donating and receiving breast milk. These included, the need for HIV screening; cultural beliefs relating to transfer of personality traits and bonding and fears of not having enough milk for their own infants; perceived changes in quality of donated milk during pasteurisation and transportation as well as HIV transmission. Conclusion The study identified important attitudes that may be possible barriers and fears to accepting or donating human breast milk. Some of the identified attitudes could also limit exclusive breast feeding. Further research is recommended to determine how prevalent the identified attitudes are in this and similar community <b>settings.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} Sensor Nodes (SNs) {{spatially}} removed from one another, that can monitor {{a variety of}} environmental conditions. SNs then collaboratively communicate the collected information to a central location, by passing along the data in a multi-hop fashion. SN energy resources are limited and energy monitoring and preservation in WSNs are therefore very important. Since multi-hop communication takes place, the routing protocol used may {{have a significant effect}} on the balanced use and preservation of energy in the WSN. A significant amount of research has been performed on energy efficient routing in WSNs, but the majority of these studies were only implemented in simulation. The simulation engines used to perform these studies do not take into account all of the relevant environmental factors affecting energy efficiency. In order to comment on the feasibility of a routing protocol meant to improve the energy efficiency of a WSN, it is important to test the routing scheme in a realistic environment. In this study, a SN specifically designed to be used in an energy consumption ascertaining WSN testbed was developed. This SN has a unique set of features which makes it ideal for this application. Each SN is capable of recording its own power consumption. The design also features a lithium battery charging circuit which improves the reusability of the SN. Each node has a detachable sensor module and transceiver module which enables the researcher to conduct experiments using various transceivers and sensors. Twenty of these SNs were then used to form an energy consumption ascertaining WSN testbed. This testbed was used to compare the energy consumption of a Minimum Total Transmission Power Routing (MTTPR) scheme to a shortest hop path routing scheme. The results show that each SN’s transmission power setting dependant efficiency has a significant effect on the overall performance of the MTTPR scheme. The MTTPR scheme might in some cases use more energy than a shortest hop path routing scheme because the transmission power setting dependant efficiency of the transceiver is not taken into account. The MTTPR scheme as well as other similar routing schemes can be improved by taking the transceiver efficiency at different transmission power settings into account. Simulation environments used to evaluate these routing schemes can also be improved by considering the transceiver efficiency at different transmission power <b>settings.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The thesis {{reported}} upon in {{this paper}} addressed the research question &# 039;How does the effective development and communication of a &# 039;project vision&# 039; impact project outcomes?&# 039; It outlines the approach, summarizes results and explains the protocols {{that have been developed}} from the thesis so that others researching this area may: gain better insights and understanding into how project vision may impact upon project success; and have access to a model and protocols to effectively develop a project vision and effectively communicate it to project stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research design was selected with multiple case studies. These were conducted within a public service organization using interviews and action learning through testing a developed protocol for team members to develop a coherent and well understood vision for project outcomes. Results were then used to develop a tool for teams to develop a project vision statement in a structured workshop. This approach was then tested through gathering and analyzing participant feedback from the workshop. Subsequent to this initial workshop and the publication of the thesis, the vision development tool has been further validated in both academic class room <b>settings</b> (<b>Masters</b> of Public Administration students) and with senior public servants as part of a project sponsor course offerings. Participants in both groups have commented on the relevance and effectiveness of the tool in creating a value add project artifact: the project vision. Findings - First, the study established that a clear, well-articulated and convincing project outcomes vision that was effectively communicated made a strong and positive impact upon perceived project success. Second, a protocol was developed and thoroughly tested to develop a project vision. This protocol was found to be successful for the projects it was trialed on and reasons for its acknowledged success were explicated. Third, the study highlighted four emergent issues that require further investigation but for the moment may be risks that need to be managed or opportunities to be exploited. These are: the benefits of an incremental or phased approach; the need for sustainment; the necessity of addressing horizontality; and the imperative of vision champions. Practical implications - Project practitioners should find the approach outlined by the protocol model as being valuable to replicate and adapt to their own project context. Originality/value - While the concept of a clear and well-communicated project vision is now well-accepted there are few examples of rigorous thesis that examine how a vision may be best developed and communicated...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MCur) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Pain is a {{very common}} problem {{experienced}} by the general population and children in particular. It goes beyond personal suffering and affects all dimensions {{of the quality of}} life and general functioning of both adults and children, be it the physiological, psychological or financial aspects. Children may suffer from pain that may either be chronic or acute, depending on the diagnosis. Assessment of pain in children is equally important as that of adults, except that they lack the verbal fluency and cognitive development to communicate their pain. Children’s experience of pain {{is similar to that of}} adults. Pain assessment is a key aspect in the nursing management of children and delivery of care within the Primary Health Care (PHC) setting. Effective pain assessment is thus reliant on comprehensive assessment of the child and his or her pain. The aim of this research was to explore and describe practices and perceptions of professional nurses working in a PHC facility regarding pain assessment of children under five years in the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality and to formulate recommendations for professional nurses in PHC facilities to facilitate pain assessment in PHC settings. A qualitative study design was used and data was collected with the use of focus groups. A purposive sampling was conducted to select participants who represent the target population. The sample used for the study included all the professional nurses working in PHC facilities registered with the South African Nursing Council and that have at least one year of experience. The practical training of the researcher to conduct an interview was done prior to the actual research. A pilot focus group was conducted and the interview schedule was finalised. Semi-structured focus groups were used to obtain data from the participants. The researcher conducted 6 focus group interviews attended by 32 professional nurses. Data was collected until data saturation was achieved. Trustworthiness was ensured in accordance with the principles of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Data was captured on a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were taken during each focus group. Data analysis was done by means of content analysis by the researcher and an independent co-coder. After consensus and saturation, three major themes emerged. Each theme was identified and divided into sub-themes and was consequently discussed together with the relevant data obtained from literature. The findings indicated that professional nurses perceive the assessment of pain in children under five years as a challenge. The combination of signs and symptoms to make decisions with pain assessment was identified as an area of concern. The participants further p erceived the history provided by the parent as important in the process of pain assessment. The conclusions drawn are that the professional nurses acknowledge that they don’t take sufficient notice of pain in children under five, which means that children with pain are neglected. Professional nurses maintain that there is a need for sufficient pain assessment and the need for guidelines and tools to assess pain in children under five, especially in the PHC setting. These professional nurses support the availability of guidelines to assist them to conduct effective and comprehensive pain assessment. The research report concluded with the researcher’s recommendations for nursing education, nursing research and nursing practice with specific formulation of guidelines for the facilitation of professional nurses to truly render effective and comprehensive pain assessment in PHC <b>settings.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
