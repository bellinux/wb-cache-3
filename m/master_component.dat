50|$|The Entertainment Computer System was an add-on {{peripheral}} for the Intellivision. It was Mattel Electronics' second {{attempt at}} creating a peripheral {{to upgrade the}} Intellivision into a home computer, rushed into production to appease the Federal Trade Commission after they began fining Mattel for false advertising following consumer complaints about the repeated delays in releasing the originally planned Intellivision Keyboard Component add-on. The Entertainment Computer System or ECS includes the Computer Module, Music Synthesizer, and additional hand controllers; each sold separately. Any Intellivision <b>Master</b> <b>Component</b> is compatible and a requirement to use the system.|$|E
5000|$|From the beginning, Intellivision's {{packaging}} and promotional materials {{as well as}} television commercials, promised {{the addition of a}} soon-to-be-available accessory called the [...] "Keyboard Component". The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer. The <b>Master</b> <b>Component</b> could be purchased as a stand-alone video game system and the Keyboard Component could be added, providing the computer keyboard and tape drive. Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer, the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre-programmed software and bring [...] "data flow" [...] (Videotex) into the home.|$|E
50|$|The {{device was}} brought to the public in 1982 with an initital lineup of 3 games: Space Spartans, Bomb Squad, and B-17 Bomber. However, despite {{critical}} acclaim, the Intellivoice did not sell nearly as well as Mattel had hoped; while initial orders were as high as 300,000 units for the module and its associated games, most of them just sat on retailers' shelves. Even a promotional giveaway of a free Intellivoice by mail with the purchase of an Intellivision <b>Master</b> <b>Component</b> failed to kick-start sales of the Intellivoice game titles; the fourth Intellivoice game release, Tron: Solar Sailer, sold 90,000 units.|$|E

While these technologies provide assistance in wiring components together they fail to provide support for predicting the quality and behavior of configurations of components prior to actual system composition.

In this paper we discuss the affinities among software architecture, software component technology, compositional reasoning, component property measurement, and component certification for the purpose of <b>mastering</b> <b>component</b> feature interaction, and for developing component technologies that support compositional reasoning, and that guarantee that design-time reasoning assumptions are preserved in deployed component assemblies. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Astrosmash is a {{video game}} for the Intellivision video game console, {{designed}} by John Sohl, and released by Mattel Electronics in 1981. The game involves using a laser cannon to destroy falling meteors, bombs, and other targets. [...] With {{more than one million}} copies sold, Astrosmash was among the top five best selling Intellivision games. A free by mail offer, with the purchase of a <b>master</b> <b>component,</b> boosted Astrosmash sales figures.

5000|$|The Intellivision <b>Master</b> <b>Component</b> was branded and {{distributed}} by various companies. Before Mattel shifted manufacturing to Hong Kong, Mattel Intellivisions were manufactured by GTE Sylvania. GTE Sylvania Intellivisions were produced along with Mattel's with {{the brand name}} the only differentiation. The Sears Super Video Arcade, manufactured by Mattel in Hong Kong, has a restyled beige top cover and detachable controllers. The Sears Intellivision also has a modified Exec removing [...] "Mattel Electronics" [...] from the default titlescreen. In 1983 Radio Shack marketed the Tandyvision One, similar to the original Intellivision but with the gold plates replaced with more wood trim. In Japan Intellivisions were branded by Bandai in 1982, and in Brazil there were Digimed and Digiplay Intellivisions manufactured by Sharp in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Mattel Electronics built a {{state of}} the art voice {{processing}} lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games. However, the amount of speech that could be compressed into an 8K or 12K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited. Intellivoice cartridges Space Spartans and B-17 Bomber did sell about 300,000 copies each, priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges. However, at $79 the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a <b>Master</b> <b>Component.</b> [...] In August 1983 the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out. A children's title called Magic Carousel, and foreign language versions of Space Spartans were completed but shelved. Additional games Woody Woodpecker and Space Shuttle went unfinished with the voice recordings unused.|$|E

30|$|The {{two most}} {{prevalent}} courses of frame alignment in an FRP context are frame bridging and frame amplification. Frame bridging allows an FRP to link previously unconnected <b>master</b> frame <b>components</b> {{so as to}} expand its potential audience. Often times, FRPs divide the electorate in two antagonistic groups with their dualistic frames. Nationalism does this by creating those {{within and outside the}} nation. Populism differentiates between ‘the people’ and the ‘elite’. Authoritarianism differs between those who submit to and those who reject authority. Xenophobia emphasises fear of ‘the other’. In this context, it is advantageous for FRPs to generate overlap between several of these antagonistic categories, thereby bridging different audiences. Frame amplification indicates that certain <b>master</b> frame <b>components</b> take priority over others. Because these components are often directly and most concretely linked to the electorate, this process reduces ambiguity and increase consideration for the (entire) FRP master frame. This is mostly achieved through rhetoric (about immigration, the EU, etc.) and is a particular strength of FRPs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} specifying Web services communities. A Web service is an accessible application that humans, software agents, and other applications in general can discover, compose, and invoke {{in order to satisfy}} users ’ needs like hotel booking. Web services providing the same functionality are gathered into one community, independently of their origins. This framework shows how software agents that are able to argue, negotiate, and reason about Web services can be used to specify these Web services and to manage their respective communities. The use of what we call argumentative agents helps Web services in being better organized within communities and in achieving the goals for which they are conceived. The community is led by a <b>master</b> <b>component,</b> which among others attracts new Web services to the community, retains existing Web services in the community, and identifies the Web services in the community that will participate in composite Web services. All these operations are managed by interacting agents through flexible conversations made up by argumentation, persuasion, and negotiation phases called dialogue games. I...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} two main contributions: {{the first one}} is specifying the use of argumentative agents in the design and development of communities of Web services; the second is using a formal technique to verify communication protocols against given properties for these communities. Web services that provide a similar functionality are gathered into a single community, independently of their origins, locations, and ways of doing. Associating Web services with argumentative agents that are able to persuade and negotiate with others organizes these Web services in a better way so that they can achieve the goals they set in an efficient way. A community is led by a <b>master</b> <b>component,</b> which is responsible among others for attracting new Web services to the community, retaining existing Web services in the community, and identifying the Web services in the community that will participate in composite scenarios. Besides FIPA-ACL, argumentative dialogue games are also used for agent interaction. In this thesis, we use tableau-based model checking algorithm to verify our argumentative agent-base community of Web services negotiation protocol. This algorithm aims at verifying systems designed as a set of autonomous interacting agents. We provide the soundness, completeness, termination and complexity results. We also simulate our specification with Jadex BDI programming language and implement our verification with a modified and enhanced version of CWB-NC model checker. Keywords.

40|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} participates {{in a variety}} of higher {{cognitive}} functions. The concept of working memory is now widely used to understand prefrontal functions. Neurophysiological studies have revealed that stimulus-selective delay-period activity is a neural correlate of the mechanism for temporarily maintaining information in working memory processes. The central executive, which is the <b>master</b> <b>component</b> of Baddeley’s working memory model and is thought to be a function of the prefrontal cortex, controls the performance of other components by allocating a limited capacity of memory resource to each component based on its demand. Recent neurophysiological studies have attempted to reveal how prefrontal neurons achieve the functions of the central executive. For example, the neural mechanisms of memory control have been examined using the interference effect in a dual-task paradigm. It has been shown that this interference effect is caused by the competitive and overloaded recruitment of overlapping neural populations in the prefrontal cortex by two concurrent tasks and that the information-processing capacity of a single neuron is limited to a fixed level, can be flexibly allocated or reallocated between two concurrent tasks based on their needs, and enhances behavioral performance when its allocation to one task is increased. Further, a metamemory task requiring spatial information has been used to understand the neural mechanism for monitoring its own operations, and {{it has been shown that}} monitoring the quality of spatial information represented by prefrontal activity is an important factor in the subject's choice and that the strength of spatially selective delay-period activity reflects confidence in decision-making. Although further studies are needed to elucidate how the prefrontal cortex controls memory resource and supervises other systems, some important mechanisms related to the central executive have been identified...|$|E

40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} proteins within mammalian cells. PARP- 1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation and is now recognized as a key regulator of cell survival and cell death as well as a <b>master</b> <b>component</b> of a number of transcription factors involved in tumor development and inflammation. PARP- 1 is essential to the repair of DNA single-strand breaks via the base excision repair pathway. Despite many interesting studies that implicate PARP- 1 in transcription, chromatin remodelling, apoptosis, DNA repair and several neurological disorders, its precise role is still unclear. The aim of my studies is represented by the involvement of the PARP- 1 domain, BRCT in the induction of p 53 -dependent apoptotic pathway. The p 53 protein {{is one of the}} most important tumor suppressor proteins. Normally, the p 53 protein is in a latent state. However, in case of DNA damage, nucleotide depletion or hypoxia,when its activity is required, p 53 becomes rapidly activated and initiates transcription of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest-inducing target genes. By means of the aid of T 7 phage display have been the expression of a library of peptides able to bind Phosphopeptides; through biopanning and after several cycle of selection 18 clones were isolated of which 9 phosphopeptides bound p 53, but not able to bind non phosphorilated p 53.
