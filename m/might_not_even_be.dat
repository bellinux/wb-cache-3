Mosasaur fossils have been found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Japan, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Niger, Angola, Morocco, Australia, New Zealand, and on Vega Island off the coast of Antarctica. Tooth taxon Globidens timorensis is known from the island of Timor; however, the phylogenetic {{placement}} of this species is uncertain and it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> a mosasaur. Mosasaurs have been found in Canada in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and in much of the contiguous United States. Complete or partial specimens have been found in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia, as well as in states covered by the Cretaceous seaway: Texas, southwest Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, and the Pierre Shale/Fox Hills formations of North Dakota. Lastly, mosasaur bones and teeth are also known from California, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Chile.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February 1971 {{testimony}} was completed and a verdict expected. However, in March the court advised a settlement, explaining appeals were extremely time consuming. Negotiations began on 22 March and concluded on 24 December, {{three and a}} half years after the case had begun. Nikkatsu paid Suzuki Â¥1000000, a fraction of his original claim, and Hori was forced to apologize for comments he made while serving as president. In a separate agreement Nikkatsu donated Fighting Elegy and Branded to Kill to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. At the time of settlement Suzuki expressed fears that if he had continued to fight he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> able to get an apology from the failing company. During the course of the litigation Nikkatsu was being slowly dismantled. Hori's plans to restructure the company were unsuccessful and Nikkatsu was forced to liquidate studios and headquarter buildings. It released two final films in August 1971 and by November began producing roman poruno, softcore romantic pornography. Despite Suzuki's victory with wide support from the public and film world he was blacklisted by all major production companies and unable to make another film for 10 years.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

500|$|Some {{film critics}} were {{polarized}} with Star Trek. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'B+' grade, and asserted {{that it was}} [...] "a reconsideration of what constitutes Star Trek, one that deemphasizes heady concepts and plainly stated humanist virtues in favor of breathless action punctuated by bursts of emotion. It <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> immediately recognizable to veteran fans." [...] In concurrence, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play with questions of science, ideals or philosophy, {{have been replaced by}} stories reduced to loud and colorful action." [...] Ebert ultimately gave it a [...] 2.5 out of 4 stars. Similarly, Marc Bain of Newsweek opined: [...] "The latest film version of Star Trek [...] is more brawn than brain, and it largely jettisons complicated ethical conundrums in favor of action sequences and special effects. Slate journalist Juliet Lapidos argued that the new film, with its [...] "standard Hollywood torture scene", {{failed to live up to}} the intellectual standard set by the 1992 Next Generation episode [...] "", whose treatment of the issue she found both more sophisticated and pertinent to the ongoing debate over the United States' use of enhanced interrogation techniques.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States {{there are}} {{groups that have}} some degree of {{protection}} for their regional designation. For example, Vidalia onions must be produced within a certain region around Vidalia, Georgia, {{as defined by the}} Georgia Department of Agriculture, and [...] "100% Florida orange juice" [...] is certified as being such by that state's Department of Citrus. Some of these marks are protected in the United States under certification mark law, such as the Idaho Potato Commission's [...] "Idaho" [...] and [...] "Grown in Idaho" [...] registered trademarks for potatoes. Tennessee whiskey is straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee. This definition is legally established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states that Tennessee whiskey is [...] "a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorised to be produced only in the State of Tennessee." [...] There also are cases in which a geographical name has been trademarked for a particular product that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> manufactured there, such as Philadelphia cream cheese. However, because the several states are limited in sovereignty under the United States Constitution, these types of laws are extremely limited in terms of enforcement, except {{to the extent that they}} are backed by various U.S. federal laws.|$|E

60|$|But, {{at about}} the time of High 'Change, Pressure began to wane, and appalling whispers to circulate, east, west, north, and south. At first they were faint, and went no further than a doubt whether Mr Merdle's wealth would be found to be as vast as had been supposed; whether there might not be a {{temporary}} difficulty in 'realising' it; whether there <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> a temporary suspension (say a month or so), {{on the part of the}} wonderful Bank. As the whispers became louder, which they did from that time every minute, they became more threatening. He had sprung from nothing, by no natural growth or process that any one could account for; he had been, after all, a low, ignorant fellow; he had been a down-looking man, and no one had ever been able to catch his eye; he had been taken up by all sorts of people in quite an unaccountable manner; he had never had any money of his own, his ventures had been utterly reckless, and his expenditure had been most enormous. In steady progression, as the day declined, the talk rose in sound and purpose. He had left a letter at the Baths addressed to his physician, and his physician had got the letter, and the letter would be produced at the Inquest on the morrow, and it would fall like a thunderbolt upon the multitude he had deluded. Numbers of men in every profession and trade would be blighted by his insolvency; old people who had been in easy circumstances all their lives would have no place of repentance for their trust in him but the workhouse; legions of women and children would have their whole future desolated by the hand of this mighty scoundrel. Every partaker of his magnificent feasts would be seen to have been a sharer in the plunder of innumerable homes; every servile worshipper of riches who had helped to set him on his pedestal, would have done better to worship the Devil point-blank. So, the talk, lashed louder and higher by confirmation on confirmation, and by edition after edition of the evening papers, swelled into such a roar when night came, as might have brought one to believe that a solitary watcher on the gallery above the Dome of St Paul's would have perceived the night air to be laden with a heavy muttering of the name of Merdle, coupled with every form of execration.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} narrative {{suggested that}} Lim was behind numerous labour disputes that eventually descended into rioting, {{such as the}} Hock Lee riots and the Chinese middle school riots. After the war, the British became more paternalistic towards labour issues, resisting collective bargaining and seeking to depoliticise the labour movement. Without an avenue to seek redress, workers, who were often exploited and underpaid, {{had little choice but}} to fight back through more extreme methods. Lim was arrested and detained on the charge that he masterminded the riots, although the speech he made <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have <b>been</b> inflammatory.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, a {{legal battle}} ensued between The Academy and Buddy Rogers's heirs over {{the sale of the}} Coquette Oscar. The heirs were trying to sell the award for charity, as stipulated in Rogers's second wife's will.

They claimed that when she won her honorary Oscar in the 1970s she signed a {{contract}} covering the Coquette statuette as well. The heirs argued that it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>even</b> <b>been</b> her signature, as Pickford was frail {{at the end of her}} life.|$|R
60|$|She {{left him}} a little impatiently, and Aynesworth joined {{the outside of the}} circle of men who had {{gathered}} round Wingrave.

He was quite aware that he occupied in society the one unique place to which princes <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> aspire--there <b>was</b> something of divinity about his millions, something of awe in the tone of the men with whom he talked. Women pretended to be interested in him because of the romance of his suddenly acquired wealth--the men did not trouble to deceive themselves or anyone else. A break up of the group came when a certain great and much-talked-about lady sent across an imperative message by her cavalier for the moment. She desired that Mr. Wingrave should be presented to her.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework and an initial study in general video game level generation, {{the problem of}} generating levels for not only a single game but for any game within a specified domain.

The framework presented here builds on the General Video Game AI framework (GVG-AI) and the Video Game Description Language (VGDL), in order to reap synergies from research activities connected to the General Video Game Playing Competition. The framework will also form the basis for a new track of this competition. In addition to the framework, the paper presents three general level generators and an empirical comparison of their qualities...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the section}} above points out, the naming {{practices}} of the time were often inconsistent. Two dances with the same name may not necessarily share the same origin story or even look alike. Carolina shag and St Louis shag, two dances that both became popular in the late 1940s and 50s, provide {{a perfect example of}} this complication. Both came to be called [...] "shag", though they have very different origin stories. So, although {{it is possible that the}} dance that Lewis Hall and his partner invented somehow gave rise to the shag of the swing era (i.e., what we call [...] "collegiate shag" [...] today), this possibility could also be granted to a number of other seemingly unrelated dances from the late 1920s or early 1930s, some of which <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>even</b> <b>been</b> called shag.|$|R

50|$|As {{soon as you}} {{dive into}} the old town {{from any of the}} entrances from the modern city, you dive into a maze of alleys, a {{labyrinth}} of small streets with arches, with shops, with mosques and churches, with arches and remnants of the old defensive wall, with restaurants hidden behind small doors. From every corner, the age of the houses dawns on you. It is actually quite easy to imagine that life <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have <b>been</b> very different here many centuries ago.Sometimes alleys are so tight that you can just walk inside without touching the walls. Some alleys are covered by vines, giving them a distinctly village-like appearance. Despite all the winding little streets, the many side streets and small squares, it is somehow impossible to get lost there - sooner or later you find yourself near one of the landmarks.

Furthermore, since ratio distributions can be difficult to handle, and in particular, moments <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> defined at all [20, 21], a reference experiment normalization can considerably complicate this kind of sensitivity analysis. At least, convergence has to be checked carefully for a Monte Carlo implementation of the method.|$|R
