2500|$|Cities also {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. [...] This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. [...] <b>Multi-generational</b> <b>poverty</b> found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. [...] In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high income neighborhoods touches 20 years.|$|E
50|$|By 2001 {{suffering}} major {{losses of}} tax revenue, McDowell County public schools {{had fallen into}} physical decay and high rates of academic failure. Enrollments declined, {{more than half of}} the children lived in poverty. The West Virginia Department of Education intervened in December, 2001, by taking over the county system, instituting emergency funding and reorganization. The state effectively repaired or closed several school buildings, and launched construction of crucial new facilities. The consolidation of former schools into new locations, however, created new problems of busing students longer distances over narrow, winding mountain roads. New programs of teacher training aided local educators in addressing issues of <b>multi-generational</b> <b>poverty</b> in McDowell County families. Often the school system had to work at educating and stimulating hope in two or more generations at a time. With the help of the state, the county school system has now returned to self-governance.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout American {{history the}} Poor Whites have {{regularly}} {{been referred to}} by various terms; the majority of which are often considered disparaging. They have been known as rednecks (especially in modern context), hillbillies in Appalachia, [...] crackers in Georgia, and poor white trash. In the past {{the use of the}} term [...] "Poor White" [...] by the white Southern elite, who considered it an oxymoron, was to distance themselves from elements of society they viewed as [...] "undesirable", [...] "lesser" [...] or [...] "antisocial." [...] It denoted a separation, reflective of a social hierarchy, with [...] "poor" [...] used to demonstrate a low position, while [...] "white" [...] was used to subjugate rather than to classify. Author Wayne Flynt in his book, Dixie's Forgotten People: The South's Poor Whites (2004), argues that [...] "one difficulty in defining poor whites stems from the diverse ways in which the phrase has been used. It has been applied to economic and social classes as well to cultural and ethical values." [...] While other regions of the United States have white people who are poor, this does not have the same meaning as the Poor White in the South. In context, the Poor White refers to a distinct sociocultural group, with members who belong to families with a history of <b>multi-generational</b> <b>poverty</b> and cultural divergence.|$|E

Such problematic drug use {{has been found to be}} concentrated in Dublin's inner city areas and outer estates where <b>poverty,</b> <b>multi-generational</b> unemployment, high population density (particularly of young adults), and poor facilities are the norm.

40|$|This paper {{looked at}} the {{development}} of problematic illicit drug use and the responses of policy makers and local communities. It drew on existing research and on the initial results from {{a study of the}} environmental aspects of problematic drug use. The author stated that such drug use, and in particular the misuse of opiates, had been identified as a major social problem in Ireland. It was found to be concentrated in Dublin's inner city areas and outer estates where <b>poverty,</b> <b>multi-generational</b> unemployment, high population density and poor facilities were the norm. The author suggested that policy responses to the issue tended to focus mainly on the medical treatment of the individual, rather than on wider social and economic factors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how federally sponsored research questions about welfare policy have evolved from 1981 to 2001, through a {{content analysis of}} Requests for Proposals (RFPs). We treat the RFP as a document that identifies what information is sought {{as well as what}} is treated as established knowledge. Results show that research questions represent a mixture of constancy and change. The greatest similarity in research questions is in the areas of employment and earnings/income, with greater variability in the areas of family formation and child outcomes. The research questions, notwithstanding their sophisticated terminology, often boil down to who the poor are, how welfare recipients can be coaxed or forced into the labor market, whether fundamental work supports such as health insurance and reliable childcare are helpful in sustaining employment, and whether welfare is implicated in pregnancy, marital behavior and <b>multi-generational</b> <b>poverty.</b> We interpret these findings in relation to concepts on research utilization.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} acknowledgement of and {{concern over the}} growing social stratification in our society. This bifurcation is demonstrated in the widening gap between the wealthy and impoverished. A college degree is an especially critical asset in helping to break <b>multi-generational</b> cycles of <b>poverty.</b> Unfortunately, low-income and first-generation college students face daunting obstacles on their paths to college graduation. First-generation status and low-income status are each negative predictors of college success. This is a study focused on the success, as defined by persistence to graduation, of first-generation students from low-income backgrounds. It introduces faculty, college administrators, and policy makers to students from this background at a rural New England public college who were close to completing their college degrees. The research questions were (a) to what factors the students attributed their success, (b) what oncampus programs or services were helpful in leading to that success, and (c) how could factors identified as leading to success among these students be leveraged to assist the success of other students in this population? Criterion sampling {{was used to determine}} an eligible cohort. The three criteria identified were (a) first-generation status, (b) low-income background, and (c) likelihood of graduation, based on accumulated credits. Through qualitative interviewing I learned from these students to what they attributed their success. This research approach enabled me to gain in-depth information on the personal backgrounds of the individual students interviewed. The participants’ narratives – their life stories – drove the study. Extended quotes from respondents were compiled. Narrative analysis was used to code the data. Major themes that emerged included (a) the critical significance of faculty, (b) the value of support services, (c) the importance of flexibility in course requirements and delivery methods as well as program requirements, (d) the high value placed on positive reinforcement and feedback as a positive motivator, and (e) {{the ways in which the}} challenging aspects of their backgrounds, misunderstood as deficits (e. g., unvalued social and cultural capital), helped them to develop strengths instrumental to their success. The resulting recommendations focus on areas where the data indicated that institutional interventions could increase the likelihood of college retention and success. These include (a) better utilizing pre-arrival materials and programs as anticipatory socialization opportunities, (b) maximizing first-year celebratory socialization initiatives, (c) providing targeted support based on student background traits, (d) instituting faculty training and development focused on how their role and teaching styles affect student success, (e) reviewing strategies for informing students of services, and (f) leveraging the desire of students to assist their peers who have not yet realized their level of success. The hope is that the resulting knowledge gained will inform future practice as well as assist higher education faculty and staff to work toward the success of this student population...|$|R
