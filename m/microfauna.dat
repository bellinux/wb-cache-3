5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of <b>microfauna</b> in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and <b>microfauna</b> and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day.

Above the margaritae subzone, large fusulinas are absent and, in our interpretation, replaced by smaller foraminifera of Upper Permian age (Djulfian s. I.).

40|$|Exceptionally rich Permian fusulinid assemblages, varying in {{age from}} Yakhtashian to Dzhulfian, were found in {{reworked}} limestone blocks from conglomerates of the Aseelah Unit, recently defined in the Batain Plain and dated possibly as Upper Triassic. This paper only deals with the Middle Permian, Midian (= Capitanian) <b>microfaunas</b> from the conglomerates.

The Qarari Unit is interpreted as a hemipelagic series deposited on the distal slope of the Arabian carbonate platform. The Midian foraminifers from the Batain Plain are similar to some assemblages of Transcaucasia, of the Abadeh area (Iran), of SW Turkey (Taurus Mountains), and some, especially the Neoschwagerinidae, exhibit affinities with <b>microfaunas</b> of the eastern Tethys terranes of Japan.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{describes}} the fluctuation pattern in Late Holocene microfaunal (i. e. foraminifera and ostracods) and nannofloral assemblages of two cores {{collected from the}} Romanian Black Sea shelf, at a water depth of 28 and 66 m, respectively. The lithology of the cores is mainly characterised by blackish muds, alternating with thin, centimetres-thick sand and coquina layers. The <b>microfaunas</b> are dominated by brackish foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages that are still common in the actual Black Sea communities, living nowadays at water salinity lower than 18 ‰. In the shallower water Site EF 08 - 01, the abundance ratio between Caspian and Mediterranean ostracods is 0. 7, while in the deeper water Site BS 08 - 055, the abundance ratio between Caspian and Mediterranean ostracods is 0. 01. These data argue for the dominance of Mediterranean ostracod fauna with lower abundance in shallower environments of the Black Sea and with a very high abundance in the deeper parts of the internal shelf, i. e., at a water depth of 66 m. Based on the calcareous nannoplankton fluctuation, four Nannofloral Intervals were identified, which indicate a gradual salinity increase of the surface waters during the deposition of the Late Holocene Shallow Unit. In the same interval, the benthic <b>microfaunas</b> (ostracods and foraminifers) argue for a more stable salinity environment in the two studied cores from the Black Sea inner shelf...|$|R

An overview of the cored Lower Cretaceous sections of Leg 1 - 80 is given.

The Hauterivian-Aptian interval is characterized by zones of Gavelinella barrerniana, Gaudryina dividens, and Conorotalites aptiensis. During the Albian a world-wide fauna consisting of agglutinated and calcareous foraminifers of the Pseudoclavulina gaultina Zone is established in areas lacking the wide-spread black-shale conditions. The Upper Albian and the Cenomanian are represented by the Gavelinella eenomanica Zone. Some ornamented species of the nodosariids (Citharina, Lenticulina), Gavelinella, Conorotatites, Pleurostomella, Vatvulineria, and Osangularia are of some importance for the biostratigraphy of the Berriasian-Albian interval. The Berriasian to Albian zones introduced for the Tethys and the DSDP by Moullade (1984) could only be of some local importance due to the long stratigraphical range of the foraminiferal species used. In the Indian Ocean an exact stratigraphical age cannot be assigned to the few Neocomian foraminiferal faunas of a cooler sea water (Site 261). These faunas mainly contain primitive agglutinated foraminifers, because {{in most cases the}} calcareous tests are dissolved or redeposited. In the Pacific Ocean most of the Berriasian to Aptian <b>microfaunas</b> are of minor biostratigraphical and palaeoecological importance for reasons of poor core recoveries, contaminations or original foraminiferal poverty (black shales). Since the Albian there are somewhat higher-diverse faunas of calcareous and agglutinated foraminifers with index species of the Pseudoclavulina gaultina Zone. As a rule, the boundary Albian/Cenomanian is set by means of planktonic foraminifers because no other foraminifer has its first appearance datum during this interval, except Gavelinella cenornanica.
