25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always having you here by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet, So don't underestimate <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view." ...|$|E
50|$|Let Simon Decide {{currently}} offers three {{decision making}} tools that take between 5 and 10 minutes to use: My Scores, My Life Match, and <b>My</b> <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> View. <b>My</b> Scores {{is the most}} logical, fact-based tool, ideal for decisions where the user faces multiple appealing alternatives and factors. The user is asked to list their alternatives, list the factors {{that are important to}} their decision, rank these factors in order of importance, and score each alternative against each factor. My Life Match is the most personal tool and considers the user's goals, current situation, personality type, and activities, based on the My Life Profile the user has created. <b>My</b> <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> View is the fastest decision tool and prompts the user to consider his/her decision from four different perspectives.|$|R

Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point."

500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others.

There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best {{is one of the few}} murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|E

Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories.

[...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

[...] Clarke culled [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] from her incipient novel. [...] Greenland {{was so impressed with}} the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying from <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano {{for the first time and}} she plays a sonata." [...] Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.|$|E

500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. What could any kid say at that point?

500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
