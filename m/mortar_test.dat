Geological study can identify various rock types, geological structures, and reactive minerals which contribute to Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR).

At the beginning of immersion(0 year), corrosion potentials exhibited increasingly nobler value with increasing the cover thickness. However, after being immersed for 5 years, the corrosion potentials conversely shifted in the positive direction with decreasing the cover thickness. As a result, the relationships between corrosion potential and cover thickness were not in good agreement with each other after 5 years.

The compressive strength and modulus of rupture were almost twice the values declared by the manufacturer. Tendencies {{with respect to the}} relationship between compressive strength and the mentioned test parameters were as expected. Shear and bending tests on masonry made with the <b>tested</b> <b>mortar</b> were also performed and the results compared. Due to the relatively large variation in mechanical properties, no significant relationship between the strength of small scale specimens and larger test walls was found. Variation of properties in one wall was similar to the variation over a number of walls that were made in a one-year period...|$|R
