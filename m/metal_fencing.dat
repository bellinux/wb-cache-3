5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down <b>metal</b> <b>fencing.</b> The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{continues}} {{to support the}} Washington Aqueduct, {{as well as a}} roadway, MacArthur Boulevard. Traffic is narrowed to one lane with traffic signals controlling traffic in either direction.

Signs remind city crews not to salt the roadway in winter months.|$|E
25|$|Sideshow Alley {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the exhibition grounds and is bound by Bowen Bridge Road on the west, Bowen Park on the northwest, Show Ring No.2 to the northeast and the railway line to the southeast. The site is enclosed by a combination of fencing types which include timber framed fencing with corrugated iron cladding to Bowen Park and the railway boundaries, masonry to the Bowen Bridge Road frontage and new infill sections of <b>metal</b> <b>fencing</b> to other areas. The sense of enclosure to this part of the site is further heightened by its sunken level, relative to its surrounds and the close proximity of the Old Museum Building, the John MacDonald Stand, the mature vegetation of Bowen Park and the towering structures of the neighbouring Royal Brisbane Hospital.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, an MMA {{competition}} or exhibition may {{be held in}} a ring or a fenced area. The fenced area can be round or have at least six sides.

The fenced area is called a cage generically, or a hexagon, an octagon or an octagon cage, depending on the shape.|$|E
2500|$|The 1954 Pageant of Peace {{was held}} on December 17, 1954. The Ellipse became {{the site of the}} National Community Christmas Tree, and cut trees were used because Park Service {{officials}} felt that a living tree would interfere with the various cultural and recreational events on the Ellipse at other times of the year. The [...] "pageant of peace" [...] theme was intended to echo the words of the angels ("Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men") during the Annunciation to the shepherds as found in the Authorized King James Version of the New Testament. Most of the goods and services which made the event possible were donated: [...] Local architect Leon Chatelain, Jr., designed the site; Michigan State College provided the tree; the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railway gave the transportation to get the tree to D.C.; Pepco supplied the Christmas lights and power; Hargrove Display Decorators provided the nativity scene; the peace symbols, plaques, and trees for the [...] "Pathway of Peace" [...] were given by 27 U.S. states and territories and 23 embassies; and the reindeer stalls, <b>metal</b> <b>fencing,</b> stage, and wooden walkways were provided by the National Park Service.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{materials}} available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams {{to create a}} framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on {{the thickness of the}} adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a <b>metal</b> <b>fencing</b> or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the <b>metal</b> <b>fencing</b> like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.|$|E
