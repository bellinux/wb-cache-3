5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not <b>muffle</b> sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to <b>muffle,</b> but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to <b>muffle</b> the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Muffling</b> {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same <b>muffling</b> techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly <b>muffled</b> by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more <b>muffled</b> tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed <b>muffling.</b> The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|R

5|$|Urquhart {{formulated}} his {{withdrawal plan}} on the successful method {{used in the}} evacuation of Gallipoli during the First World War. The northernmost units would fall back first, moving through the more southerly groups who would then follow behind. The Glider Pilots would organise the routes {{to the river and}} the whole operation would be covered by an intense artillery barrage from XXX Corps. South of the river the evacuation was organised and staffed by men of the Royal Engineers of 43rd Division and Royal Canadian Engineers, using rafts and storm boats. In order to prevent the Germans from learning about the operation, the plan was not announced until the afternoon and some men (mainly wounded) would remain to lay covering fire through the night. Men were ordered to <b>muffle</b> their boots and weapons to help them bypass known German incursions into the perimeter. Some men took the opportunity to shave before withdrawing, providing quite a morale boost.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>muffles</b> of the {{concentration}} camp ovens were smaller that those for civil crematoria, because no {{space for a}} coffin was needed, which saved both space and fuel. Prüfer later designed ovens with <b>muffles</b> large enough for multiple bodies to be burned similtaneously. Later, in Topf & Söhne's instructions on using the ovens, they advised adding bodies to the <b>muffles</b> at 20 minute intervals as the previous body burned down. Bodies were often pushed in four, five or even six at once.|$|R

25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them <b>muffle</b> the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to <b>muffle</b> the overtones even more. And drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|E

50|$|Glasspacks are an old, simple, and {{relatively}} inexpensive muffler design that are effective at reducing back pressure, {{but not very}} effective at <b>muffling</b> noise. A longer glasspack will reduce noise {{to a greater extent}} than a shorter one. Sound is also dissipated into the fiberglass damping material. Other glasspack mufflers have perforated louvers punched into the center core which can reduce total flow capacity. The turbulence created by the perforated louvers therefore achieves greater <b>muffling</b> capacity at the expense of total volume of air flow. The more turbulence created, the greater the <b>muffling</b> & less total air flow / power production capacity. Depending on the directionality of the louvers, one can choose between slightly higher flow capacity or slightly greater <b>muffling.</b> This lower flow but slightly quieter design approach is commonly used in glasspack mufflers.|$|R

25|$|The fuses in {{the shells}} {{proved to be}} unreliable, {{with the result that}} many of the shells {{exploded}} prematurely. To eliminate the problem, on the second and subsequent days of the bombardment, Porter ordered that all fuses should be cut to full length. The shells therefore hit the ground before exploding; they would sink into the soft earth, which would then <b>muffle</b> the effects of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Since timpani {{have a long}} sustain, {{muffling}} or dampening is {{an inherent}} part of playing. Often, timpanists will <b>muffle</b> notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.|$|E
25|$|Typical ways to <b>muffle</b> a snare or tom include placing {{an object}} {{on the outer}} edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of mylar are common objects. Also used are {{external}} clip-on muffles that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.|$|E
5000|$|Putting {{a pillow}} inside the drum (for bass drums). The amount of <b>muffling</b> is {{controlled}} by {{how much of the}} pillow touches the front or rear heads; the less contact, the less <b>muffling.</b> Some companies produce dedicated bass drum mufflers that look like odd-shaped pillows; these work in the same fashion.|$|R

25|$|There were secret {{staircases}} {{and hidden}} spaces which {{were used to}} overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was especially designed to <b>muffle</b> {{the cries of the}} victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down. In a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them.|$|E
25|$|At 6:30a.m. on April 16, {{the body}} of a 13-year-old schoolgirl named Dawn Louise Basom was found {{discarded}} beside a desolate road in Ypsilanti. Clothed only in a white blouse and bra, which had been pushed around her neck, she had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and genitals, had received multiple slash wounds across the breasts, buttocks and stomach, then strangled to death with a two-foot length electrical flex still knotted around her neck. A handkerchief found stuffed in her mouth had likely been placed there to <b>muffle</b> her cries throughout her torture, and her murderer had placed her body in a location where rapid discovery was assured.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} ways to properly <b>muffle</b> a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced or {{do not know how}} much foam to apply, the person should apply it to the outside of the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, make a note of how much foam was applied for future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed on the drum. This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E

A medical examination revealed Beineman had been extensively beaten about the face and body, with some lacerations inflicted being so severe sections of skin had been removed, exposing subcutaneous tissues. She had received extensive skull and brain injuries which had been inflicted with a blunt instrument, {{had been forced to}} ingest a caustic substance, and her neck, shoulders, nipples and breasts had been burned with the same caustic agent. As had been the case with previous victims, her killer had placed a section of cloth in her throat to <b>muffle</b> her screams throughout her torture.|$|E
25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to <b>muffle</b> the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E
25|$|Initial assault movement. Movement to {{the target}} area was {{typically}} by long, roundabout routes to conceal the mission and fool enemy observation. Once they had reached the target, infiltrators in the advance units spread themselves around the perimeter according to their assigned tasks. Detailed prior reconnaissance helped in this effort. They strapped weapons and explosive charges to their bodies to minimize noise as they maneuvered through the outer band of fortifications, and often covered their bodies in charcoal and grease to aid movement and make detection more difficult. Barbed wire was sometimes only cut partially, with the remaining strands broken by hand to <b>muffle</b> the tell-tale “snip” of wire-cutters. Tripflares were neutralized by wrapping their triggers with cloth or strips of bamboo carried {{in the teeth of}} the vanguard fighters. Claymore mines might be turned in another direction.|$|E
