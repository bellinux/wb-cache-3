40|$|Motherhood and {{professional}} achievements appear as conflicting goals even for academic women. This project explores this tension {{by focusing on}} a set of provisions on parental and <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves</b> across 165 higher education institutions in the UK. Generous maternity provisions generate countervailing incentives for female academics. On the one hand, advantageous policies can foster women’s productivity in terms of research outcomes allowing them to take time out of work without income and career break concerns. On the other hand, women can exploit generous provisions without generating returnable results for the academic institution. We argue that adverse selection problems lead universities to differentiate among academic staff by offering two different types of maternity provisions (more vs less generous <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves)</b> in order to “test” women’s commitment and research ability before offering permanent contracts. Our results support this this line of argumentation. We also find that generous <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves</b> and childcare provisions positively affect the number of women at research and professorship levels...|$|R

5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous <b>maternity</b> <b>leave</b> was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E

40|$|Female {{employment}} {{rates in}} Russia have declined substantially {{since the end}} of the Soviet period. At the same time, there has been pronounced change in policies enabling women to balance work and family, or “familial policies. ” The availability of child care has contracted sharply, and long <b>maternity</b> and parental <b>leaves</b> have been introduced. This paper describes these changes within the context of Russia in transition, and explores the effect of child care and leave policy on women’s employment using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. We conclude that, over the longer-term, women are more likely to remain employed if they work for enterprises which provide child care and <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves.</b> Yet new, private enterprises are less likely to provide such leaves, painting a somewhat bleak picture of the long-term employment prospects for women in Russia.

5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for <b>maternity</b> <b>leave</b> than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for <b>maternity</b> <b>leave</b> than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, <b>maternity</b> <b>leave</b> was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{paper is}} aimed at {{indicating}} {{the similarities and differences}} in use of benefits supporting work–life balance (WLB) between women and men working in Polish small/medium and large enterprises. Material and Methods: The sample included 556 workers (311 women, 245 men), aged 20 – 68 years old employed on the basis of employment contracts {{for at least a year}} in Polish enterprises. The respondents completed a questionnaire on the use of benefits guaranteed by the Polish Labour Code, referring to their current workplaces. Results: Women took <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves</b> and returned to the same work position after using childcare leaves more often than men. Men took leaves on demand more often than women. Our results also showed that in comparison to women working in smaller enterprises, those working in large enterprises were more likely to use almost all the analyzed WLB benefits – paid days off to take care of others, educational leaves, <b>leaves</b> on demand, <b>maternity</b> <b>leaves</b> and return to the same work position after childcare leave, reduction of business trips when pregnant or having young children and breastfeeding breaks. The size of enterprise, however, did not differentiate the take-up of benefits among the studied men. Conclusions: Our analysis brought unexpected results on the lack of common availability of the WLB benefits guaranteed by the law in the case of employees who worked on the basis of employment contracts. We also found that women used most of child rearing benefits guaranteed by the law more often than men, which might reflect still a traditional division of child care responsibilities in Poland.
