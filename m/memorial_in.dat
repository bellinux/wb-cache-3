5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} {{memorial}} to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927.

Other memorials followed: the Helles <b>Memorial</b> <b>in</b> Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra <b>Memorial</b> <b>in</b> Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren.

The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval <b>Memorial</b> <b>in</b> 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
