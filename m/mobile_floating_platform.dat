They preferred another area and then gave a formal and written permission to launch from the military firing range ESD138/ESD139, which {{is located on the}} position [...] in the Baltic Sea.It is just outside Nexø on the Danish island of Bornholm and is therefore nicknamed Spaceport Nexø. The CS then had to build a <b>floating</b> <b>mobile</b> launcher <b>platform</b> (MLP), called Sputnik after the Russian spacecraft which was the first artificial satellite to be put into orbit.Their launch campaigns includes the following ships: ...|$|R

40|$|Stability of the <b>mobile</b> <b>floating</b> harbor is an {{important}} criterion to avoid an accident in port operation during lifting, loading, and uploading container. The stability of a <b>mobile</b> <b>floating</b> harbor which completed with a container crane was analyzed by study the structure’s rolling amplitude at several sea conditions. Factors considered in the study as follows: size and height of crane {{and the location of}} the container during loading and unloading. The <b>mobile</b> <b>floating</b> harbor was constructed using a semi-submersible model on a scale of 1 : 70 with a specified gantry crane with maximum outreach length 65 meters (Actual size). Using the model, inclining test, swing and oscillating tests was carried out to obtain hydrostatic particulars. By using the experimental result, the roll amplitude for several sea conditions was simulated using the Morison equation. The simulation results showed that the highest roll amplitude occurs when the crane for <b>mobile</b> <b>floating</b> harbor loaded with container in any sea condition...|$|R

40|$|Deep-sea <b>floating</b> <b>platforms</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} large structures for ocean energy exploitation. A new energy-absorbing device named S-shaped Tuned Liquid Column Damper (TLCD) has been invented for the suppression of the horizontal motion and vertical in-plane rotation of a deep-sea <b>floating</b> <b>platform.</b> A conventional tuned liquid column damper has a U-shaped water tunnel to absorb the excessive energy of the main structure. The application of U-shaped dampers in deep-sea <b>floating</b> <b>platforms</b> is difficult due to the restriction of a large horizontal length. A novel S-shaped damper is proposed to retain the same amount of liquid using a shorter S-shaped tunnel. Theoretical and experimental works are conducted and prove that an S-shaped damper needs less than half the horizontal length to provide the same suppression as a U-shaped damper. A coupling calculation model is proposed and followed by the sensitivity analysis. The study demonstrates the applicability of the novel S-shaped damper for the motion suppression in deep-sea <b>floating</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|The New Headquarters of Shenzhen Stock Exchange (NHSSE), {{currently}} being constructed in Shenzhen, China, is a high-rise {{building with a}} height of 245 m. One salient feature of NHSSE is its huge <b>floating</b> <b>platform</b> with an overall plan dimension of 98 m × 162 m and a total height of 24 m, {{making it one of}} the largest cantilever structures in the world. In recognition of the uniqueness of the <b>floating</b> <b>platform,</b> a long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) system has been designed and implemented by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for both in-construction and in-service monitoring of NHSSE. As part of this monitoring system, 224 vibrating-wire strain gauges have been permanently installed to measure the strain responses of key structural components of the <b>floating</b> <b>platform.</b> A wireless strain monitoring system by integrating local tethered data acquisition and long-range wireless data transmission has been developed for real-time strain monitoring and visualization.
