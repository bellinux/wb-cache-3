5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 {{which is likely to}} have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also {{been compared to}} other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E

60|$|In {{justice to}} a very {{hard-working}} class, {{it must be said}} that the thieves of Upper India have the keenest sense of humour. The last compliment that they can pay a Police officer is to rob him, and if, as once they did, they can loot a Deputy Inspector-General of Police, {{on the eve of his}} retirement, of everything except the clothes on his back, their joy is complete. They cause letters of derision and telegrams of condolence to be sent to the victim; for of all men, thieves are <b>most</b> <b>compelled</b> to keep up with modern progress.|$|R
5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the reasons}} Lori and Corey found for {{creating}} a bridge between Trial by Fire and Shadows of Darkenss, the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> was {{the feeling that the}} Hero character simply hadn't matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.|$|E

As a teacher, I desire to develop a vocal pedagogy that will instill commercial music singers with the proper technique, instruction, and tools for vocal care that will maximize their performance and also increase the longevity of their careers. As a singer, I want to ensure that my own vocal technique is sound. For {{the majority of my}} formal education in music, I have studied classical music with these goals in mind. This project was a 60 minute recital that was an exploration of taking classical music techniques and applying them to the genres of musical theatre, jazz, pop/country, R&B, and spirituals, while focusing on creating performances that were not only vocally and musically dynamic and appropriate, but authentic in every aspect. This process will guide me in the development of my own vocal pedagogy...|$|R

25|$|The {{threat of}} the Arabs from Arabia was {{overlooked}} by both Persia and Byzantium for several reasons— <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> of all were the wars between the two powers, {{and the lack of}} communication across the desert expanse.

25|$|Pre-existing {{disadvantage}} {{asks whether}} there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In Corbiere v.

25|$|She {{sent her}} first-person {{account of this}} {{experience}} months later to her sister Esther without rereading it, and it {{remains one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> early accounts of a mastectomy. It is impossible to know today whether the breast removed was indeed cancerous or whether she suffered from mastopathy. She survived and returned to England in 1812 to visit her ailing father and to avoid young Alexander's conscription into the French army, while still in recovery from her own illness.|$|E

Though the painting's unusual composition was noted from its earliest viewings, initially its subject was interpreted simply as that of girls at play, but it has subsequently been viewed in more abstract terms, reflecting Freudian analysis and a greater interest in the ambiguities of adolescence.|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{received}} {{funding from the}} European Union Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement 283871. We comment on a recent behavioral study in which we describe a human-like beckoning gesture in 2 groups of bonobos, used in combination with sexual solicitation postures. The beckoning gesture fulfils key criteria of deixis and iconicity, in that it communicates to a distant recipient the desired travel path {{in relation to a}} specific social intention, i. e., to have sex at another location. We discuss this finding {{in light of the fact}} that, despite the documented great ape capacity and obvious communicative advantage, referential gestures are still surprisingly rare in their natural communication. We address several possibilities for this peculiar underuse and are <b>most</b> <b>compelled</b> by the notion that non-human primates are generally not very motivated to share their experiences of external objects or events with others, which removes most reasons for referential signaling.

25|$|Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> {{reason for}} {{increasing}} the emphasis on this southern drive {{had more to do}} with the actions of Americans than those of Germans. While Montgomery was carefully and cautiously planning for the main thrust in the north, complete with massive artillery preparation and an airborne assault, American forces in the south were displaying the kind of basic aggressiveness that Eisenhower wanted to see. On 7 March, Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges's U.S. 1st Army captured the last intact bridge over the Rhine at Remagen and steadily expanded the bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{into his}} 17th {{professional}} {{season as a}} 42-year-old, Turner's game attire was still a black headband, black sleeve, black shoes and black socks—a tradition dating back to his high school days. Turner's original swag was still on display to make him the game's <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> figure. Turner was captivated as a youth by the audacity of Michigan's Fab Five, basketball's first hip-hop stars. As a teenager, Turner modelled his appearance and game on them, and {{a quarter of a}} century on, their attitude and aggression still informed his game. On October 8, 2016, in the third game of the 2016–17 season, Turner rolled back the years with a season-best 45 points to help Killester defeat Moycullen 83–74.|$|E

G4TV editor Michael Leffler called her a wonderful addition to the series, adding that she balances Link out. Nintendo Power, in discussing the ending to Twilight Princess, describes the relationship between Link and Midna as one of the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> in The Legend of Zelda history. IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas refers to her as essentially the second playable character in Twilight Princess.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{describes}} one {{genre of}} contemporary anti-immigrant rhetoric, examines {{the social and}} economic forces that engender that rhetoric, and delineates its implications for the national debate about health care reform. The Article details the underlying significance of America 2 ̆ 7 s opaque, yet highly competitive, class system to immigration reform and to health care reform. It locates the population <b>most</b> <b>compelled</b> by anti-immigrant rhetoric in the so-called intermediate strata (more generally referred to as the lower middle class). Careful examination of the relevant rhetoric suggests a broad explanation of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance, over almost a century, to construct a system of universal or near-universal health care coverage. In supporting its claims, the Article examines the remarkable story of Luis Jimenez, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant who was deported to Guatemala at the expense and initiative of a Florida hospital; further, it examines a number of recent federal and state laws that preclude or significantly limit health care benefits for undocumented (and for many documented) immigrants...|$|R

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>compelling</b> story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E
