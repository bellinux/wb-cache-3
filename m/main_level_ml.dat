50|$|The new Central Bus Station has {{two levels}} of {{underground}} parking, three <b>main</b> <b>levels,</b> and five upper floors of office space. The first <b>main</b> <b>level</b> is a shopping concourse and food court. The second <b>main</b> <b>level</b> serves as both a shopping concourse and the arrivals hall for incoming intercity bus passengers. Since the building is constructed {{on the side of}} a hill, the first and second <b>main</b> <b>levels</b> both have a ground-level entrance/exit to Jaffa Road. Besides retail stores, the concourse includes bakery outlets, a video game parlor, and free-standing gift sellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{south side}} of the house was {{accessible}} via a door on the ground level, and on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> by a pair of matching spiral staircases. The paired spiral stairs were unique to this area but not extraordinary in Palladio’s designs. The grand room on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> opened to a porch with flat, parapeted flat roof. The <b>main</b> <b>level</b> entrances on both the north and south sides of the central block were three panel double-doors with glazed sidelight sashes.|$|R

These checkpoints, however, can only be reached in the same play session. If the player quits the game, {{they will have to}} start at the beginning of one of the 3 <b>main</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

40|$|Definition of a Multi <b>Level</b> (<b>ML)</b> Method We {{begin with}} an {{abstract}} definition of a multi <b>level</b> (<b>ML)</b> method for {{the solution of the}} linear system of equations Ax = b: The notation of this definition will be useful in the sequel. In the following, S is a smoothing procedure and ffl, r, t and o are nonnegative integers denoting, respectively, the cycle index, the number of presmoothings, the number of postsmoothings and the minimal order of A for which ML is called recursively. The operators R (restriction), P (prolongation) and Q (coarse grid coefficient matrix) will be defined later. ML(x in; A; b; x out) : if A is of order ! o x out / A Γ 1 b otherwise: x in / Sx in (repeat r times). e / 0 (1) ML(e; Q; R(Ax in Γ b); e out) e / e out) repeat ffl times x out / x in Γ P e x out / Sx out (repeat t times).

25|$|The New England barn {{is from a}} {{different}} tradition than the Pennsylvania Barn. In New England the barn doors are always on the gable end. The cows were on the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> hay in a mow on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> and/or above in haylofts, possibly grain storage on the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> sometimes a tack room or workshop and the basement was used for manure management and other tasks. The New England barn developed in the early 19th century, became the most popular barn type after 1850 replacing the smaller, side-entry English barn and are almost always square rule framing.|$|R

50|$|In 1773 {{an upper}} navigable level {{was created by}} {{widening}} the original drainage sough with a finished length of 1.75 mi and draining into the <b>main</b> navigable <b>level.</b> A sloped branch was driven from the upper level to the surface at a gradient of 1 in 4 to allow boats to be drawn up and lowered down. This incline was later continued downwards to the <b>main</b> <b>level.</b> Further navigable levels were dug below the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> to serve deeper seams; these were 57 yd and 83 yd deeper.|$|R
25|$|In August 1974, {{construction}} of the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored {{to the top of}} the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> as well as a base for the {{construction of}} the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{terms such as}} 'line-up level' and 'operating level' exist, and their meaning may vary from place to place. In an attempt bring clarity to level {{definitions}} {{in the context of}} programme transmission from one country to another, where different technical practices may apply, ITU-R Rec. BS.645 defined three reference levels: Measurement <b>Level</b> (<b>ML),</b> Alignment <b>Level</b> (AL) and Permitted Maximum Level (PML). This document shows the reading corresponding to these levels for several types of meter. Alignment Level is the level of a steady sine-wave alignment tone. Permitted Maximum Level refers to the permitted maximum meter indication that operators should aim for on speech, music etc., not tone.|$|R
