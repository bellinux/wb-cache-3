40|$|Le Corbusier's {{method of}} {{creating}} Architecture in all {{regions of the}} world is endlessly rich in techniques. While it is impossible to exactly know his thoughts as he created his modern compositions that skillfully addressed contextual cues, I present a thesis of how Corbusier approached different sites and masterfully created residences that were places "where happiness is born". I will use Shape Grammars and formulate <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>languages</b> that will recreate Corbusier's two Monol houses: Maison Jaoul in Paris and Sarabhai Villa in Ahmedabad. Furthermore, I will expand on these houses by creating other iterations, and transforming the grammars to understand critical major and minor moves. In the end I hope to derive architectural lessons that come from formal exercises {{that can be used in}} future design processes. I explore this practical effort by creating designs for a site in Midtown, Atlanta. I compare the process of using Shape Grammars with that of the typical studio approach. In conclusion, I find that Shape Grammars allows one to produce iterations that connect to the lessons of the original houses in an intuitive manner. M. S.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of art, desire as a {{universal}} condition has been investigated in many genres, including film, literature, fine art, comic books, and video games. Interestingly, {{there are a number}} of contemporary visual artists born in the seventies and early eighties resurrecting the topic of desire through the visual appropriation of Japanese manga and anime. This paper will underline how the subsequent influence of the exposure to Japanese popular cultural manga and other forms of anime during childhood have contributed to Eastern and Western contemporary art practices. The morphing of Japanese manga inspired images with Western symbolism, demonstrates the cultural mixing that artists have been exposed to in their upbringing. This investigation will formulate how the concept and appropriated visual forms of Japanese manga and anime used by relevant artists best question desire. The surrealists' believed that desire had the ability to transform new ways of seeing the world, and no doubt this impact is evident in the current works of Japanese artist Aya Takano, Chinese artist Cao Fei, and Australian artist Ghost Patrol. This study will be used to inform <b>my</b> <b>own</b> approach in expressing notions of desire in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> visual <b>language,</b> highlighting iconographic characters' experiences with unfulfilled desires within the narratives.

He began to venture into the newly emerging genre of techno, starting with 1991's Der Ohrenspiegel, whose 25-minute opener, Reflectorum displays some of the characteristics of the later Sinfonia Contempora series. By 1994 Roedelius' style was a heady mix of amateur electronics and sometimes clichéd ambient jazz. An album from this year; Theatreworks, was rewarded with the title [...] "album of the month" [...] by experimental music magazine The Wire. Arguably the biggest turning point in Roedelius' career came in 1994 as well. The release of Sinfonia Contempora No. 1: Von Zeit zu Zeit marked, in Roedelius' own words, [...] "Since the beginning of my career nothing was more important to me than to find <b>my</b> <b>own</b> musical <b>language.</b> I have, so I believe, eventually found it."

40|$|A Fashion Story of Light and Shadow” {{is a book}} {{recorded}} {{my thesis}} artwork and its research background. The main topic of my thesis work is light and shadow {{as well as its}} related handicraft— traditional Chinese shadow puppet opera. Based on <b>my</b> observations and <b>own</b> perspectives about light and shadow art and design works, and personal experiences of light and shadow, I {{came up with the idea}} for my thesis. The purpose is to discover the creative possibilities of approaching light and shadow, and to think about the meanings of light and shadow behind a piece of artworks or designs which are from successful artists and designers who use light and shadow to create art and design. Furthermore, absorb the knowledge from the research and try to find <b>my</b> <b>own</b> visual <b>language</b> to interpret light and shadow by combining them in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> design of fashion. The outcomes include the book and a shadow art fashion collection. The book consists two parts, the first part is the observations about light and shadow in different angles. The second part shows the behind story, principle, theories and working process of my thesis work. The full content of my thesis started with my personal perspectives of light and shadow as the starting point of the research. Then continued researching the fundamental and historical knowledge of light and shadow. After that I studied and analyzed contemporary light and shadow artworks including light and shadow related design works. These works are from different artists and designers including artists such as Tim Noble & Sue Webster, as well as James Turrell, designers such as Tord Boontje and Hussein Chalayan. Their principle of handling light and shadow helped me develop <b>my</b> <b>own</b> idea more fruitful. After that, I moved to the research of traditional Chinese shadow puppet opera. This part helped me understand light and shadow related folk art widely in diversity of aspects including cultural value, technical point of view and deep relationship between it and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> collection. In the end is the practical part which recorded the experimenting and developing process of my works. Also, the final part includes the description of the process how I developed the idea; how I executed the works; how I solved the problems and finally, how I drew the conclusion...|$|R

40|$|In {{the same}} way that a shruti box or tampura {{provides}} the supporting drone for many Indian Classical music performances, my composition seeks to create a complementary line for the sarod material within the piece. Derived from recordings of sarod, sitar, veena, violin, tanpura, swarmandal and ghungroo ankle bells, New Shruti forms a montage from all these sounds while exploring the possibilities of sound transformations common to electroacoustic music. In places the work goes beyond just a drone function — it aims to instigate, provoke, and energize the sarod material through three main sections (i) glitch and crackle (ii) pitch curves and (iii) minor slow section. Through creating this work I have discovered the beauty of both the timbres of Indian instrumental sounds, and also stylistic features commonly associated with the tradition and performance practice such as gamakas (pitch bends) and tihai rhythmic cadences. Interpreting and reworking these features into <b>my</b> <b>own</b> music <b>language</b> has brought me closer to a musical culture previously unknown and unfamiliar.

One or two ladies of the old court, women of elegant manners, and seemingly of good information,--several English women, pretty, quiet, and clever, besides a dozen men of different nations.

It seems that any younger brother, next heir, might claim the estate by turning Protestant, or drive the incumbent to the same act.

When I first laid my hand on the churchyard gate that Mary and me used to swing on, and when I looked up at the old house, with the gable ends just what they used to be (though the front was new painted, and strange names was over the shop-door)--then all my time in the wild country seem to shrivel up somehow, and better than twenty year ago begun to be a'most like yesterday.

40|$|How is it {{possible}} that civilization has a global understanding of the abstraction of the human form? At a subconscious level as humans {{we have the ability to}} find the form of the body in the most minimal of shapes, objects, landscape and even natural phenomena such as clouds, it is an ability inherent in human nature. This deep-rooted facility to recognise the human form at various levels of abstraction is also developed further by our life experiences, environment and total education; specifically in the fine and applied arts. For this research I have focused on the change between realistic representations of the human form to complete abstraction. I have broken it down to its most basic elements to explore at what point our visual language allows us to recognise and define a shape or object as being influenced by, or connected to, the human form. I have concentrated on extending <b>my</b> <b>own</b> visual <b>language</b> relating to the human form within <b>my</b> <b>own</b> practice. A series of practical research projects has been undertaken and has been supported by a new series of investigative works, drawings and written evidence of the ways in which the figure can be represented, documenting the process via the thesis and final works.

I have looked at how, over this period, artists have developed their own visual signifiers of the human form within their abstract/representational creations.
