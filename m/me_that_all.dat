In particular, he has advised <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had {{no reason to believe that}} any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E

"If the men {{employed}} by day would perform fair days work, {{it would be}} much to the public interest to have the work done in that way , [...] but experience has shewn <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the care and attention possible to give them and all the driving and encouragement is thrown away on the mechanics of this place, for if they are at work by the day on a building that there is the least chance of keeping through the whole season they will be sure to do so though it might be completed by mid-summer".|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca {{has also}} {{recovered}} from an eating disorder, which she developed at around {{the age of}} 18. [...] "Every time I looked in the mirror, I told myself 'My goodness, how fat. You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Una darling," [...] she said, [...] "we {{always were}} friends, {{and we always}} shall be. If you love <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> You're a darling. I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't heard," [...] {{said the}} man with the large chin, yawning again. [...] "Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to <b>me.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{as clean}} as you are," [...] she {{answered}} indignantly. [...] "The river muddied <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> You can go and shelter, I will stop and let the rain wash me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Babel's play Maria candidly depicts both {{political}} corruption, {{prosecution of the}} innocent, and black marketeering within Soviet society. Noting the play's implicit rejection of socialist realism, Maxim Gorky accused his friend of having a [...] "Baudelairean predilection for rotting meat." [...] Gorky further warned his friend that [...] "political inferences" [...] would be made [...] "that will be personally harmful to you." [...] According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Once Babel went to the Moscow Art Theater when his play Mariya was being given its first reading, and {{when he returned home}} he told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the actresses had been impatient {{to find out what the}} leading female role was like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the play had not come off well, but it should be noted that he was always critical of his own work." [...] Although intended to be performed in 1935, the Marias performance was cancelled by the NKVD during rehearsals. Despite its popularity in the West, Maria was not performed in Russia until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
60|$|No {{argument}} {{could have}} persuaded me, as this persuaded <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> sisterly remonstrance {{on my part}} would be completely thrown away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> {{your money}} {{is made in}} a little office like this!" [...] she exclaimed, as she sank into the easy-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ave it {{your own}} way," [...] said Mrs. Kybird, {{who was always}} {{inclined}} to make concessions in minor matters. [...] "'Ave it your own way, but don't blame <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> I ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So help <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> I want! If I got {{her once}} up here again, and {{was sure the}} thing was off, {{for a month or}} so, let me alone, then, for {{bringing}} her to reason!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{too many}} kisses afore he started," [...] {{suggested}} Uncle Gutton, {{with his mouth}} full of cold roast pork and pickles. [...] "Wonderfully nourishing thing, kisses, eh? Look at mother and <b>me.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> we live on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] he said. [...] "It isn't {{possible}} that you've cornered John D. Rockefeller's memoirs, is it? Don't tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} {{enough to tell}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> is well at home,' I answered, glancing over my father's letter. 'But how came these things?' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{afterward}} told <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> our provisions {{had been}} {{purchased by the}} owners at an auction sale of condemned navy stores in Sydney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite well; I {{was with}} him {{yesterday}} afternoon. There's nothing the matter. London was boring <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all,</b> and I thought I'd run down here {{and have a look}} at the old place, and perhaps a day's hunting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George is {{different}} from <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> Our mother's a bold woman as ever you saw, but she screams at seeing a mouse--always does--can't help it. It's her nature. So, you see, perhaps my brother can't bear ghosts. I don't mind 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|But for my part, I {{felt there}} was a show of reason in one last taunt which the rascal flung back at us as the boat receded: [...] "Sir Charles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects you. It persecutes <b>me.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> the difference." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Indeed, marshal,' {{the king}} said, 'from what I can see, {{it appears to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> Scotchmen {{are more or less}} kin to each other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know nothing}} about that, Mr. Caldigate. I haven't got {{so much as an}} opinion. People tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the things look very strong on their side.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What business?" [...] asked Sir Henry sharply. [...] "It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> you gentlemen {{know a great}} deal more than I do about my own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't say as to that. Things is {{too quiet}} to suit <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> No breeze, not a ripple a-top the water, nary a gull a-flyin' anywhere, an' the end o' the hottest day o' the year.

6000|$|... "Yes, Eliza, it's all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as wormwood; {{the very}} life is burning out of me. I'm a poor, miserable, forlorn drudge; I shall only drag you down with <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> What's {{the use of}} our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything? What's the use of living? I wish I was dead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing exciting. But I'd sure {{like to see}} any blamed old slide get {{the best}} of <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> I'm going to seal that slide down so that it'll stay there for a million years. And when the last trump sounds, and Sonoma Mountain and all the other {{mountains}} pass into nothingness, that old slide will be still a-standing there, held up by the roots." ...|$|R
60|$|That night I was happy. Spears, my veteran captain, was {{one huge}} smile; Radbourne quietly assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> was over now but the shouting; {{all the boys}} were happy.|$|E
60|$|This time I was {{pitted against}} men--the spear told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> too plainly--but {{so long as}} they didn't take me unawares or from behind I had little fear of them.|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder me. You {{have told}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> art is, in its essence, immoral. Are {{you going to}} tell me now that all thought is, in its essence, dangerous? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He cannot make <b>me</b> do <b>that.</b> <b>All</b> {{the world}} cannot change my heart, Kate. If {{you can not}} trust <b>me</b> for <b>that,</b> then you do not love me as I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense. You knocked {{some sense}} into <b>me.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> you did. Every man needs {{education}}.

6000|$|... "Generous to her! You mean {{generous to}} Lady Lovel,--generous to Lord Lovel,--generous {{to all the}} Lovels except her. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the {{generosity}} is to be on one side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{well for}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> {{are not of}} the same opinion as your Serene Highness," [...] said the young Jagd Junker, {{somewhat}} nettled; for he prided himself on his repartees.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do {{you mean}} to tell <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>all</b> the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man {{prisoner}} if we had only known it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' if any {{committee}} puts its noz into my back-yard, if it doant get {{the biggest}} cod's innards as I can collar hold on, about its ears, {{my name is}} not Treluddra!

6000|$|... "I'd {{not have}} failed before, {{but for that}} {{suspicious}} dotard Bayley," [...] grumbled Verney. [...] "Your lordship bade <b>me</b> see <b>that</b> <b>all</b> was covered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, even {{alongside}} o' Aunt Betty; for if this voyage {{has taught}} me anything at all, it has taught <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> after <b>all,</b> `there's no place like home!'" ...|$|R
