50|$|Occasionally the {{temperature}} of the urine as it leaves the urethra may be of use in <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> temperature. More often {{the temperature}} is taken in the mouth, axilla, ear or groin.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} for <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> composition {{has been developed}} for <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> volume using a different method than underwater weighing. The technique uses air as opposed to water and is known as air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Subjects enter a sealed chamber that measures their body volume through the displacement of air in the chamber. Body volume is combined with body weight (mass) {{in order to determine}} body density. The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and lean body mass (LBM) through empirically derived equations similar to those used with underwater weighing (for the density of fat and fat free mass).|$|E

40|$|Percentage of {{body fat}} is {{strongly}} associated with the risk of several chronic diseases but its accurate measurement is difficult. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a relatively simple, quick and non-invasive technique, to <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> composition. It <b>measures</b> <b>body</b> fat accurately in controlled clinical conditions but its performance {{in the field is}} inconsistent. In large epidemiologic studies simpler surrogate techniques such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio are frequently used instead of BIA to <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> fatness. We reviewed the rationale, theory, and technique of recently developed systems such as foot (or hand) -to-foot BIA measurement, and the elements that could influence its results in large epidemiologic studies. BIA results are influenced by factors such as the environment, ethnicity, phase of menstrual cycle, and underlying medical conditions. We concluded that BIA measurements validated for specific ethnic groups, populations and conditions can accurately <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> fat in those populations, but not others and suggest that for large epdiemiological studies with diverse populations BIA may not be the appropriate choice for body composition measurement unless specific calibration equations are developed for different groups participating in the study...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} bioimpedance in {{hemodialysis}} remains under debate. However, when appropriately used, bioimpedance can provide <b>measures</b> of <b>body</b> hydration {{characterized by a}} small error, a high sensitivity to changes in water volume, and, above all, a linear relationship {{over a wide range}} of volume changes. These features make it very useful to <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> hydration in hemodialysis patients...|$|R

50|$|Dr Phillips's {{estimate}} {{of the time of}} death (4:30 a.m. or before) contradicted the testimony of the witnesses Richardson, Long and Cadosch, which placed the murder later. Victorian methods of estimating time of death, such as <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> temperature, were crude, and Phillips highlighted at the inquest that the body could have cooled more quickly than normally expected.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the early}} {{research}} studies showed that BIA was quite variable {{and it was not}} regarded by many as providing an accurate measure of body composition.

He was a top Professor, and receiving a medal for his work a few years before his death in 1979.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of Mexican-American adolescents' self-reported weights, heights, and body mass indexes was evaluated {{with data from}} the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. On average, adolescents with low <b>measured</b> <b>body</b> mass indexes and high <b>measured</b> <b>body</b> mass indexes overestimated and underestimated their weights, respectively. Categories of low and high body mass indexes created by applying cutoffs to reported body mass indexes had low sensitivities. For weight, height, and <b>body</b> mass indexes, <b>measured</b> and reported values were highly correlated. This high correlation suggests that adolescents' reported values {{can be used as}} continuous variables in multivariate analyses with only small errors resulting in the coefficients for weight, height, and body mass index...|$|R
30|$|AgNPs can be {{ingested}} by H. azteca, {{independent of}} {{their degree of}} transformation. It can be only speculated whether ingested AgNPs are bioavailable, e.g., by formation and adsorption of Ag+ in the gut, and how {{and to what extent}} they contribute to the body burden. Animals collected {{at the end of the}} study were not kept under control conditions for a certain time to evacuate their gut contents. The <b>measured</b> <b>body</b> burden of the animals may therefore partly represent ingested AgNPs. Further studies are required to elucidate the dietary uptake and accumulation of AgNPs by H. azteca, as well as to clarify the order of magnitude of gut contents contributing to the <b>measured</b> <b>body</b> burden.|$|R
30|$|To have full-state {{feedback}} control for balance, the robot must know its state at every {{point in time}} in the control loop. An IMU <b>measures</b> <b>body</b> angle, and a combination of an ultrasonic sensor and an accelerometer measures height and state transition.|$|R
50|$|At the time, the {{alternative}} to fingerprints was Bertillonage, also known as Anthropometry. Developed by Alphonse Bertillon in 1879, Bertillonage consists of a meticulous method of <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> parts {{for the use of}} identifying criminals. In 1892, the British Indian police force adopted Anthropometry. Two years later, Sir Edward Henry, Inspector General of the Bengal Police in India became interested in the use of fingerprints for the use of criminal identification.|$|E

50|$|With a well {{engineered}} weighing system, body density can {{be determined}} with great accuracy by completely submerging a person in water and calculating {{the volume of the}} displaced water from the weight of the displaced water. A correction is made for the buoyancy of air in the lungs and other gases in the body spaces. If there were no errors whatsoever in <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> density, the uncertainty in fat estimation would be about Â± 3.8% of the body weight, primarily because of normal variability in body constituents.|$|E

In 1913 the department created its first Identification Officer position. The officer assigned to the position used the Bertillion System of identification, which preceded the fingerprint method used today in law enforcement. The Bertillion System used a process of <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> parts such as the nose, eyes and hands along with other characteristics to identify individuals.|$|E
