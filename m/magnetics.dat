5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton {{staring at the}} floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity <b>Magnetics</b> on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity <b>Magnetics,</b> where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{returns to}} Polarity <b>Magnetics</b> and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when {{she tries to}} arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the {{particle}} accelerator, but Davey reveals {{that he has been}} helping the government hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the particle accelerator, but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.|$|E

25|$|Lambert's book is {{fundamentally}} experimental. The forty experiments described in Photometria {{were conducted by}} Lambert between 1755 and 1760, after he decided to write a treatise on light measurement. His interest in acquiring experimental data spanned several fields: optics, thermometry, pyrometry, hydrometry, and <b>magnetics.</b> This interest in experimental data and its analysis, so evident in Photometria, is also present in other articles and books Lambert produced. For his optics work, extremely limited equipment sufficed: a few panes of glass, convex and concave lenses, mirrors, prisms, paper and cardboard, pigments, candles {{and the means to}} measure distances and angles.|$|E
25|$|The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, {{wheeled vehicle}} used {{to discern the}} {{southern}} cardinal direction (without <b>magnetics),</b> was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary Fu Xuan. The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the Weilüe, written by the East Han Dynasty politician Yuan Huan also described the south-pointing chariot {{of belonging to the}} Chinese mechanical engineer and politician Ma Jun. The Jin Dynasty (265420 CE) era text of the Shu Zheng Ji (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern gatehouse of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city. However, the later written Song Shu (Book of Song) (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as created background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1050771 BCE). The book also provided description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text reads as follows. (In this translation, by The British scientist and historian Joseph Needham, the south-pointing chariot {{is referred to as the}} south-pointing carriage.|$|E
500|$|Current causes several {{observable}} effects, which historically {{were the}} means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. One {{of the most important}} discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and <b>magnetics.</b> The level of electromagnetic emissions [...] generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.|$|E

2500|$|One {{source of}} {{confusion}} with {{the definition of}} the spherical harmonic functions concerns a phase factor of (−1)m for m > 0, 1 otherwise, commonly referred to as the Condon–Shortley phase in the quantum mechanical literature. In the quantum mechanics community, it is common practice to either include this phase factor in {{the definition of the}} associated Legendre polynomials, or to append it to the definition of the spherical harmonic functions. [...] There is no requirement to use the Condon–Shortley phase in the definition of the spherical harmonic functions, but including it can simplify some quantum mechanical operations, especially the application of raising and lowering operators. [...] The geodesy and <b>magnetics</b> communities never include the Condon–Shortley phase factor in their definitions of the spherical harmonic functions nor in the ones of the associated Legendre polynomials.|$|E
2500|$|Death Magnetic {{has been}} praised by fans {{as well as}} critics as a {{comeback}} for Metallica after the widely panned St. Anger. Thrash Hits {{was one of the}} first websites, along with The Quietus to comment on Death Magnetic, claiming [...] "it is a vast improvement on 2003 album St Anger." [...] Metal Hammer noted Death <b>Magnetics</b> [...] "sharp riffs" [...] and [...] "uncharacteristic bouncing grooves", and favorably compares the band's sound on the album to bands like Slayer, Led Zeppelin and Rage Against the Machine. Former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy has praised the album, saying [...] "Death Magnetic is hands down the best Metallica album in 20 years. This is the CD I've been waiting for them to make since …And Justice for All. And thumbs up to them for doing the first real Metallica instrumental in 20 years since 'To Live Is to Die'.
