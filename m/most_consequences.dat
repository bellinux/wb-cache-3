Here, we quantitatively demonstrate that variations in migration phenology and synchrony yield disease dynamics that significantly differ from a time-neglecting case. Extending the original definition of migratory connectivity into a spatio-temporal concept can importantly contribute to understanding the links migratory animals make across the globe and the consequences these may have both for the dynamics of their populations and the communities they visit throughout their journeys...|$|E

In the Morris water maze, contused rats treated with gacyclidine at a dosage of 0. 1 mg/kg performed better than their vehicle-treated conspecifics. Rats given gacyclidine at either 0. 3 or 0. 03 mg/kg performed better than brain-injured controls, but not as well as those treated with 0. 1 mg/kg. Counts of surviving neurons in the nucleus basalis magnoceilularis (NBM) and the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN) of the thalamus were used to determine whether gacyclidine treatment attenuated secondary cell death. In both the NBM and the MDN, the counts revealed fewer surviving neurons in untreated contused rats than in gacyclidine-treated rats.

Detection of viral genome or particles within the kidney biopsies from HCV-infected patients has proven to be difficult. Histological characterization of renal lesions still represents a major challenge. The aim of our work was to describe the histological pattern of HCV-associated nephropathy. Methods:Fifty Patients – out of 233 – presented to Mansoura Urology and Nephrology clinic with manifestations of glomerular disease were screened for HCV antibodies by a 3 rd generation ELISA test. Those tested positive for HCV antibodies were confirmed by PCR for HCV-RNA and subjected to more detailed clinical, biochemical and histological study. Kidney biopsies and in appropriate cases liver biopsies were examined by LM and electron microscopy (EM). Results:Histological study of renal biopsies revealed membranoproliferative (MPGN) type 1 to be the most common lesion encountered (54 %), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (24 %), mesangioproliferative GN (18 %), membranous nephropathy (MN) (4 %) in that order. EM examinations of renal biopsies were successful in identifying HCV like particles in frozen renal tissue. Conclusion:HCV-associated glomerulopathy is a distinct category of glomerulonephritis. Results of LM showed some peculiar features. In addition, we were successful in location and detection of HCV particles in renal tissues by EM...|$|E

Our purpose is to give a brief account on forcing axioms with a special focus on some consequences of them (SRP, OCA, PID). These principles were first isolated by Todorčević and interpolate <b>most</b> <b>consequences</b> of MM and PFA, thus providing a useful insight on the combinatorial structure {{of the theory of}} forcing axioms. In {{the first part of this}} notes we will give a brief account on forcing axioms, introducing some equivalent definition by means of generalized stationarity and presenting the consequences of them in terms of generic absoluteness. In the second part we will state the strong reflection principle (SRP), prove it under MM and examine its main consequences. This axiom is defined in terms of reflection properties of generalized stationary set. In the third part we will state the open coloring axiom (OCA), and provide consistency proofs for some versions of it. This axiom can be seen as a sort of two-dimensional perfect set property, i. e. the basic descriptive set theory result that every analytic set is either countable or it contains a perfect subset. In the last part we will explore a notable application of OCA to problems concerning properties of the continuum, in particular the existence of certain kind of gaps in ω^ω. Comment: 31 pages.

40|$|IntroductionHealth care professionals, {{especially}} nurses, are at {{the highest}} risk {{of violence in the}} workplace. Nurses present 16 times more frequent risk of victimization than other workers and psychiatric nurses report the highest rate of violent assault in comparison to other nurses. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (2002) defines violence in the workplace as “all situations of physical assault, threatening behavior or verbal abuse that occur in the workplace”. This phenomenon, which is steadily increasing, may affect the professional resilience of operators and may account for the high rate of burn out syndrome in health care professionals. AimIt is a preliminary cross-sectional investigation among nurses in order to evaluate the rate and the features of violence incidents that occurred during the previous 3 years in the following health care settings: Emergency, Psychiatric and General Hospital. Materials and MethodsA self-assessment questionnaire, “Violent Incident Form” (VIF) (Arnetz, 1998), was subministered in order to identify the following features of aggressiveness occurred during the previous 3 years in the health care workplaces above mentioned. ResultsIn Psychiatric Wards, violence appeared more frequent inside the ward, without a specific pattern in comparison to nurse shifts; physical attack was prevalent; aggressors were more frequently young and male patients; <b>most</b> <b>consequences</b> were physical damages reported by professionals, but their reaction was never represented by a police report. In Emergency Departments, verbal aggression was prevalent and took place most frequently in waiting rooms during night shifts; aggressors were more frequently male relatives of patients, with an age ranged between 40 - 49 years; the most frequent reaction of professionals was a police report even without physical damages reported. In General Hospital Wards, violence was less frequent than in the other settings; verbal attacks were prevalent and most frequently occurred inside the ward during day shifts; aggressors were represented similarly by both patients and relatives, with an age ranged between 50 - 59 years; the most frequent reactions of professionals were both police and incident reports. Discussion and ConclusionOur results, in accordance with the literature, highlight that aggressiveness in health care settings is a frequent and notable phenomenon which can be strongly conditioned by illnesses of patients and by the way they are assisted them in each setting...|$|E
40|$|Guilan {{province}} is {{a suitable}} area for growing second crop after rice in autumn. Growing a crop {{in a field}} of rice after it is harvested in addition to creation of job and increasing farmer’s income, can be used to produce a winter crop for the second six months of year. One of the <b>most</b> <b>consequences</b> of producing one or two crops is to conserve water and soil resources and reduces pollution caused by excessive chemical inputs and also maintaining and improving soil fertility in the long term. To investigate the effect of remains of fertilizers used in faba- bean on rice yield in faba bean- rice cropping system a research concering growing two crops in one year, namly rice var. Hashemi (June- September) and a second crop, faba bean var. Barkat (November- May) was performed with 15 fertilizer treatments for faba bean {{in the form of a}} factorial randomized complete block design with three replications in the Research Field of Rice Institute of Iran during years of 2012 - 2015 (growing two crops of rice and three crops of faba bean). Experimental factors for faba bean consisted of five nitrogen rates (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg. ha- 1 N) from urea and three phosphorus levels (0, 50 and 100 kg. ha- 1 P) from triple superphosphate fertilizer. The results showed that faba bean yield increased up to 2003 kg. ha- 1 and 285 kg. ha- 1 by increasing nitrogen and phosphorus levels respectively. The highest seed yield (4833. 8 kg. ha- 1) was observed in the treatment N 100 P 100 where the difference with that of N 100 P 50 treatment (4744. 5 kg. ha- 1) was non significant. The results also showed that nitrogen and phosphorus used in faba bean increased soil nitrogen by 0. 147 % to 0. 178 % and 0. 209 % and soil phosphorus by 24. 2 ppm to 40. 59 and 37. 51 ppm in the first and second years of rice production, respectively.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Despite {{a general}} recognition that benthic macroinvertebrates respond {{to changes in}} hydrological connectivity within floodplain ecosystems, no consensus about patterns in community structure and ecosystem processes across large scales and different climates has yet been established. Such knowledge is necessary since anthropogenic activities continue to alter the natural hydrogeomor- phology of large floodplains, with <b>most</b> <b>consequences</b> for aquatic communities remaining unknown. 2. Using information from six large rivers located in four different climate regions (humid subtropi- cal, maritime temperate, Mediterranean and dry semi-arid), we compared benthic macroinvertebrate responses along lateral gradients of hydrological connectivity. We tested hypotheses related to differences among climate regions and to similar hydrological constraints within any one climate. The large geographical scale covered by this study provides the first comprehensive comparison of aquatic community patterns across hydrological gradients under different climatic settings. 3. Multivariate ordinations demonstrated a higher overlap of trait community composition (50 % variance explained by the first two axes) than taxonomic composition (15 %) among floodplains, displaying high interclimate trait stability. The taxonomy-based ordination separated the subtropical floodplain, with an average 86 % of non-insect taxa, from the insect-dominated temperate, Mediterra- nean and semi-arid floodplains (with > 50 % insect abundance). In the trait-based ordination, large body size (60 % of organisms > 4 cm) and long lifespan duration (80 % of organisms) discriminated the subtropical from the other five studied floodplains. 4. Across a gradient of lateral connectivity, linear mixed effect (LME) models supported seven of 15 hypotheses, which suggests remarkably consistent macroinvertebrate patterns in floodplains regard- less of the climate regime. Taxon and trait richness were positively related and peaked at sites of intermediate hydrological connectivity. Our predictions about the feeding guilds of macroinverte- brates (e. g. that shredders and scrapers would be more abundant in connected channels, and predators and deposit feeders at isolated sites) were more strongly supported by the data than those about life history (e. g. plurivoltinism and short lifespan would be better represented in con- nected channels). This difference {{was related to the}} influence of extended periods of hydrological disconnection as disturbance in addition to flooding. 5. Trait stability across hydrological connectivity provides a meaningful ecological context for the comparison of the macroinvertebrate benthos among climatic zones, where taxonomic composition differs strongly. In addition, trait similarities and dissimilarities found in this study suggest that large-scale biogeographical filters do operate on communities, resulting in different trait combinations in temperate and Mediterranean floodplains when compared to semi-arid and subtropical environ- ments. The extent to which global macroecological factors (i. e. climate, dispersal history) and local biotic and abiotic factors (i. e. drought frequency, habitat structure, water chemistry) contribute to this difference requires further investigation...|$|E
