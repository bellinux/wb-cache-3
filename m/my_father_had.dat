My father, liberal, but not active in public affairs; my mother, idealistic, with a lively interest in public matters; the founder about 1854 of the kindergarten in my home town, devoted to science. My parents had broken through the shackles of dogma. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom.|$|E

2500|$|Henry however, {{disagrees with}} Clifford, arguing that {{passing on the}} burden of kingship is not {{necessarily}} the natural thing for a father to do, as it brings no reward when that title was unlawfully obtained in the first place ("things ill got, had ever bad success": Henry is referring to the deposition and assassination of Richard II by his own grandfather, Henry IV). By disinheriting his son, Henry seems to think he is protecting the Prince, ensuring that he will never suffer the hardships he himself experienced when he was left a usurped inheritance by his own father ("I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> left me no more"); ...|$|E

The organisers were scared of starting them all together, so split the field into two groups – a little girl of five made the draw. My father was the race favourite; second favourite was Castéra, who was second at St Cloud; third favourite was an English visitor, a student from Cambridge named Johnson, who had won races at home. My father was now considered so much a friend of France {{that he was being}} called 'The Flying Parisian'.|$|E

Kusama says that her mother would often send her to spy on her father's extra-marital affairs, which instilled within her a lifelong contempt for sexuality, particularly the male body and the phallus: [...] "I don’t like sex. I had an obsession with sex. When I was a child, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> lovers and I experienced seeing him. My mother sent me to spy on him.

Peter visits Mickey, who initially rejects him. Mickey later accepts him as his son after beating him in the [...] "game of drink" [...] (the game of drink referring to matching shots until one passes out).

A tribute was also reported from a leading Irish Trade Unionist Peter Bunting. Bunting's father was once held at gun point by McCaughey in 1971 due to the fact he was a Catholic and was forced to leave his job. Bunting stated [...] "Billy McCaughey was prepared to kill for what he saw as his people. At the end of his days, he had lived for more people than he could have ever dreamed about in 1971. I would also like to think that, if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> lived long enough to witness the full life of Billy McCaughey, then he too would have recognised him as a brother and a comrade."
