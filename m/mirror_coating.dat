25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of the <b>mirror</b> <b>coating</b> can {{be measured}} using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light.|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. When they hit {{the surface of the}} mirror, they cool and stick. Some <b>mirror</b> <b>coating</b> shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E
2500|$|Glass gobos [...] {{are made}} from clear glass with a partial <b>mirror</b> <b>coating</b> to block the light and produce [...] "black" [...] areas in the {{projected}} image. This eliminates any need for bridging and accommodates more intricate images. Glass gobos can also include colored areas (much like stained glass windows), whether by multiple layers of dichroic glass (one for each color) glued on an aluminium or chrome coated black and white gobo, or by newer technologies that vary {{the thickness of the}} dichroic coating (and therefore the color) in a controlled way on a single piece of glass—which makes it possible to turn a color photo into a glass gobo. Glass gobos generally offer the highest image fidelity, but are the most fragile. Glass gobos are typically created with laser ablation or photo etching.|$|E

5000|$|As the {{incidence}} angle {{on the lower}} surface of the lower prism {{is less than the}} critical angle, total internal reflection does not occur.

50|$|In {{binoculars}} with Schmidt-Pechan roof prisms, mirror coatings {{are added}} to some surfaces of the roof prism because the light is incident {{at one of the}} prism's glass-air boundaries at an angle less than the critical angle so total internal reflection does not occur.

Mirrored sunglasses are one-way mirrors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} of the prism can be further improved by using a dielectric coating rather than a metallic <b>mirror</b> <b>coating.</b> This causes the prism surfaces {{to act as a}} dielectric mirror. A well-designed dielectric coating can provide a reflectivity of more than 99% across the visible light spectrum.

50|$|Dielectric {{coatings}} {{are used}} in Schmidt-Pechan roof prisms to cause the prism surfaces {{to act as a}} dielectric mirror. The non-metallic dielectric reflective coating is formed from several multilayers of alternating high and low refractive index materials deposited on the roof prism's reflective surfaces. Each single multilayer reflects a narrow band of light frequencies so several multilayers, each tuned to a different color, are required to reflect white light. This multi-multilayer coating increases reflectivity from the prism surfaces by acting as a distributed Bragg reflector. A well-designed dielectric coating can provide a reflectivity of more than 99% across the visible light spectrum. This reflectivity is much improved compared to either an aluminium <b>mirror</b> <b>coating</b> (87% to 93%) or silver <b>mirror</b> <b>coating</b> (95% to 98%).|$|E

40|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) is a self-limiting {{subset of}} {{chemical vapor deposition}} that has become widely popular in materials science applications such as device packaging, semiconductor passivation, transistor gate dielectrics, optical coatings, and protective barriers. ALD is capable of uniformly coating high-aspect ratio features, such as 1 -dimensional nanostructures or pinhole-sized vias, across a macroscopic distance {{which is expected to}} only be limited {{by the size of the}} deposition chamber. This work reviews several applications of ALD used to deposit thin conformal layers of dielectric material which specifically capitalize on the precise, conformal nature of the deposition process. Semiconductor nanowire networks coated with aluminum oxide (AlOx) by plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) show blue-shifted photoluminescence with increasing AlOx thickness. Novel memristor “edge” devices fabricated with an active switching layer of titanium dioxide deposited by PEALD yield an active device cross-section two orders of magnitude smaller than what is possible with conventional 2 -dimensional thin film devices fabricated by similar photolithography methods. Protected silver <b>mirrors</b> <b>coated</b> with AlOx deposited by PEALD have superior durability when compared to <b>mirrors</b> <b>coated</b> with an identical layer of AlOx deposited by conventional physical vapor deposition. All of these applications benefit from the robust uniform coating properties of the ALD growth mechanism. Additional studies of dielectric barrier overlayers deposited by ALD on silver mirrors are discussed, and a figure of merit is proposed for judging overall mirror performance...|$|R
