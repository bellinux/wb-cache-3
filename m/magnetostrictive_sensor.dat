40|$|A magnetomechanical {{model for}} the design and control of Villari-effect <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensors</b> is presented. The model quantifies the {{magnetization}} changes that a magnetostrictive material undergoes when subjected to a dc excitation field and variable stresses. The magnetic behavior is characterized by considering the Jiles-Atherton mean field theory for ferromagnetic hysteresis, which is constructed from a thermodynamic balance between the energy available for magnetic moment rotation and the energy lost as domain walls attach to and detach from pinning sites. The effect of stress on magnetization is quantified through a law of approach to the anhysteretic magnetization. Elastic properties of the sensor are incorporated {{by means of a}} wave equation that quantifies the strains and stresses arising in response to moment rotations. This yields a nonlinear PDE system for the strains, stresses and magnetization state of a magnetostrictive transducer as it drives or is driven by external loads. Because the model addresses the magnetoelastic coupling, it is applicable to both <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensors</b> and actuators.

40|$|Computational {{micromagnetics}} {{in three}} dimensions is of increasing interest {{with the development of}} <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensors</b> andactuators. In solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, the governing equation of magnetic dynamics for ferromagnetic materials, we need to evaluate the effective field. The effective field consists of several terms, among which the demagnetizing field is of long-range nature. Evaluating the demagnetizing field directly requires work of O(N^ 2) for a grid of N cells and thus it is the bottleneck in computational micromagnetics. A fast hierarchical algorithm using multipole approximation is developed to evaluate the demagnetizing field. We first construct a mesh hierarchy and divide the grid into boxes of different levels. The lowest level box is the whole grid while the highest level boxes are just cells. The approximate field contribution from the cells contained in a box is characterized by the box attributes, which are obtained via multipole approximation. The algorithm computes field contributions from remote cells using attributes of appropriate boxes containing those cells, and it computes contributions from adjacent cells directly.

Guided Waves are structure-borne ultrasonic waves that propagate along the structure confined and guided by its geometric boundaries. Guided Wave Testing can find defect locations through longrange screening using low-frequency waves (from 5 to 250 kHz).

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} {{are widely used}} in aerospace, mechanical, civil and other industries because of their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. However, composite structures are highly prone to impact damage. Possible types of defect or damage in composite include matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination between plies. In addition, delamination in a laminated composite is usually invisible. It is very diffcult to detect it while the component is in service and this will eventually lead to catastrophic failure of the structure. Such damages {{may be caused by}} dropped tools and ground handling equipments. Damage in a composite structure normally starts as a tiny speckle and gradually grows with the increase in load to some degree. However, when such damage reaches a threshold level, serious accident can occur. Hence, {{it is important to have}} up-to-date information on the integrity of the structure to ensure the safety and reliability of composite components, which require frequent inspections to identify and quantify damage that might have occurred even during manufacturing, transportation or storage. How to identify a damage using the obtained information from a damaged composite structure is one of the most pivotal research objectives. Various forms of structural damage cause variations in structural mechanical characteristics, and this property is extensively employed for damage detection. Existing traditional non-destructive inspection techniques utilize a variety of methods such as acoustic emission, C-scan, thermography, shearography and Moir interferometry etc. Each of these techniques is limited in accuracy and applicability. Most of these methods require access to the structure. They also require a significant amount of equipment and expertise to perform inspection. The inspections are typically based on a schedule rather than based on the condition of the structure. Furthermore, the cost associated with these traditional non-destructive techniques can be rather prohibitive. Therefore, there is a need to develop a cost-effective, in-service, diagnostic system for monitoring structural integrity in composite structures. Structural health monitoring techniques based on dynamic response is being used for several years. Changes in lower natural frequencies and mode shapes with their special derivatives or stiffness/ exibility calculation from the measured displacement mode shapes are the most common parameters used in identification of damage. But the sensitivity of these parameters for incipient damage is not satisfactory. On the other hand, for in service structural health monitoring, direct use of structural response histories are more suitable. However, they are very few works reported in the literature on these aspects, especially for composite structures, where higher order modes are the ones that get normally excited due to the presence of flaws. Due to the absence of suitable direct procedure, damage identification from response histories needs inverse mapping; like artificial neural network. But, the main diffculty in such mapping using whole response histories is its high dimensionality. Different general purpose dimension reduction procedures; like principle component analysis or indepen- dent component analysis are available in the literature. As these dimensionally reduced spaces may loose the output uniqueness, which is an essential requirement for neural network mapping, suitable algorithms for extraction of damage signature from these re- sponse histories are not available. Alternatively, fusion of trained networks for different partitioning of the damage space or different number of dimension reduction technique, can overcome this issue efficiently. In addition, coordination of different networks trained with different partitioning for training and testing samples, training algorithms, initial conditions, learning and momentum rates, architectures and sequence of training etc., are some of the factors that improves the mapping efficiency of the networks. The applications of smart materials have drawn much attention in aerospace, civil, mechanical and even bioengineering. The emerging field of smart composite structures offers the promise of truly integrated health and usage monitoring, where a structure can sense and adapt to their environment, loading conditions and operational requirements, and materials can self-repair when damaged. The concept of structural health monitoring using smart materials relies on a network of sensors and actuators integrated with the structure. This area shows great promise as it will be possible to monitor the structural condition of a structure, throughout its service lifetime. Integrating intelligence into the structures using such networks is an interesting field of research in recent years. Some materials that are being used for this purpose include piezoelectric, magnetostrictive and fiber-optic sensors. Structural health monitoring using, piezoelectric or fiber-optic sensors are available in the literature. However, very few works have been reported in the literature on the use of magnetostrictive materials, especially for composite structures. Non contact sensing and actuation with high coupling factor, along with other prop- erties such as large bandwidth and less voltage requirement, make magnetostrictive materials increasingly popular as potential candidates for sensors and actuators in structural health monitoring. Constitutive relationships of magnetostrictive material are represented through two equations, one for actuation and other for sensing, both of which are coupled through magneto-mechanical coefficient. In existing finite element formulation, both the equations are decoupled assuming magnetic field as proportional to the applied current. This assumption neglects the stiffness contribution coming from the coupling between mechanical and magnetic domains, which can cause the response to deviate from the time response. In addition, due to different fabrication and curing difficulties, the actual properties of this material such as magneto-mechanical coupling coefficient or elastic modulus, may differ from results measured at laboratory conditions. Hence, identification of the material properties of these embedded sensor and actuator are essential at their in-situ condition. Although, finite element method still remains most versatile, accurate and generally applicable technique for numerical analysis, the method is computationally expensive for wave propagation analysis of large structures. This is because for accurate prediction, the finite element size should be of the order of the wavelength, which is very small due to high frequency loading. Even in health monitoring studies, when the flaw sizes are very small (of the order of few hundred microns), only higher order modes will get affected. This essentially leads to wave propagation problem. The requirement of cost-effective computation of wave propagation brings us to the necessity of spectral finite element method, which is suitable for the study of wave propagation problems. By virtue of its domain transfer formulation, it bypasses the large system size of finite element method. Further, inverse problem such as force identification problem can be performed most conveniently and efficiently, compared to any other existing methods. In addition, spectral element approach helps us to perform force identification directly from the response histories measured in the sensor. The spectral finite element is used widely for both elementary and higher order one or two dimensional waveguides. Higher order waveguides, normally gives a behavior, where a damping mode (evanescent) will start propagating beyond a certain frequency called the cut-off frequency. Hence, when the loading frequencies are much beyond their corresponding cut-off frequencies, higher order mo des start propagating along the structure and should be considered in the analysis of wave propagations. Based on these considerations, three main goals are identified to be pursued in this thesis. The first is to develop the constitutive relationship for <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensor</b> and actuator suitable for structural analysis. The second is the development of different numerical tools for the modelling the damages. The third is the application of these developed elements towards solving inverse problems such as, material property identification, impact force identification, detection and identification of delamination in composite structure. The thesis consists of four parts spread over six chapters. In the first part, linear, nonlinear, coupled and uncoupled constitutive relationships of magnetostrictive materials are studied and the elastic modulus and magnetostrictive constant are evaluated from the experimental results reported in the literature. In uncoupled model, magnetic field for actuator is considered as coil constant times coil current. The coupled model is studied without assuming any explicit direct relationship with magnetic field. In linear coupled model, the elastic modulus, the permeability and magnetostrictive coupling are assumed as constant. In nonlinear-coupled model, the nonlinearity is decoupled and solved separately for the magnetic domain and mechanical domain using two nonlinear curves,’ namely the stress vs. strain curve and magnetic flux density vs. magnetic field curve. This is done by two different methods. In the first, the magnetic flux density is computed iteratively, while in the second, artificial neural network is used, where a trained network gives the necessary strain and magnetic flux density for a given magnetic field and stress level. In the second part, different finite element formulations for composite structures with embedded magnetostrictive patches, which can act both as sensors and actuators, is studied. Both mechanical and magnetic degrees of freedoms are considered in the formulation. One, two and three-dimensional finite element formulations for both coupled and uncoupled analysis is developed. These developed elements are then used to identify the errors in the overall response of the structure due to uncoupled assumption of the magnetostrictive patches and shown that this error is comparable with the sensitivity of the response due to different damage scenarios. These studies clearly bring out the requirement of coupled analysis for structural health monitoring when <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensor</b> and actuator are used. For the specific cases of beam elements, super convergent finite element formulation for composite beam with embedded magnetostrictive patches is introduced for their specific advantages in having superior convergence and in addition, these elements are free from shear locking. A refined 2 -node beam element is derived based on classical and first order shear deformation theory for axial-flexural-shear coupled deformation in asymmetrically stacked laminated composite beams with magnetostrictive patches. The element has an exact shape function matrix, which is derived by exactly solving the static part of the governing equations of motion, where a general ply stacking is considered. This makes the element super convergent for static analysis. The formulated consistent mass matrix, however, is approximate. Since the stiffness is exactly represented, the formulated element predicts natural frequency to greater level of accuracy with smaller discretization compared to other conventional finite elements. Finally, these elements are used for material property identification in conjunction with artificial neural network. In the third part, frequency domain analysis is performed using spectrally formulated beam elements. The formulated elements consider deformation due to both shear and lateral contraction, and numerical experiments are performed to highlight the higher order effects, especially at high frequencies. Spectral element is developed for modelling wave propagation in composite laminate in the presence of magnetostrictive patches. The element, by virtue of its frequency domain formulation, can analyze very large domain with nominal cost of computation and is suitable for studying wave propagation through composite materials. Further more, identification of impact force is performed form the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensor</b> response histories using these spectral elements. In the last part, different numerical examples for structural health monitoring are directed towards studying the responses due to the presence of the delamination in the structure; and the identification of the delamination from these responses using artificial neural network. Neural network is applied to get structural damage status from the finite element response using its mapping feature, which requires output uniqueness. To overcome the loss of output uniqueness due to the dimension reduction, damage space is divided into different overlapped zones and then different networks are trained for these zones. Committee machine is used to co ordinate among these networks. Next, a five-stage hierarchy of networks is used to consider partitioning of damage space, where different dimension reduction algorithms and different partitioning between training and testing samples are used for better mapping fro the identification procedure. The results of delamination detection for composite laminate show that the method developed in this thesis can be applied to structural damage detection and health monitoring for various industrial structures. This thesis collectively addresses all aspects pertaining to the solution of inverse problem and specially the health monitoring of composite structures using magnetostric tive sensor and actuator. In addition, the thesis discusses the necessity of higher order theory in the high frequency analysis of wavw propagation. The thesis ends with brief summary of the tasks accomplished, significant contribution made to the literature and the future applications where the proposed methods addressed in this thesis can be applied...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{technology}} and new applications of <b>magnetostrictive</b> bilayer <b>sensors</b> were introduced and developed within an international consortium {{based on the}} EU project B-SENS. Specific bilayer sensors exhibit bending and temperature sensitivity through specific arrangements. Basically, a magnetoelastic layer (ML) is affixed to a nonmagnetic counter layer (CL) forming a bilayer; bending or heating of the latter induces nearly uniform mechanic stress in ML. The resulting permeability changes within ML are transformed to an output signal reflecting bilayer curvature or temperature. The technological approaches considered not only different materials for ML and CL but also different geometries of the bilayers and various combination methods to form the bilayer. The manufactured sensors ranged from miniature 30 μm thick bilayer wires over micro-bilayers with rectangular structures up to centimetre sized macro-bilayers of 100 μm thickness. A huge number of applications were introduced in both technical and medical fields. Displacement, acceleration, and flow sensors were realised, whereas especially the flat sensor design favoured diverse applications in the medical field. In particular, the sensor principle was very successfully applied for unique skin curvature sensors over numerous human skin regions; it offered {{for the first time}} physiological data hidden in the regional and dynamic skin deformations. Among others, blood pressure, eye movements, cardiorespiratory activity could be assessed in an unobtrusive way. After the B-SENS project, several post-projects and studies dealt with further optimisation of the <b>magnetostrictive</b> bilayer <b>sensors</b> and their embedding into plaster-like medical detectors for multiparametric physiological monitoring.

40|$|Smart Composite {{laminates}} {{with multiple}} magnetorestrictive patches have been fabricated, one patch is for actuation {{and the other}} patch is for sensing. Horse-show type coil arrangement is used for actuation and sensing, which contains two arms, one arm is used for actuation and the other arm for sensing. Delamination sensing is carried out for composite laminated beam specimens, one with delamination and the other without any defect or damage. Actuation coil is used to induce stress in the magnetostrictive material, sensing coil is used for sensing to measure the induced open circuit voltage. Due to delamination, the stress produced in the magnetostrictive patch changes and that alters the magnetic flux through the sensing coil. This causes {{a change in the}} induced open circuit voltage across the sensing coil. The paper presents, the sensing of delamination in composite laminates using multiple magnetostrictive patches with horse-shoe type coil arrangement. The difference in the open circuit voltage with and without delamination is treated as delamination sensing voltage. For theoretical modeling, different models of the laminated composite beams with <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>sensors</b> and actuators have been developed for the beams with and without delamination. Finite element analysis is carried out using NISA finite element software. Numerical values of open circuit voltage verses actuation current for both the experimental and computational studies are presented. Comparison of experimental and the computational studies shows that there is a good agreement between both the results obtained. Hence, the modeling method is very efficient and may be very much useful for the further studies related to the smart structures with intelligent materials...|$|R
