50|$|They {{were open}} trams with {{passengers}} seated on cross-benches, and no weather protection on the cars' sides. Duncan & Fraser built them with summer excursions in mind {{but they had}} limited utility {{due to the lack}} of weather proofing. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use.|$|E
5000|$|In the cabs of light-rail cars the {{emergency}} brake {{is often a}} large red button, which the train crew {{refers to as the}} [...] "mushroom"; this also activates the magnetic track brakes. The mechanism of an emergency brake may differ, depending on railcar design. Emergency-braking a train (without track brakes) will give about 1.5 m/s2 (0.15 g) deceleration. The braking distance will be approximately 250 m at 100 km/h and 600 m at 160 km/h. High-speed trains are usually equipped with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake,</b> which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances like 850 m at 200 km/h and 1900 m at 300 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|A new truck {{design was}} {{a major part of}} the {{improved}} ride. The truck carried four new design compact [...] motors provided by General Electric. It had smaller diameter wheels (28 in) and a smaller truck frame. Both allowed the car to have a lower center of gravity. Two types of brakes were provided. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> riding between the car's wheels on each truck pressed onto the rail head when the air brakes needed supplemental stopping power. The Red Devils were known for their excellent ride at high speed on rough interurban track. Unfortunately, when the Great Depression deepened, C&LE business declined and it abandoned in 1938 and sold the Red Devils to LVT and to CRANDIC.|$|E

50|$|The A2 type trams {{were again}} {{converted}} from B type 'toast rack' trams and also entered {{service on the}} Port Adelaide tram system in 1917, although the conversion work was this time undertaken in house by the MTT at Hackney Workshops. Unlike the A1 type which had traditional wooden sides, the A2 type trams had flat steel plates fitted and rivetted to the sides forming the saloon. Unlike the A, A1 and C types, the A2s had three large windows instead of 5 as per the other types. Despite the different body work for the saloon section, the seating and standing capacity for these trams {{were the same as}} the A, A1 and C types. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use.|$|E
50|$|Seventeen B type 'toastrack' trams were rebuilt by Duncan & Fraser (though it is {{believed}} that car 45 was rebuilt in house by the MTT at Hackney Workshops) were converted into A1 type 'California Combination' trams, similar to the A and later C types although the ends didn't drop down on the A1s. They were converted primarily for the isolated Port Adelaide tram system which was run by the MTT and ran between 1917 and 1935. These trams retained their previous B type numbers (refer to fleet table above). All cars had Hale Kilburn fixed rattan seating in the saloon except for car 44 which had wooden seats running along the sides of the saloon. Wooden seating was fitted to the open ends and these cars had the same passenger capacity (seated as well as 'crush load') as the A type. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use.|$|E
50|$|Type A trams {{were the}} most common on the newly opened lines with seventy of the initial hundred trams made in this single truck {{combination}} style. They incorporated a closed central saloon and open crossbenches on the same tram. Capable of up to 22 mi/h km/h, they had a seating capacity of twenty in the saloons with an additional twenty in the open benches. The bodies were made by Duncan & Fraser, who had built horse tram cars for the AS&T as well as bodies of electric trams for Melbourne service. All 70 A type trams were originally fitted with Brill Winner style seats in the saloon section but in 1937, 20 cars (numbers unknown) had their seats replaced with Hale Kilburn fixed rattan seats, removed out of the 20 C type cars. The removed A type seats were then fitted into the C type trams. These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use.|$|E
5000|$|Three new low-floor tramcars were {{purchased}} from Bombardier, numbered 501-503. The purchase price was €4.6 million each. In addition, three old trams (VIII, X and XI) from the then-current fleet {{were chosen to}} be retained and modernized through rebuilding of their chassis, and the fitting of dual traction control systems. The emergency braking system was converted to <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> instead of the caliper brakes previously used. Trolley pole current collection was replaced by pantograph collection with the change; the overhead wires were modified accordingly. The first of three new Bombardier vehicles arrived on 2 April 2009; the other two cars followed in early May. The delivery of the three rebuilt old cars took place at a later date. In 2011 a fourth Bombardier tramcar was delivered, numbered 504 and identical to the other three.|$|R
50|$|Each train {{will have}} a length of 68.3 m - 0.9 m longer than the Class 423, but 1.1 m shorter than the Class 422. The cab meets the EN 15227 {{standard}} (requirements for crashworthiness for railway vehicle bodies) and is therefore longer {{than that of the}} corresponding Class 423. The Class 430 is shorter than the class 422 because in the middle car, a single row of seats replaced a double row, allowing the car to be shorter. This was required because trains must fit alongside a 210 m platform; with three units coupled together, the Class 430 {{will have a}} length of 204.9 m. The trains have <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> The driver has two options for controlling the doors: first, the driver can unlock the doors on the platform side, and the passengers open the doors themselves with a pushbutton (as in the Class 423); second, the driver can unlock and open all of the doors on the platform side at once. The trains have more opening windows than the class 423, and larger information displays in the vestibules, similar to those on the Class 425. The information displays {{on the outside of the}} train are twice as big. The seats are in the standard DB colors, but with leather headrests. The seatbacks are ergonomically shaped and padded.|$|R
40|$|Adhesion, or {{adhesion}} coefficient, {{is given}} by {{the ratio of the}} longitudinal tangential (i. e., braking or traction) force over the normal force at the wheel-rail contact. The tangential force that a braking or tractive railway wheel can exert on a rail is limited by the friction coefficient available between the surfaces in contact for a given normal load. In clean steel-on-steel contacts, the friction coefficient is known to be mostly higher than the adhesion requirements for normal traction and braking operations of existing rolling stock. However, contaminations, such as leaves, grease and water, can easily be present at the wheel-rail contact and reduce the friction level, leading to low adhesion problems. In recent decades, some railways, such as in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany, have particularly been affected in autumn due to the presence of moisture and fallen leaves, among other contaminants. When low adhesion occurs, delays in the train service may be the clearest consequence to the railway commuters. However, many other negative effects may arise, such as damages to wheels and rails, signals passed at danger, station platform overruns and even collisions. Therefore, not only the reliability but also the safety and costs of railway transportation may be compromised. Extreme low adhesion conditions in the Netherlands on October 27, 2002 forced the major train operating company (NS) and the infrastructure manager (ProRail) to stop the services on most of the sections of the network during that day and considerable disruptions continued the days after. In order to mitigate the low adhesion problem, the affected infrastructure managers and train operating companies have taken a variety of countermeasures. However, the problems still persist. This may partly be attributed to insufficient understanding of the problem and its possible countermeasures. The investigations presented in this dissertation, which have been commissioned by ProRail and NS within a research project called AdRem, have aimed at improving this understanding towards an effective solution to the problem. Four existing countermeasures have been investigated in this dissertation, namely friction modifiers, sanding, <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> and traction control.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{new kind}} of rail transit vehicle braking mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake. The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic brake implementation on rail transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic rail brake and electromagnetic eddy current brake. Electromagnetic rail brake (also called <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake)</b> is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> which mounted on bogie and rail.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{more and}} more {{passengers}} use the train and there are increasing demands {{on the quality of}} service. There is a need for faster, more reliable and safer transport at lower costs. There is also need for more trains on the same track. Low adhesion (slippery track) affects those needs negatively. A lot of research on low adhesion issues has been carried out and there are many measures already developed, despite of this research and those measures there is still experienced inconvenience by low adhesion. The lack of knowledge about the low adhesion problem is the major reason that the problem still exists. Cause of the limited knowledge about low adhesion is the lack of a measurement instrument to map the low adhesion problem as it occurs in practice. This measurement instrument should not only be able to measure the extent of low adhesion, but also be able to measure data in order to make relations between low adhesion and place, time, measures taken, control by the driver and train performance. To identify those relations well it is necessary to perform a lot of measurements. To get the desired insights five measuring trains have been developed able to measure the above mentioned data. The majority of the measurement data is coming from data already present in the train. Because of this the trains don’t have to be equipped with complex measurement instruments outside the train and therefore it is possible to carry out the measurements with passenger trains running in service. Based on the research the following insights have been obtained: • Brake and acceleration performance on low adhesion. • Where and when low adhesion occurs. • The amount of time in which low adhesion can grow. • Influence of low adhesion on driving time and driving-on-time-punctuality. • Behaviour (acceleration/braking) of the driver in case of low adhesion. • Effectiveness of measures (WSP, traction control, Sandite, <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brake)</b> and the low-adhesion-prediction-model. The research conducted made the low adhesion problem measurable and therefore clear. Based on the obtained insights a lot of solutions are given to reduce inconvenience...|$|E
25|$|A further ten cars, {{numbered}} 116 to 125, {{were obtained}} {{during the year}} and during their life proved popular with the crews. They were top-covered, with normal stairs, and bodies built by the United Electric Car Company of Preston. They were fitted to Brill 21 E trucks and had two 40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors with Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment, and B.T.H. magnetic slipper brakes. In May, one of these, no. 121, was demonstrated to the Committee, showing {{the action of the}} “run back” preventer and of the combined <b>magnetic</b> and mechanical <b>track</b> <b>brake.</b> At a later date this car was involved in an incident. It was foggy at the time, and both driver and conductor alighted near the top of Derby Road to find their whereabouts. On returning to their car they found that it had run away backwards down the hill to Gregory Street, where it collided with another car, knocking the latter into some gardens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opening of}} the line to Slaithwaite {{required}} additional rolling stock, {{and it was this}} that ultimately led to the decision to electrify the whole system. Reports were produced by the Tramways Department, the Electricity Department and by the Borough Engineer, Mr K F Campbell. Campbell suggested building a new power station, car sheds and offices at Longroyd Bridge, and this was accepted by the Corporation. They obtained powers and borrowed £47,780, (...) to modernise and electrify the system in 1900. The main contractors were Greenwood & Batley of Leeds. 25 new tramcars were ordered from G.F. Milnes, who had by this time moved to a new works at Hadley in Shropshire. Each car ran on two four-wheeled bogies, had an open upper deck, and seating for 56 passengers. The downstairs saloon was heated, with crimson velvet cushions and curtains at the windows. The power station was formally opened on 7 February 1901. 150 guests were invited to the event, including the managers of other local tramway systems. The Board of Trade then made an inspection of the tracks, and electric services started running from Huddersfield railway station in St. George's Square to Outlane and Lindley both via Marsh and Edgerton on 14 February 1901. The first phase included the conversion of five routes, and these were completed by the end of February. A second phase was completed between February and July 1902, {{when the rest of the}} lines were converted. This phase included an extension to Honley of the existing tracks to Berry Brow. Honley was the first place served which was outside the Borough of Huddersfield. A further 36 tramcars were ordered from the British Electric Car Co of Trafford Park, Manchester. These were of two designs, seating 51 and 55 passengers. They had an open-topped upper deck and ran on a 4-wheeled truck. They were better suited to the steeply graded routes than the larger bogie cars. In 1903, nine more tramcars were purchased, bringing the total to 70 cars. Roofs began to be fitted to the upper decks from November 1902. When the system was converted to electric traction, the gauge was retained, as the Corporation still hoped to use the steam tram locomotives to haul coal wagons around the system. In anticipation of such a service, a branch was built from the Outlane route to Wellington Mills, owned by Martin Sons & Co. The branch reached 1245 ft above sea level near the mills. Negotiations to allow a connection from the Bradford Road route to the coal chutes at Hillhouse Sidings took rather longer, but after three years of negotiation, the London and North Western and Lancashire and Yorkshire Joint Railway finally agreed, and the connection was made. Two electric coal trams were built, each with Westinghouse motors and Westinghouse-Newall <b>magnetic</b> <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> They could carry 10 tons of coal, and were first demonstrated on 2 September 1904. Subsequently, Gosport Mill and Lindley Mill, both on the Outlane route, also took delivery of coal by the tramway. Each year around 12,000 tons of coal were delivered, and the cars covered some 9000 mi.|$|R

50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{a form of}} brakes {{unique to}} railborne vehicles.

50|$|Because of {{the risk}} of damage to the {{trackwork}} at points, etc., <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> are typically recommended for use only in emergency situations, adding their force to the main brakes (electric brakes and disc brakes), especially vital if a tram or train loses control and sanding is ineffective, or the disc brakes have failed. In practice, some rail systems (such as the MBTA Green Line in Boston, Massachusetts) use them much more frequently, to compensate for rails made slippery by weather conditions, or as a roll-back prevention measure on hills. <b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually operated by a driver’s emergency stop button mounted separately to the normal traction/brake controller, or by the release of the “dead man’s handle”. Systems which use them frequently may have a separate switch to actuate the <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> without activating other emergency stopping measures.|$|R

5000|$|The {{power of}} {{electromagnetic}} <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> comes from electromagnetic attraction between the <b>brake</b> and the <b>track.</b> They {{are intended to}} provide retardation beyond the adhesion limit of the wheels alone, which ultimately {{is limited by the}} weight of the vehicle. <b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are fitted on the bogies between each pair of wheels and in line with the running rails. In operation they are first dropped into position on the rails, using air actuators, and then current is applied to strong electromagnet coils within the shoes.
