5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no <b>money</b> <b>was</b> forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying the {{widespread}} printing of paper <b>money</b> <b>was</b> {{the beginnings of}} what one might term an early Chinese industrial revolution. For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such that, by 1078 China was producing 127000000kg (125,000t) in weight of iron per year. However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).|$|E

5|$|Bond and Vesper {{travel to}} Venice. M calls Bond {{and tells him}} the <b>money</b> <b>was</b> never deposited. Realising Vesper has stolen it, Bond pursues her and her clients into a {{building}}. The building is damaged in the struggle and begins to sink into the Grand Canal, with Vesper trapped inside. Bond kills Vesper's clients and attempts to save her, but she refuses his attempts and drowns. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.|$|E
5|$|Chris's loss on the Vortex was {{reversed}} after {{a review of}} a smaller camera underneath the Vortex that showed the ball dropping and landing milliseconds before the change in colour to red, thus the <b>money</b> <b>was</b> awarded to him— also note that the rollover still stood.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{had three}} more {{children}} with Olivia. As <b>money</b> <b>was</b> now tight, Olivia insisted that her stepchildren {{put to work}} rather than receive schooling. The Colt brothers became attached to their one surviving sister, Sarah Ann, who acted as a surrogate mother of sorts, until she was sent off to a relative's house {{to work as a}} menial. John was known to keep locks of hair belonging to her and Margaret all through his life.|$|E
40|$|The <b>money</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} the thing of having, object of desire, stimulator of lust, servant of impostures, {{but for many}} theorists of the economy <b>money</b> <b>is</b> the media for various kinds of synthesis.

5000|$|Token <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>money</b> {{whose face}} value exceeds its cost of production.

5|$|Compulsory personal, {{social and}} health {{education}} {{was introduced in}} 2009. The Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 provided parents with the option to split the year's maternity leave the mother could then take from her employment, allowing parents greater flexibility with childcare arrangements. An extension of 10–15 hours free nursery provision for disadvantaged 2-year olds was also carried out. Between 2008 and 2010, additional <b>money</b> <b>was</b> put into tax credits for families with children, while child poverty fell during Brown's last year as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of <b>money</b> <b>was</b> wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much <b>money</b> <b>was</b> spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Shubaki, former {{financial}} aide to Arafat, {{told the}} Israeli security service Shin Bet that Arafat used {{several million dollars}} of aid money to buy weapons and support militant groups. During Israel's Operation Defensive Shield, the Israel army recovered counterfeit money and documents from Arafat's Ramallah headquarters. The documents showed that, in 2001, Arafat personally approved payments to Tanzim militants. The Palestinians claimed that the counterfeit <b>money</b> <b>was</b> confiscated from criminal elements.|$|E

5|$|Gladstone {{is served}} by the Gladstone School District, which {{includes}} John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School. In 2006, a bond was passed to allow approximately $40 million worth of construction on the three schools. The majority (approx. 26 million) of the <b>money</b> <b>was</b> applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 percent on its total ($805,040), with savings to begin in the 2024 tax year.|$|E
5|$|In 1468 Orkney was pledged by Christian I, in his {{capacity}} as king of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland.

5|$|In May 2015, Hastert {{was indicted}} on federal charges of {{structuring}} bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements and {{making false statements}} to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the <b>money</b> <b>was</b> to compensate for and conceal deliberately unspecified misconduct by Hastert against an unnamed individual years earlier. Soon afterward, public accusations emerged that Hastert had sexually abused three male students (including the aforementioned unnamed individual) {{when he was a}} teacher more than three decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

5|$|In early March 1947, Formidable steamed {{north to}} Rosyth {{for a brief}} refit before being reduced to reserve. She was paid off on 12 August and a later survey {{revealed}} that her wartime damage and poor material shape meant the ship was beyond economical repair {{at a time when}} <b>money</b> <b>was</b> very tight. She was towed to Spithead in mid-1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952. Formidable was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to Inverkeithing where she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|In large part, the <b>money</b> <b>was</b> used {{to acquire}} modern aircraft, most notably, 90state-of-the-art Messerschmitt Bf 109D and E fighters from Germany in 1938for 36.6million francs, {{the last of}} which were {{delivered}} in April 1940, {{eight months after the}} outbreak of World War II. However, the need to expand the size of the pilot corps resulted in the acquisition of 146 trainers from Germany, the Bücker Bü 131 basic and Bücker Bü 133 advanced trainers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Francisco d'Anconia {{indicates the}} role of [...] "looters" [...] and [...] "moochers" [...] in relation to money: [...] "So you think that <b>money</b> <b>is</b> {{the root of all}} evil?... Have you ever asked what is the root of <b>money?</b> <b>Money</b> <b>is</b> a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. ... <b>Money</b> <b>is</b> not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or the looters who take it from you by force. <b>Money</b> <b>is</b> made possible only by the men who produce." ...|$|R
50|$|If <b>money</b> <b>is</b> a {{commodity}} to be traded, then {{all that matters}} <b>is</b> that the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> 100% backed by some commodity, like gold or silver for example. If <b>money</b> <b>is</b> credit, then {{it makes sense that}} bankers control it, as they do in the United States today. But if <b>money</b> <b>is</b> an artifact of law, whose value is derived from law (payment of taxes and legal tender laws) then Zarlenga argues it would only be proper for the government to issue, and control the money supply. According to Zarlenga, it is this last definition that is supported by the history and nature of <b>money.</b> Government-controlled <b>money</b> <b>is</b> also postulated to be more stable than credit money or commodity money.|$|R
