40|$|In {{this work}} we show a {{possible}} form of classification of comparison methods in argumentation systems [AG 95,BV,Dung 93,PRAK,Sim 92]. The main idea in these systems {{is that any}} proposition will be accepted as true if there exists an argument that supports it, and this argument is acceptable {{according to an analysis}} between it and its counterarguments. This analysis requires a process of comparison of conflicting arguments, in order to decide which one is preferable. After this dialectical analysis in the set of arguments of the system, some of them will be acceptable or justified arguments, while others not.

40|$|One {{of the key}} aspects in {{the design}} of an {{architecture}} for autonomous agents {{is the way in which}} beleifs are revised in the face of new information. An intelligent agent must be prepared to handle new information (be it sensory input, communication with other agents, etc). The areas of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Belief Revision deal with the issues of how beliefs are represented, how they are used in reasoning processes, and how a current body of beliefs reacts to the appearance of new information. There are many problems that must be solved in order to e®ectively manage a body of knowledge which, more often than not, may be incomplete or even inconsistent. The adequate solution to these problems is an essential feature of autonomy, because an agent must always be up to date in order to behave accordingly.

40|$|Multiagent systems {{provide a}} natural, {{intuitive}} {{model for a}} wide array of real world problems, where possibly heterogeneous components strive towards a common goal. Under the multiagent approach, these components can be implemented as independent agents. This ample flexibility has swayed a number of developers into adopting this scheme when dealing with industrial scale problems. On many of these systems, one can observe an striking phenomenon: the system as a whole is able to reach objectives beyond the individual capabilities of its members. For instance, suppose there are two roommates, and depict a large desk heavy enough to make changing its location an impossible task for either of them. However, the desk can be easily moved if they agree to coordinate their effort. This simple example underscores the important role of the interaction among agents in these systems. This interaction, when conducted in an orderly fashion, increases the potential of the system as a whole.

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore the {{inclusion}} of the notion of multiple argument conflicts, those in which two or more arguments are involved. In formal systems of defeasible argumentation, arguments for and against a proposition are produced and evaluated to verify the acceptability of that proposition. The development of argumentation systems has grown in the last years [AG 95, BV, Dung 93, PRAK, Sim 92, GS 99] but no consensus has been reached yet on some issues, such as the representation of arguments, the way they interact, and the output of that interaction. Even then, the main idea in these systems is that any proposition will be accepted as true if there exists an argument that supports it, and this argument is acceptable according to an analysis between it and its counterarguments. Therefore, in the set of arguments of the system, some of them will be acceptable or justified arguments, while others not. Almost every system of this kind is based on the notion of binary conflicts between arguments. We consider here the existence of a more complex form of conflict, how to solve it, and the corresponding acceptability semantic.

40|$|Após considerações iniciais sobre inteligência, um estudo comparativo entre inteligência biológica e <b>inteligência</b> <b>artificial</b> é feito. Os especialistas em <b>Inteligência</b> <b>Artificial</b> são de opinião que inteligência é simplesmente uma matéria de manipulação de símbolos físicos. Neste sentido, o objetivo da <b>Inteligência</b> <b>Artificial</b> é entender como a inteligência {{cerebral}} funciona em termos de conceitos e técnicas de engenharia. De modo diverso os filósofos da ciência acreditam que os computadores podem ter uma sintaxe, porém não têm uma semântica. No presente trabalho é ressaltado que o complexo cérebro/mente constitui um sistema monolítico, que funciona com funções emergentes em vários níveis de organização hierárquica. Esses níveis hierárquicos não são redutíveis um ao outro. Eles são, no mínimo, três (neuronal, funcional e semântico) e funcionam dentro de um plano interacional. Do ponto de vista epistemológico, o complexo cérebro/mente se utiliza de mecanismos lógicos e não-lógicos para lidar com os problemas do dia-a-dia. A lógica é necessária para o processo do pensamento, porém não é suficiente. Ênfase é dada aos mecanismos não-lógicos (lógica nebulosa, heurística, raciocínio intuitivo), os quais permitem à mente desenvolver estratégias para encontrar soluções. After brief considerations about intelligence, {{a comparative}} study between biologic and artificial intelligence is made. The specialists in Artificial Intelligence found that intelligence is purely {{a matter of}} physical symbol manipulation. The enterprise of Artificial Intelligence aims to understand {{what we might call}} Brain Intelligence in terms of concepts and techniques of engineering. However the philosophers believed that computer-machine can have syntax, but can never have semantics. In other words, that they can follow rules, such as those of arithmetic or grammar, but not understand what to us are meanings of symbols, such as words. In the present paper it is stressed that brain/mind complex constitutes a monolithic system that functions with emergent properties at several levels of hierarchical organization. These hierarchical levels are non-reducible to one another. They are at least three (neuronal, functional, and semantic), and they function within an interactional plan. The brain/ mind complex, which transform informations in meanings, deals with problems by means of both logical and non-logical mechanisms; while logic allows the mind to arrange the elements for reasoning, the non-logical mechanisms (fuzzy logic, heuristics, insights) allows the mind to develop strategies to find solutions. The model for construction of the "intelligent machine" is the operating way of the brain/mind complex, which does not always use logical processes.

40|$|A multiagent system (MAS) {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} interacting autonomous agents. It {{can be viewed as a}} society in which each agent performs its activity, cooperating to achieve common goals, or competing for them. Thus, every agent has the ability to do social interactions with other agents establishing dialogues via some kind of agent-communication language, under some communication protocol [13]. Argumentation has been used to model several kind of dialogues in multi-agents systems, such as negotiation or coordination [1, 7, 8, 5, 9]. Our current research activities are related to the use of argumentation in agent’s interaction, as a form of social dialogue. According to [15], dialogues can be classified in negotiation, where there is a conflict of interests, persuasion where there is a conflict of opinion or beliefs, indagation where there is a need for an explanation or proof of some proposition, deliberation or coordination where there is a need to coordinate goals and actions, and one special kind of dialogue called eristic based on personal conflicts. Except the last one, all this dialogues may exist in multi-agents systems as part of social activities among agents. We also study the use of argumentation formalisms to model the internal process of reasoning of an agent, often called monologues. Our aim is to define an abstract argumentation framework to capture the behaviour of these different dialogues. We are not interested in the logic used to construct arguments. Our formulation completely abstracts from the internal structure of the arguments, considering them as moves made in a dialogue. We also consider multiagent systems as a set {{of multiple}} interacting autonomous agents.

40|$|Current {{reasoning}} systems {{attempt to}} model an agent's knowledge and interaction with its environment in a symbolic manner. This environment, its world is generally dynamic and changing due to natural evolution or {{the actions of}} other agents that {{are a part of}} it. In consequence, an agent that is a part of a reasoning system must have the following components: a knowledge base where its knowledge of the world is stored, a communication mechanism with the environment and other agents in it, and a means of modifying its knowledge of the environment. Knowledge may be represented by a logic language which is propositional, first order, modal or extentions of these. Each one of these alternatives has advantages as well as disadvantages. The higher the expressive power of a given language, the more computational problems there are regarding complexity and decidability. Communication mechanisms can be varied, depending on the environment being modeled. They can be multimedia mechanisms such as microphones, speakers, video cameras, infrared sensors, motion detectors and even wired or wireless systems where information is transmitted without any kind of preprocessing. They are irrelevant, however, for the purpose of our research because we are focused {{in the development of the}} knowledge system. Mechanisms for modifying knowledge may be modeled by what is known as Belief Change Theory. Belief Change Theory assumes that the underlying language is at least propositional. An agent's knowledge is represented as a set of sentences and new information as a single sentence. In turn, every change operator takes a set of sentences and a single sentence and produces a new set of sentences as a result.

40|$|Simply put, a multiagent {{system can}} be {{understood}} as a collection of autonomous agents able to accomplish as a whole goals beyond the capabilities of any of its members. The traditional example depicts a heavy armchair that can be easily lifted by coordinating the effort of a group of persons despite that none of them {{would have been able to}} pick it up alone. Thus, one might argue that precisely the agent interaction is boosting the system performance. Since this interaction comes in several flavors, the literature has already explored notions such as agent coordination, cooperation, and collaboration in the context of multiagent systems. This extended abstract outlines our own understanding on this matter, summarizing the evolution of an abstract model for the particular kind of agent interaction known as deliberation. A group of agents deliberate whenever they need to come to a mutually accepted position about some issue. This interaction among agents has drawn our attention given its ubiquity: we believe that complex interactions such as coordination or cooperation might be attained as a result of accruing one or more deliberations. Our proposal is inspired after the novel trend of reinterpreting agent interaction as if it were the result of an argumentation process. For instance, several authors [2, 3, 5, 13, 14] have recently considered recasting the main aspects of multiagent negotiation in terms of defeasible argumentation. We follow a like approach in developing our model after a set of dialectical concepts borrowed from that same area. Our approach also strives for generality, mainly after Dung's ample success with his notion of argumentative framework due to its abstract nature. In consequence, we too have decided to pursue an abstract model.

40|$|Artificial Intelligence {{has long}} {{dealt with the}} issue of finding a {{suitable}} formalization for reasoning with incomplete and potentially inconsistent information. Defeasible argumentation [SL 92,CML 00,PraVre 99] {{has proven to be a}} successful approach in many respects, since it naturally resembles many aspects of commonsense reasoning (see [CML 00,PraVre 99] for details). Besides, recent work [PraVre 99,BDKT 97] has shown that defeasible argumentation constitutes a confluence point for characterizing many different approaches to non-monotonic reasoning. Nevertheless, the evolution of different, alternative formalisms for modeling argumentation has resulted in a number of models that share some common features (the notion of argument, attack between arguments, defeat, dialectical analysis, etc.). This constitutes a motivation for the definition of a unified ontology, under which these different features can be analyzed and inter-related. As a byproduct from such an ontology, a classification (or taxonomy) of argumentation frameworks in terms of knowledge encoding capabilities, expressive power, etc. would be possible. In [Che 01] a logical framework for defeasible argumentation called SDEAR was developed. The SDEAR framework is based on labelled deductive systems [Gab 96]. Labelled Deductive Systems offer an attractive approach to formalizing complex logical systems, since they allow to characterize the different components involved by using different sorts of labels. One of the motivations for developing this framework was namely the definition of a single, unified ontology to capture the main issues involved in defeasible argumentation by specifying a suitable underlying logical language and its associated inference rules. In this presentation we focus on a particular research line which emerged from the above formalization, namely the classification of different defeasible argumentation frameworks based on features that can be ‘abstracted away’ in the SDEAR framework. The presentation is structured as follows: first, in section 2, we will briefly sketch how the SDEAR framework works. Then, in section 3 we will describe how different argumentation frameworks can be interrelated through SDEAR. Finally, section 4 concludes.

40|$|Most formalisms for {{representing}} common-sense knowledge allow {{incomplete and}} potentially inconsistent information. When strong negation is also allowed, contradictory conclusions can arise. A criterion for deciding {{between them is}} needed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate an inherent and autonomous comparison criterion, based on specificity as defined in [19, 22]. In contrast to other approaches, we consider not only defeasible, but also strict knowledge. Our criterion is context-sensitive, i. e. preference among defeasible rules is determined dynamically during the dialectical analysis. We show how specificity can be defined in terms of two different approaches: activation sets and derivation trees. This allows us to get a more syntactic criterion that can be implemented in a computationally attractive way. The resulting definitions may be applied in general rule-based formalisms. We present theorems linking both characterizations.

Furthermore, we analyze to what extent common sense knowledge arises as a limit on the scope of mechanical models of artificial intelligence (AI). With these objectives in view, we first present the pseudo dichotomy episteme / doxa assumed by the philosophical tradition, highlighting the influence of this tradition in contemporary areas of research on the mind such as cognitive science and artificial intelligence. As an alternative to this kind of dichotomous epistemology, we present some epistemologically continuist philosophical tendencies such as the proposals of T. Reid, G. Moore, J. Dewey, and G. Ryle. In this tradition, common sense knowledge is understood as cognitively efficient in the context of everyday life, especially in activities in which we do not have complete conscious and intentional control. Based on this initial discussion of the cognitive capacities of common sense knowledge, we analyze the critiques of Dreyfus and Searle of traditional models of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. We highlight some of the arguments of these authors that are directed at AI and at the limits and boundaries that the area confronts in terms of modeling programs that can demonstrate knowledge of common sense. We argue that part of this difficulty is due to the inability of such models to play the decisive role of embodiment in cognitive processes. Finally, we present the embodied and embedded cognition (EEC) approach, which seeks to overcome the difficulties pointed to above by taking into account in its models the cognitive relevance of embodiment, world/organism interaction, and experience, among other things.

40|$|Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP) is an {{extension}} of Logic Programming capturing common-sense reasoning features. The DeLP language can manage defeasible reasoning, allowing the representation of defeasible and non- defeasible knowledge. Since DeLP syntax is based on a PROLOG-like notation, the task of writing a DeLP program {{is similar to that of}} writing a Prolog one. Hence, writing a DeLP program could be hard for someone unfamiliar with this kind of syntax. In this paper we present a window-based system that assists a user in the writing of DeLP programs. The system allows the user lo write sentences in restricted English and then translates these sentences to DeLP syntax. The system is strongly based on a natural language interpretation module for translating a subset of English to DeLP. The translator has the capability of learning new words directly from the sentences being parsed. Thus, the system lexicon is built dynamically while the program is being written.

Object {{oriented}} constraint programs (OOCPs) {{emerge as}} a leading evolution of constraint programming and artificial intelligence, first applied {{to a range of}} industrial applications called configuration problems. The rich variety of technical approaches to solving configuration problems (CLP(FD), CC(FD), DCSP, Terminological systems, constraint programs with set variables, [...] .) is a source of difficulty. No universally accepted formal language exists for communicating about OOCPs, which makes the comparison of systems difficult. We present here a Z based specification of OOCPs which avoids the falltrap of hidden object semantics. The object system is part of the specification, and captures all of the most advanced notions from the object oriented modeling standard UML. The paper illustrates these issues and the conciseness and precision of Z by the specification of a working OOCP that solves an historical AI problem: parsing a context free grammar. Being written in Z, an OOCP specification also supports formal proofs. The whole builds the foundation of an adaptative and evolving framework for communicating about constrained object models and programs.

40|$|Apache Spark is {{a general}} purpose big data {{processing}} framework using the mapreduce paradigm, quickly becoming very popular. Although the information provided by Spark authors indicates a substantial improvement in performance against Hadoop, {{there is very little}} evidence in the literature of specific tests that reliably proves such claims. In this Master Work study the benefits of Spark and the most important factors on which they depend, considering as a reference the transformation of RDF datasets into HDT format. The main objective of this work is to perform one exploratory study to leverage Spark solving the HDT serialization problem, finding ways to remove limitations of the current implementations, like the memory need which use to increase with the dataset size. To do that, first we’ve setup a open environment to ensure reproducibility and contributed with 3 different approaches implementing the most heavy task in the HDT serialization. The test performed with different dataset sizes showed the benefits obtained with the proposed solution compared to legacy Hadoop MapReduce implementation, as well as some highlights to improve even more the serialization algorithm.

40|$|Disjunctive logic {{programs}} have been studied {{in order to increase}} expressivity, especially in representing indefinite information. Even though there is no general consensus on any specific semantic for disjunctive logic programs with negation, most of well known semantics are minimal model based. Sometimes real applications need to capture non minimal models, {{in spite of the fact}} that they contain redundant information. In representing disjunctive knowledge, for instance, minimal approaches capture exclusive disjunction but they cannot managed the inclusive meaning. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the expressive power of a special combination of disjunctive logic programming, negation as failure (NAF), and strong negation. This class of programs are syntactically uniform, since both kinds of negation are allowed to appear in the head and in the body of a rule, and its semantics allows non minimal models. We introduce a non injective syntactic transformation of disjunctive logic programs with NAF in head into disjunctive logic programs without NAF in head, in order to compare semantically both class of programs. Finally, we prove that the set of answer sets of the transformed disjunctive logic program is strictly included in the set of minimal answer sets of the original program and we discuss its consequences.

Área de Ciencias de la Computación e <b>Inteligencia</b> <b>Artificial.</b> Background: The {{explosion}} in biological information creates {{the need for}} databases {{that are easy to}} develop, easy to maintain and can be easily manipulated by annotators {{who are most likely to}} be biologists. However, deployment of scalable and extensible databases is not an easy task and generally requires substantial expertise in database development. Results: BioBuilder is a Zope-based software tool that was developed to facilitate intuitive creation of protein databases. Protein data can be entered and annotated through web forms along with the flexibility to add customized annotation features to protein entries. A built-in review system permits a global team of scientists to coordinate their annotation efforts. We have already used BioBuilder to develop Human Protein Reference Database [URL] a comprehensive annotated repository of the human proteome. The data can be exported in the extensible markup language (XML) format, which is rapidly becoming as the standard format for data exchange. Conclusions: As the proteomic data for several organisms begins to accumulate, BioBuilder will prove to be an invaluable platform for functional annotation and development of customizable protein centric databases. BioBuilder is open source and is available under the terms of LGP...|$|R
