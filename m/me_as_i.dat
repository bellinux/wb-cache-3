25|$|It was a {{pitch to}} sell Ladd to women filmgoers, {{though he had}} not changed one iota {{and he did not}} have a {{noticeable}} romantic aura. But Paramount hoped that women might feel that beneath the rock-like expression there smouldered fires of passion, or something like. His black-lashed eyes, however, gave nothing away; it was 'take <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am' or 'I'm the boss around here'. He never flirted nor even seemed interested (which is one of the reasons he and Lake were so effective together).|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, {{and in the morning}} we bowed around the family altar. It was not an {{exciting}} occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E

He {{is a fan of}} the Australian rugby league club the Wests Tigers. He is also a fan of singer Julio Iglesias. As Field's fitness improved, to the point that his training regimen became comparable to that of an elite athlete, he gained an interest in gymnastics and acrobatics.|$|E

I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E
500|$|Ling is {{not above}} using her {{ethnicity}} {{as a means}} of gaining advantage. [...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|In old age, Bush {{continued}} to lead {{an active and}} productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations {{of his life and}} works. [...] In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the Twenty-four Preludes, Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977. A later [...] reviewer described this piece as [...] "music I'd like to have playing beside <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sprawled on the grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon".|$|E

500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and it occurred to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{was in the room}} as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Judge Me" [...] is a midtempo ballad {{that runs}} {{for three minutes}} and fifteen seconds, with {{instrumentation}} provided by drums. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] features [...] "a slow, sensuous romp", which she found reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you." [...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The one that you can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics. Rolling Stones Maura Johnston described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as [...] "a tender love song," [...] Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-08-16}} while Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine referred to it as a [...] "take <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am" [...] type of ballad. Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] is similar to Brown's 2009 song, [...] "Changed Man." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am?" ...|$|E

500|$|After Louisbourg, {{the company}} was {{stationed}} first at Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick), and then at Fort St. Anne, where {{the company was}} part of a campaign against Indians and Acadians that had taken refuge there from the ongoing expulsion of the Acadians. [...] These raids were sometimes quite brutal; the company was known to scalp Acadian settlers. [...] In one particularly brutal incident, Hazen was responsible for the scalping of six men, and the burning of four others, along with two women and three children, in a house he set on fire. [...] Joseph Bellefontaine, a leader of the local militia and the father of one of the women, claimed that he was forced to witness this event in an attempt to coerce his cooperation with the rangers. [...] (Bellefontaine escaped into the woods with two of his grandchildren.) [...] General Jeffrey Amherst, who did not hear of the incident until after he had promoted Hazen to captain, noted, [...] "I am sorry that to say what I have since heard of that affair has sullied his merit with <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> shall always disapprove of killing women and helpless children." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} chorus, the lead guitar {{alternates}} with Bono's repeated [...] "Time" [...] into the B–A bridge {{before returning to}} an extended chorus. The vocals range from D3 in the verses to a peak of C5 in the chorus. The Edge provides backing vocals in the second verse, the first three chorus lines, and the bridge lyric [...] "Time won't leave <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am / Time won't take the boy out of this man". There is no chorus after the third verse; instead, the track enters into a coda where, after restating the introductory piano theme, the guitar, bass, and drum parts come to a finish. The song concludes on a final reprise of the piano notes. The radio edit, with a run-time of 4:11, is 1:36 shorter than the album version. The introduction is half the length and the bass and drums enter after only two repetitions of the piano notes. The first two verses are kept intact but the bridge is shortened by seven seconds, removing two calls of [...] "Time." [...] The third verse is cut and the coda shortened by twenty seconds.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for his appearance on Question Time, Griffin researched the first appearance of Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams. In {{an e-mail to}} BNP supporters, Griffin said [...] "Never before have we {{had the chance to}} present our patriotic, common sense solutions to Britain's nightmare situation to the public at large in such prominent fashion ... I am relishing this opportunity, and I [...] know that ... the ordinary members, supporters and voters of the BNP will [...] be in the studio with <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> take on the corrupt, treacherous swine [...] destroying our beautiful island nation." [...] Contrasting to Griffin's earlier 2001 appearance on HARDtalk and later appearances on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman, Griffin claimed that he was non-combative in his Question Time appearance in order to gain sympathy from the viewers via a [...] "root-for-the-underdog mentality". He had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of the programme with him appearing as a panellist, which did not occur. However, he also stated in a letter on the BNP website: [...] "I will, no doubt, be interrupted, shouted down, slandered, put on the spot, and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists. It will, in other words, be political blood sport. But I am relishing this opportunity." ...|$|E
