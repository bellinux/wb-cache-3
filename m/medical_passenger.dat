The airline prospered as it provided a vast network of <b>medical,</b> <b>passenger</b> and mail services throughout the Northern Territory, although it would eventually collapse following a decision by then Northern Territory Chief Minister Paul Everingham, a political opponent of Calder, to give competing airline Ansett Airlines {{the rights to the}} Darwin-Alice Springs route. Not content with this, Calder also took on the challenge of managing cattle stations the size of some European countries.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, the U.S. Air Force {{identified}} {{a need for}} an aeromedical transport aircraft and ordered C-9A Nightingale aircraft the following year. Deliveries began in 1968. The U.S. Air Force received 21 C-9A aircraft from 1968 to 1969. [...] The C-9As were used for <b>medical</b> evacuation, <b>passenger</b> transportation, and special missions from 1968 to 2005. The C-9A were named for English social reformer Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), the founder of modern nursing.|$|R

40|$|Approximately 1. 5 to 2 billion {{passengers}} {{fly on the}} world's {{civil aircraft}} each year. As the population ages, the number of air travellers increases and longer routes are flown by bigger aircraft, the number of <b>medical</b> events involving <b>passengers</b> is anticipated to increase. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence, nature, type and extent of medical problems and injuries occurring in passengers on board civil registered aircraft. The aim, in particular, was to determine the most common in-flight <b>medical</b> problems in <b>passengers,</b> and what proportion of these events result in an aircraft diversion. A search of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident and incident database was conducted for medical conditions and injuries in passengers between 1 January 1975 and 31 March 2006. There were 284 <b>passenger</b> <b>medical</b> events and injuries (defined as 15 accidents, one serious incident and 268 incidents). These events accounted for only 0. 18 of a percentage point of all the occurrences listed on the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's database. In-flight deaths accounted for only 3 per cent of the total passenger injury events. The most common cause of in-flight death, at 44 per cent, was heart attack. Serious injuries accounted for slightly more than a third of reported occurrences. Minor injuries accounted for the majority of cases, at 53 per cent. The most common <b>medical</b> event in <b>passengers</b> was minor musculoskeletal injury (26 per cent of cases). Ninety-five flights were diverted (33 per cent). Of the known medical conditions, heart attack was the most common reason for an aircraft diversion (33 cases out of 95), followed by a fitting episode (in six cases). The results of this study are consistent with other published international experience. There is a low risk of passengers sustaining either an injury or a medical event as a consequence of travel on a civil aircraft...|$|R
5|$|Although sales {{never fully}} recovered, the {{improved}} Comet2 and the prototype Comet3 {{culminated in the}} redesigned Comet4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30years. The Comet was adapted {{for a variety of}} military roles such as VIP, <b>medical</b> and <b>passenger</b> transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.|$|R

50|$|A man {{was hospitalized}} April 26, 2010 {{after he was}} hit by a light rail while talking on a cell phone.The crash {{happened}} near the Iron Point Station in Folsom at about 10 a.m. Investigators said the pedestrian was walking on the tracks and not paying attention to what was coming toward him. The pedestrian on the tracks never looked up at all throughout the entire incident. The operator told investigators that he had spoken to the injured person, and the guy said that he was walking on the tracks because he didn't want to be walking on the roadway while talking on his cell phone. The pedestrian was in serious condition at UC Davis <b>Medical</b> Center. <b>Passengers</b> on the train had an hour delay.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War, Australian {{war crimes}} {{investigators}} investigated if the I-177 and its Commander Nakagawa were responsible for sinking the Australian Hospital Ship Centaur. The Centaur was torpedoed off the Australian east coast on 14 May 1943. The torpedo ignited a fuel tank setting the ship ablaze. It rolled to port and sank within three minutes. Of the 332 crew, patients, <b>medical</b> staff and <b>passengers</b> on board, 268 died - only 64 were rescued.|$|R
50|$|Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of Czechoslovakia in 1993, it was initially intended to transform Slov-Air in the flag carrier of Slovakia. These plans were dropped, when with Slovak Airlines an all-new state airline was created in 1995. Slov-Air was dismantled over the following years and split up into several independent companies for agricultural, <b>medical,</b> military and <b>passenger</b> services, most notably Aero Slovakia. The airline license of Slov-Air was officially revoked only in 2001, though.|$|R
50|$|Mattaponi {{spent almost}} all of World War II in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters. From her {{commissioning}} until December 1942 she carried fuel from the Texas oil ports to the U.S. Navy's fuel storage depots at Craney Island, Yorktown, Newport, Boston, and Casco Bay. On 12 December she departed New York Harbor {{for the first of}} 21 wartime transatlantic convoys. Often she carried, in addition to her cargo fuels, landing craft, aircraft, provisions, mail, <b>medical</b> supplies, and <b>passengers.</b> Her <b>medical</b> complement as well as her engineers and mechanics were often called on, at sea and in port, to remedy malfunctions, human and mechanical, on board other ships.|$|R
50|$|It is the abnormal, {{non-routine}} flight where {{landing weight}} {{can be a}} problem. If a flight takes off at the maximum takeoff weight and then faces a situation where it must return to the departure airport (due to certain mechanical problems, or a <b>passenger</b> <b>medical</b> problem for instance), {{there will not be}} time to consume the fuel meant for getting to the original destination, and the aircraft may exceed the maximum landing weight to land at the departure point. If an aircraft lands at more than its maximum allowable weight it might suffer structural damage, or even break apart on landing. At the very least, an overweight landing would require a thorough inspection for damage.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{this year}} I {{was part of}} a medical team that {{delivered}} a full-term baby on a cruise ship [1]. It went well and was in all respects a joyous event. But afterward we were all thinking: ‘What if…. ’- because the potential for disaster was substantial: There had been no prenatal care, fetal monitoring during delivery was not possible, and surgical intervention could not be done if anything had gone wrong. Cruise companies are in the transport and entertainment business, not in the health business. Their vessels are not floating hospitals, and the medical facilities aboard can not be compared with modern shore-side hospitals [2]. There is no international body that regulates medical care on cruise ships. Filling a need, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) published in 1996 ‘Guidelines of Care for Cruise Ship Medical facilities’. It states that the cruise ships’ medical facilities are there to provide emergency <b>medical</b> care for <b>passengers</b> and crew,...|$|R
30|$|Further {{down the}} line, {{recovered}} (i.e. imaged) sources {{can be used}} in different ways, especially if the DARE project involves the imaging of the entire source, not simply the data element. As meteorological data and narrative description are often, though not always, found within the same historic source material, imaging the original source has great potential for scholars across many fields. This was the case for a major project carried out in 2008 by the British Library in conjunction with ACRE, CDMP and the University of Sunderland (Brohan et al. 2012; Freeman and Ross 2009). The project focused on weather observations made in log books from the British East India Company held at the British Library India Office. Images were made of the whole book page which meant that not only was the weather information preserved but the context. The logs offer a fascinating account of life at sea, including <b>medical</b> practices, <b>passenger</b> lists, botany, and explorations of new lands to name but a few. Other examples of joint-working on DARE activities are the CLIWOC and RECLAIM projects. 6 These linked projects imaged logs held at Britain’s National Maritime Museum (NMM) and National Archive from ships that travelled from Britain across the globe (Wilkinson 2010). These log books were kept by ship’s captains, or in some cases a first mate, who were required to make sub-daily observations of the weather. Log books are a vast resource, covering private as well as national shipping organisations, merchant fleets and national navies (Nash and Adamson 2013; Wheeler 2009). In the above-mentioned cases, research teams comprised historians, geographers and climatologists.|$|R
40|$|Air travel poses <b>medical</b> {{challenges}} to <b>passengers</b> with respiratory disease, principally because {{of exposure to}} a hypobaric environment. In 2002 the British Thoracic Society published recommendations for adults and children with respiratory disease planning air travel, with a web update in 2004. New full recommendations and a summary were published in 2011, containing key recommendations {{for the assessment of}} high-risk patients and identification of those likely to require in-flight supplemental oxygen. This paper highlights the aspects of particular relevance to primary care practitioners with the following key points: (1) At cabin altitudes of 8000 feet (the usual upper limit of in-flight cabin pressure, equivalent to 0. 75 atmospheres) the partial pressure of oxygen falls to the equivalent of breathing 15. 1 % oxygen at sea level. Arterial oxygen tension falls in all passengers; in patients with respiratory disease, altitude may worsen preexisting hypoxaemia. (2) Altitude exposure also influences the volume of any air in cavities, where pressure x volume remain constant (Boyle's law), so that a pneumothorax or closed lung bulla will expand and may cause respiratory distress. Similarly, barotrauma may affect the middle ear or sinuses if these cavities fail to equilibrate. (3) Patients with respiratory disease require clinical assessment and advice before air travel to: (a) optimise usual care; (b) consider contraindications to travel and possible need for in-flight oxygen; (c) consider the need for secondary care referral for further assessment; (d) discuss the risk of venous thromboembolism; and (e) discuss forward planning for the journey...|$|R
40|$|Irregular {{operations}} involve {{disruption of}} scheduled airline operations. They ate {{of concern to}} the carriers because they cost money, require personnel effort, and may harm customer good will. Irregular operations may result from aircraft system malfunctions that take planes out of service or result in cancellations, Might system problems or <b>passenger</b> <b>medical</b> emergencies that require diversions, local airport problems that may close down a runway, or weather systems that restrict flow into airports or regions. At the heart of responding to irregular operations is distributed decision making by members of airline operations centers, pilots, and the air traffic control system. Six U. S. carriers participated in a study in which we observed strategies used by operations center personnel to handle various classes of irregular operations. We focused on situations that are most disruptive to regular operations and are most difficult to cope with. We also sought to identify classes of events that would be most affected by changes in the air traffic management system. How a carrier deals with disruptions to its schedule reflects its philosophy and primary goals, {{as well as its}} resources. Size and type of operations (short or long-haul) determine which problems have priority. Each airline has different technological support tools to aid in flight planning and replanning, and some carriers have established contingency procedures for coping with various situations. We also examined differences in extent and type of interaction between ABC personnel and various elements of the air traffic system as they managed various problems: who interacts with AM what situations prompt interaction, how often these occur, and the outcomes and Perceived benefits. Use of the expanded NRP program was also studied, along with its advantages to the individual companies. We also examined the implications of the proposed change to a free flight environment on airline strategies for coping with irregular operations...|$|R
40|$|Saturday, December 29, 2007, 19 : 35 EST (07 : 35 PM EST) CDCHAN- 00267 - 2007 - 12 - 29 -ADV-NThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{is working}} with international, state, and local health {{officials}} and other partners on an investigation involving an international traveler to the U. S. who had recently been diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). CDC was informed in mid-December 2007 by a local health authority that a patient who had been diagnosed in India with MDR TB traveled from New Delhi, India to Chicago, Illinois on December 13, 2007 on American Airlines Flight # 293 and then on a shorter flight within the United States. Shortly after final arrival, the patient sought treatment for hemoptysis, fever, and chest pain at a hospital. These and other findings indicated a potential for transmission of drug-resistant TB infection to others. The patient has been hospitalized in airborne isolation and is receiving treatment for TB. Shortly after being notified about the patient and her travels, officials of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine contacted American Airlines and U. S. Customs and Border Protection to obtain the information needed to contact passengers {{who may have been}} exposed to the traveler with tuberculosis. CDC is collaborating with U. S. state and local health departments, the Indian Ministry of Family Welfare, American Airlines, and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection to ensure notification and follow-up of passengers and crew who may have been exposed to MDR TB. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) TB and Airline Travel Guidelines, CDC is ensuring appropriate follow-up and care for persons who may have been exposed to TB on an aircraft. This includes recommending the evaluation and testing of passengers and crew with closest contact to the patient on board American Airlines Flight # 293 departing from New Delhi, India on December 13, 2007 and arriving in Chicago, Illinois on December 13, 2007. This includes 44 passengers. These were the passengers seated in the same row as the index patient (row 35), and those seated in the two rows ahead (rows 33 and 34) and the two rows behind (rows 36 and 37), as well as the crew members working in the same cabin. These persons should receive an initial evaluation and testing for TB infection, with follow-up 8 to 10 weeks after the December 13 flight for reevaluation. CDC recommends testing of these passengers and crew on only the international flight from New Delhi to Chicago because this flight was longer than the 8 hour duration criteria specified by WHO for passenger testing for exposure to tuberculosis. WHO and CDC do not recommend notification or <b>medical</b> evaluation of <b>passengers</b> on briefer flights because the risk of transmission is minimal.
