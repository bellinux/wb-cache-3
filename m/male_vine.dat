3000|$|As {{seen in the}} {{pedigree}} (Figure  1), there were 19 ancestors of the 21 parents whose crosses were used in this analysis. Assuming that founder vines had no inbreeding, none of the female parents was inbred and of the 18 males (numbered 28 – 31 & 33 – 46), the male 31 had the highest degree of inbreeding (F[*]=[*] 0.25; its parents were full-sibs of unrelated ancestors 17 and 4). Male parent 37 descended from a cross between the <b>male</b> <b>vine</b> 20 and its brother’s (17) daughter (GT), which resulted in an F value of 0.125. Similarly, the male parents 41 – 46, which were full-sibs and whose parents (23 and 22) were half-sibs of the common female ancestor 4 (Figure  1), had an F value of 0.125.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The vine mealybug, Planococcus ficus (Signoret) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) is a pest with {{significant}} economic {{impact on the}} grape growing industry in South Africa {{and other parts of}} the world. With the isolation and synthesizing of the vine mealybug sex pheromone in 2001, new control options for the integrated management of the vine mealybug have been created. The status of sex pheromone monitoring as a tool in the integrated management of the vine mealybug has been evaluated from different perspectives. A significant quantitative difference in <b>male</b> <b>vine</b> mealybug trap catch numbers has been observed between wine and table grape vineyards and results indicated that there were differences in the susceptibility of grape cultivars to vine mealybug. Currently, the delta trap design is the accepted trap design for vine mealybug monitoring. No studies have yet been conducted to determine the optimum trap parameters like size or design. Population pressure may have an influence on the qualitative efficiency of various trap designs. The basis for degree-day forecasting models has been established adequately. However, refinements need to be done and the incorporation of factors such as humidity and regionality also need to be considered. Daily maximum temperatures fluctuating around the upper developmental threshold temperature for prolonged periods of time seemed to suppress population numbers. Different vineyard management practices exist for wine and table grape production. While an action threshold of 65 vine mealybug males per trap per two-week period seems an acceptable threshold for table grape production, it may not be appropriate for wine grape (or raisin grape) production. Using sex pheromone traps for population monitoring is a valid technique in the arsenal of management tactics against the vine mealybug. However, refinements and validation of research results must be done further to build credibility into the monitoring system. Master...|$|E

40|$|In 1988 and 1989, {{flowers were}} removed before opening from all pollenizers (<b>male</b> <b>vines)</b> except that {{closest to the}} middle of an orchard block 76 m long and 24 m wide, {{containing}} 140 vines at 4 m X 4 m spacing. Fruit set decreased from 100 % in vines nearest the central male to 17 % in 1988 and to only 7 % in 1989 in the most distant vines. Mean fruit weight for each vine decreased from 110 to 34 g in 1988 and from 113 to 37 g in 1989, fruit weight decreasing the further the vine was from the pollen source. As a consequence, yield progressively decreased from vines adjacent to the pollenizer (54. 9 and 58. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively) to those most distant (3. 7 and 1. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively). The area covered by a pollenizer, i. e. the area within which plants produce at least half the number of seeds of those closest to the pollenizer, was 229 m 2 in 1988 and 103 m 2 in 1989. Since pollen transfer, rather than its availability, is the main factor limiting pollination, to achieve full pollination about 118 pollen sources ha- 1 must be provided in kiwifruit orchards, without regard to planting distances and canopy sizes. <b>Male</b> <b>vines</b> occupy too much canopy space and it is suggested that they be eliminated; instead, sectors of female vines at appropriate positions in the orchard should be grafted with male scionwood...|$|R
40|$|Kiwifruit {{breeding}} programmes in New Zealand {{have produced a}} large number of seedling populations. Effective methods are required to assess seedlings, and knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic variation would facilitate the design of {{breeding programmes}}. 1. Multivariate analyses of phenotypic data Multivariate analyses were used to quantify the characters most powerful in distinguishing between seedlings and between crosses, and to examine their relationships. Seedlings and crosses were placed in order of their overall merit, and the best ones were determined. Bruno was a superior female parent for producing both floriferous <b>male</b> <b>vines</b> and productive female vines with high fruit vitamin C content, and D 1 - 20 was the better male parent in all crosses. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were more suitable to sort cross combinations, while factor analysis was more efficient for screening single seedlings within a population. Factor patterns varied between crosses, and between years for the same cross. Canonical correlation analysis proved a useful tool to obtain better understanding of the aggregates of useful vine characters and the relationship between them in fruit breeding. 2. Quantitative genetics studies Relatively high heritability was shown for the beginning date of bloom (0. 48) and flowering duration (0. 50) in <b>male</b> <b>vines,</b> and total crop weight (0. 46), percentage of shoots flowering (0. 54), fruit elongation (0. 65), and mean fruit weight (0. 52) in female vines. For these traits, the selection of superior seedlings as parent could therefore lead to rapid genetic improvement to their subsequent generations. Hairiness of fruit (- 0. 07) and percentage soluble solids in fruit (- 0. 19) gave negative heritability value, thus could not be improved efficiently by individual selection. However, their broad sense heritability was reasonably high (0. 22 and 0. 37 respectively), showing there were some dominant and/or epistatic effects involved. This indicates a possible chance improvement may occur in a large seedling population. Fruit vitamin C content (0. 22), fruit symmetry (0. 30) and relative core size (0. 13) gave moderate or low heritability values, indicating that individual selection may have only moderate success in improving these traits. Simple recurrent individual selection was shown to be an effective breeding strategy for characters of high heritability. For characters of low heritability, the family selection methods yielded a greater rate of genetic gain. Selection indices were constructed to provide a technique for improving several traits simultaneously. 3. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of leaf proteins Three regions of the protein profile were found useful for the characterisation of cultivars and seedlings. The banding patterns found in seedlings provided evidence that in the hexaploid kiwifruit the inheritance of these polypeptides occurred {{in a manner similar to}} that of a diploid. Hence the kiwifruit may have arisen as a diploidized polyploid and it is proposed the kiwifruit may be considered as allohexaploid. Progressive changes of some bands with leaf growth and development may be of interest in the study of leaf development. The possible application of leaf protein analysis to kiwifruit breeding was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vitis coignetiae Pulliat {{is one of}} the {{naturally}} growing {{grape vines}} in the Japanese Islands, of which the fruit has been utilized as a healthy juice and wine. In Hiruzen Highlands, the vines have been cultivated for wine making since the 1980 's. We have studied the physiology of berry set and berry maturation of the vines to improve the fruit production and fruit quality for last 14 seasons. V. coignetiae vines are dioecious and need insect pollination, mainly by two species of Diptera, Eristalis tenax and Eristalis cerealis, and one species of Hymenoptera, Ceratina japonica, indicating that mix planting with <b>male</b> <b>vines</b> and reservation of such insects are recommended. Once pollen grains have pollinated onto the stigma, most of them grow a pollen tube to penetrate into ovule tissue and finally reach the embryo sac to complete ovule fertilization. There are several types of coignetiae vines in Hiruzen vineyards that have different genetic backgrounds. RAPD analysis of 15 vines revealed that they can be divided into three groups and two individuals. Coignetiae vines have been found to have a lower tolerance for water logging than other cultivars, whereas they have moderate drought tolerance. Furthermore, coignetiae vines are not very disease tolerant, especially toward downy mildew, indicating that growers must take sufficient care over drainage and fungus control. V. coignetiae vines accumulate high levels of sugar and acid into the flesh and anthocyanins in the berry skin when they reach the full ripe stage, which is mid and late October in Hiruzen. Tartaric acid, the main acid constituent in coignetiae berries, is contained at levels as high as 1. 0 %. Amino acid concentration in the juice is much lower in most coignetiae vines than other wine grapes, although a special coignetiae vine with berries with high amino acid content has been found. V. coignetiae berries have been proved to have several functional properties such as high free radical scavenging activity and anti-photodecomposition of anthocyanin pigments. As commercial products of coignetiae berries, beautiful wines, pure juice, and wine vinegar with a rich and fruity taste are produced. 岡山県真庭市蒜山で，地域特産物として 1980 年代から栽培が始められたヤマブドウ（Vitis coignetiae Pulliat）について， 1993 年から現在で，系統の識別，結実と果実発育の特性，果実成分の分析を行った．その結果，雌雄異株であるヤマブドウの結実安定のためには，受粉昆虫の活動が必要で，有用な数種の訪花昆虫が同定された．ヤマブドウの雌ずいは形態的に発育がよく，確実に受粉されれば，結実安定は達成される．しかし，ヤマブドウ樹は乾燥には強いが，耐湿性は低く，また，ベト病抵抗性も高くないので，ブドウ園の立地条件が重要である．成熟果実には糖，酸が高濃度で含まれるが，アミノ酸濃度は低い．しかし，探索の結果，一般の赤ワイン用品種 と同程度のアミノ酸含量を持つ樹が発見された．また，ヤマブドウ果実には高濃度の色素が含まれるが，同時にこの色素の光分解を抑制する成分が含まれていることが明らかになった．今後，この成分の同定と食品添加物としての利用が期待される．蒜山地区内のひるぜんワイン㈲ではヤマブドウワイン製造の技術改善が続けられ，赤およびロゼワインとして高い評価を得るようになった．また，「おかやまバイオアクティブ」の開発プロジェクトとしてワインビネガーの試作も行われた．現在，発ガン抑制などの機能性研究も進められており，健康食品としての生産拡大が期待される...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial canker of kiwifruit, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) biovar 3, was first {{recorded}} in New Zealand in November 2010 and quickly made {{production of the}} goldfleshed kiwifruit cultivar, ‘Hort 16 A’, which is highly susceptible to Psa, no longer viable in the Bay of Plenty region. Production of the green-fleshed cultivar, ‘Hayward’ has remained viable but there is uncertainty around its long-term productivity. This thesis investigated aspects of Psa in commercial ‘Hayward’ orchards using observational studies. The aims were to: 1) quantify a change in productivity associated with disease; 2) determine the prevalence of disease in orchards; 3) identify factors that altered the initial development of disease and 4) identify factors that impact {{on the presence of}} severe disease. Severe disease was defined as 5 % or more female vines in a block showing the systemic symptoms of green shoot wilt and cane dieback. To determine Psa effects on productivity historical data from 2599 ‘Hayward’ orchards were analysed. No reduction in productivity was found until 1 year after initial detection of Psa, after controlling for other orchard inputs that affect productivity. A crosssectional survey was sent to all Psa confirmed ‘Hayward’ orchards and 430 growers provided information about one of their ‘Hayward’ orchard blocks. The survey found 84 % of orchard blocks were affected by disease and 57 % had green shoot-wilt and/or cane dieback reported. Blocks typically had a low within block prevalence of systemic symptoms (Median = 5 % of vines). In 194 orchards that were asymptomatic {{at the start of the}} study period the probability of disease developing in a block increased in association with use of Psa protectant sprays immediately post-pruning and using artificial pollination. A lower probability of disease developing was associated with undertaking summer girdling and with the presence of older <b>male</b> <b>vines.</b> The probability of developing severe disease was investigated in 331 orchard blocks that were symptomatic. The probability increased with time after Psa was first detected in a block and was highest when frost damage occurred, when poplar, cypress or pine shelter belts were present and when artificial pollination was used. The probability of severe bacterial canker was lower when spring girdling of female vines was undertaken. The results of this study can be used to prioritise future research. The thesis has also demonstrated the utility of observational studies for plant disease research...|$|R

40|$|The wild grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. subsp. sylvestris (Gmelin) Hegi, {{is a very}} ancient plant. For this reason, its {{presence}} in a determined area is symbol of a millennial tradition of culture of grapevine. Here is why in the actual conception of the wine as expression of a territory, the autochthonous or "local" vines constitute an element of strong identity. They are the custodians and the vehicle of a local authentic cultural property so {{it is very important}} safeguard of the autochthonous vines and their biodiversity. The preservation of wild populations of V. vinifera L. subsp. sylvestris is essential for the maintenance of genetic variability and to resist at the genetic erosion. The intensive cultivation of the grapevine in extensive areas using only a few varieties and clones, has drastically decreased genetic variability and has increased the risk of an epidemic disease. The future of Vitis vinifera L. subsp. sylvestris represents a major stake in biodiversity conservation. Italy, among the other European wine countries, {{is one of the most}} rich of diversification in cultivar varieties and this is a strong advantage for the typical production of both grapevine and wine. Moreover, some area in our country, such as Sardinia and Tuscany, are very rich of local wild vines. This last represents an exaltation of biodiversity, not only as a biological difference, but also as a cultural product of the population’s history. Aware about the scientific importance of these plants, this work was initiated for the safeguard and the ampelographyc, molecular, pathological and phenological study of wild vines. More than one hundred and forty accessions of Vitis vinifera L. subsp. sylvestris were recovered, on several sites of the Tuscany “Maremma” and classified, of which 76 were planted in a collection vineyard and trained to a special trellis system (Totem) to be observed in the same environmental conditions. Female plants having mainly berries of black colour were prevalent respect to <b>male</b> <b>vines.</b> The characterization consisted on: polymorphism of microsatellites loci (SSR); ampelographyc (OIV, 2009) and ampelometric (by computer assisted method “Superampelo”) assessment; pathological monitoring (9 virus tested: GFLV, ArMV, GLRaV- 1,- 2,- 3,- 7, GVA, GVB, GFkV, and fungal infection incidence of Plasmopara viticola); thermal requirement for bud breaking (in growth chamber and phenological study in situ); monitoring of technological grape ripening; micro-vinification and chemical analysis of the wines obtained; secondary metabolites, polyphenols richness and anthocyanins profiles. Data were subjected to multifactorial analysis with standardization where necessary. The nuclear microsatellite profiles showed a wide diversity between the accession tested regardless to the area of origin. Moreover certain supposed accessions of Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris retrieved seem to derive from the vines already cultivated that become wild, while others accessions would be intra-specific cross-breeding sativa-sylvestris. Only 6 accessions showed mainly single virus infections, or in association. Slight differences on fungal infections susceptibility were also found between the accessions tested, while several of them were less susceptible than cv. Sangiovese. Ampelographyc traits of shoot, leaf, grape and berry and ampelometric observations allowed to distinguish the different accessions, which showed a good similarity within the same area of origin. The material retrieved, other than to have a large morphological and genetic variability, evidenced very particular anthocyanins profiles which were different from the most common grape variety cultivated in Tuscany. In addition, the accessions studied had small clusters and berries with a satisfying ripening state and a rich polyphenol content. Also the wines obtained by micro-vinification of several biotypes, subjected to chemical analysis had evidenced differences suggesting possibility of enhance. Several accessions of V. v. sylvestris are able to ripe grapes of acceptable quality, with a reduced use of pesticides. In some cases giving a wine fairly acceptable that can be improved (if not used directly) or it could help to identify varieties with different levels of diseases’s susceptibility. Lastly, the study of the main characteristics could be useful to find out some favourable traits to make a further genetic improvement of our varieties...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{integrated}} seed sector development (ISSD) for sweetpotato was tested in Shinyanga and Meatu districts of the Lake Zone of Tanzania. Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) –Ukiriguru documented the informal system. It comprised <b>male</b> and female <b>vine</b> multipliers with land close to water sources growing sweetpotato {{during the dry}} season. They sold vines during the rainy season, with male multipliers and those with larger crops selling more. The average multiplier supplied approximately 50 farmers who commonly travelled 20 km, each buying approximately 1 – 2 bundles of vine and provided an entry point for disseminating technologies. ARI–Ukiriguru organized demonstrations of rapid multiplication, inorganic and organic fertilizers and new cultivars on multipliers’ land. Fertilizer could economically more than double vine yields with huge potential benefits for an area where production is constrained by planting material; some multipliers immediately began using it. Multipliers took rapid multiplication and new cultivars to their home gardens for further experimentation, seeming likely to adopt especially the cultivar NASPOT 1. A strategy of growing large quantities of irrigated sweetpotato in Misungwi and selling the vines long-distance in Shinyanga, a marketing strategy derived from Uganda, was also adopted.

40|$|Conventional {{agriculture}} is facing many challenges to provide food security for a constantly growing human population. Unfortunately, it still {{relies heavily on}} fossil fuel-derived inputs, such as pesticides, which affect human health, biodiversity and contribute to global warming. In New Zealand, the endemic grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Melolonthinae) has been a pasture pest for more than 100 years. By consuming plant roots, its larvae reduce pasture yield, affecting both dairy and meat production. Recently, adults of this species have been found feeding on horticultural crops, such as kiwifruit, avocado, and vines, amongst others. In vineyards, adults damage vines by feeding on leaves, shoots and inflorescences and can produce a substantial defoliation, reaching in some cases 100 %. For this reason, prophylactic use of synthetic pyrethroids is practised as the main approach to control this pest. Pyrethroids are broad-spectrum insecticides, having clear impacts on arthropod diversity, but also their continuous application can have detrimental effects on human health and, like all such chemicals, can lead to pesticide resistance. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work was to understand C. zealandica adult behaviour as it approaches and feeds on vine foliage and thus evaluate a sustainable approach to reduce its damage in vineyards without using pesticides. For this reason, a range of experiments were carried out on vineyards in Marlborough area of New Zealand, in the Awatere Valley (41 ° 44 ’S; 173 ° 52 ’E) during 2014 and 2015, and in Blenheim (41 ° 33 ’S; 173 ° 55 ’E) during 2015. By studying beetles’ distribution, through adult and larval sampling within vineyard blocks, higher adult and larval numbers were found {{at the edge of the}} vineyard compared to its centre. This distributional pattern was probably an expression of a relict adult behaviour in this species, in which females respond to plant silhouettes against the sky to feed and mate. Is therefore likely that in Marlborough vineyard-dominated landscapes, vines were the most abundant plant silhouettes, which might explain adult and larval abundance at the margin of studied vineyard blocks. In another experiment, by removing adults that landed on the vine foliage at several times after their daily flight activity started, it was demonstrated that females land before <b>males</b> on the <b>vine</b> foliage. Literature suggests that C. zealandica females attract males by releasing their pheromone, phenol. Based on those results, different experiments to evaluate the contribution of feeding and landing deterrents to reducing beetle damage were established at the studied vineyards. A novel, naturally-based approach to reduce adult damage in Marlborough vineyards by applying silica-derived feeding deterrents, such as hydrophobic particle films (HPF) and diatomaceous earths (DE) on the vine foliage and secondly, by placing crushed mussel shells (MS) (Perna canaliculus; Mollusca: Mytilidae) under the vine-row as mulch was investigated in this work. A significant reduction in vine damage was produced by HPF and DE compared to control, with a 46 % damage reduction in Pinot Noir variety. MS significantly reduced the number of adults that landed on the vine plants when compared to control in Pinot Noir. To explore potential synergies between HPF and MS, these were combined in another experiment during the 2015 adult flight season at Blenheim. Adult C. zealandica damage was significantly reduced by 33 and 73 % by HPF and MS, respectively. Using infra-red sensitive video cameras it was demonstrated that MS significantly reduced activity of flying adults above treated vine plants (cv. Pinot Noir), which led to a 28 % increase in grape yield. It was suggested that the light reflective properties of MS reduced the necessary plant contrast with the sky, altering adult landing dynamics and subsequently, vine damage. These findings contribute to the reduction of pesticide use within this agro-ecosystem, and also remove the need for disposal of large quantities of these shells, which would otherwise go to the local landfill. There, the proteinaceous parts of the shell waste generate methane, a key contributor to greenhouse gases due to the anaerobic conditions present in the landfill. In addition, this management is in agreement with the cultural perception of kaitiakitanga, which is the spiritual consideration of protecting the land for descendants, rooted in Maori (New Zealand’s indigenous people) cultural heritage. In this work, a sustainable pest management strategy to reduce C. zealandica damage in vineyards was proposed, highlighting the importance of understanding insect behaviour to reduce pesticide applications and thus, promote environmentally-sound agricultural systems...|$|R
