40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the system of}} evaluation of education currently in force in Poland. In order to standardize {{the quality of education}} in all the courses and in all of the higher education institutions the State Accreditation Committee was founded in the present form in 2002. There were prepared criteria that include the issues associated to assuring the adequate conditions of studying as far as the didactic base is concerned, teaching staff, didactic programmes (included the fulfilling the basic programme minimum), organization of the didactic process, etc. The Maritime University of Gdynia educates and trains the specialist for working at sea. Thus far, the didactic system must meet the requirements not only of the SAC (typical for a technical university) but also of the STCW convention that imposes adequate requirements as far as the subjects, number of hours, periods and subjects of practical training, etc. is concerned. For the graduates that will work at sea, the problems of meeting criteria of education were presented taking Faculty of Marine Engineering of the Maritime University of Gdynia as an example the, which prepares students in the course of Mechanics and Machine Building and prepares graduates for the work at sea as mechanic officer of merchant marine. The paper presents Medium Speed Engine Room Full Mission Simulator.

40|$|The {{hardware}} {{structure of}} an integrated systems control (ISC) must support the functions which are {{carried out by the}} ISC. This idea seems to be very simple at first sight though it has many aspects and difficulties. It is quite possible to formulate several general objectives for the ISC hardware. They are the following: (1) to implement all functions which make up the ISC; (2) to be constructed in a hierarchical structure; (3) to ensure effective data input, output, processing and storage; and (4) to take into consideration the possibilities of development and improvement. Hardware problems will be discussed with these remarks in mind. The first question to be discussed is what kind of general hardware structure should be used? In this case we must consider two different alternatives: (1) use of one or more large-capacity computers to solve the tasks for all the control levels; and (2) use of a number of mini- or <b>medium-sized</b> <b>computers</b> at individual levels. We consider an "ideal" hardware structure in terms of these alternatives and certainly we accept the terms "ideal" rather conditionally...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{computers}} {{can be used}} to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for <b>medium-sized</b> quantum <b>computers.</b> Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH 2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.

40|$|For {{the first}} time in {{computing}} history, in the 1990 s we were able to establish a well balanced pyramid ranging from local-area and wide-area broadband networks, via the diversity of workstation and PC platforms in client-server structures supporting cooperative and even realtime computing, up to the layer of <b>medium-sized</b> innovative <b>computer</b> architectures capable to spread computational science and engineering as a key technology over science and industry and also to support methodologically and capacity-wise, finally, the apex of the pyramid, the infrastructure of top-level supercomputers with the mission of an often nation-wide resource. However, already H. H. Goldstine said: "The history of computers is littered with australopithecanes, the deviant apes that anthropologists keep finding: little evolutionary lines that don't lead anywhere", which is especially true for HPC. Also nowadays, long-range planning for supercomputer centres is a tough task which suffers from sudden deaths of innovative product lines and dead-ends in hailed, but finally meager supercomputer roadmaps. Simultaneously, false promises of cheap solutions may seduce funding agencies to stop enhancing supercomputing despite increasing needs of simulations. However, the time span when the performance level of today's Top 500 supercomputers will be reached by the as well exponentially growing PC and workstation performance, amounts up to 14 years. This gap offers opportunities for innovative software product development even for countries where native hardware manufacturers are no longer existent who could act as focal points of national software achievements. Definitely, at least in Germany, missing (super) computer hardware industry demands supercomputer centres {{to play the role of}} crystallization kernels an...|$|R
40|$|Computer-aided {{design is}} the generic {{term for a}} rapidly proliferating set of {{techniques}} which have become mandatory for all who wish to maintain their competitive positions in {{an increasing number of}} industries. CAD practitioners in advanced technology industries such as aerospace and electronics are usually highly sophisticated in computer usage and therefore able to configure their own CAD environments to suit their requirements. Those, however, who are relatively new to computers, are faced with a bewildering set of choices over which they have to make decisions. Should they have a cheap terminal linked to a remote time-sharing bureau? Should they attempt to do their whole design job on a dedicated, <b>medium-sized</b> in-house <b>computer?</b> Or should they invest in a high capability, intelligent terminal backed up by access to a central (or network-distributed) number-crunching and data-bank facility? What graphic facilities should they use? A drum plotter, a storage-tube display, interactive refresh graphics unit, hardware rotation, conic generation, zooming, are all choices that are presented to them and the manufacturers' praise of their own line is often more confusing than helpful. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA, has recently embarked on a World Survey of CAD, one of whose aims has been to provide guidance to would-be users on the establishment of CAD facilities suited to their needs. In this work IIASA has relied heavily on the analysis of the activity phases in CAD, currently being conducted by W. G. 5. 2 (Computer-Aided Design) of IFIP (The International Federation for Information Processing) ...|$|R
