40|$|International audienceThis work aims {{to study}} the {{chemical}} composition and the antifungal activity of Lavandula multifida essential oil against three fungal decays of apples in post-harvest according to two methods: direct contact in agar médium and <b>micro-atmosphère.</b> This species has provided an essential oil with a yield of 2. 4 %. The chromatographic analysis (GC and GC/MS) of this essential oil has identified 28 constituents, accounting more than 90 % in total oil, which caravacrol (57. 9 %) was the most principal component. The results obtained showed that the essential oil has a significant inhibition of the mycelial growth of all strains (p< 0. 05). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this oil is 0. 125 μL/mL of air against the three strains tested when using microatmosphere method. In contrast, MICs are 0. 125 μL/ mL for Alternaria sp., and 0. 25 μL/mL for Penicillium expansum and Rhizopus stlonifer when using the direct contact method. This antifungal activity is due mainly to the richness of this essential oil in carvacrol known for its effectiveness against the microbial agents...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{antibacterial}} activity of 32 Essential Oils (EOs) was assessed against four pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium) and one spoilage bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Agar diffusion, <b>micro-atmosphere</b> and microbroth assays {{were used to}} evaluate the {{antibacterial activity}} in solid, vapour and liquid phase, respectively. In solid phase, Red thyme, Red bergamot, Ajowan, Summer savory, Chinese cinnamon, and Cinnamon bark had higher inhibitory zone (20 – 40 mm) against five target bacteria as compared with other EOs. Red thyme, Red bergamot, Ajowan, Summer savory inhibited S. aureus by more than 60 mm. In vapour phase, at 30 μl of tested EOs, Chinese cinnamon and Red bergamot were the only EOs that inhibited all target bacteria with the inhibition zone from 20 to more than 60 mm depending on target bacteria. In liquid phase, Chinese cinnamon showed the best antibacterial activity among all EOs and it inhibited S. aureus and E. coli at low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 470 ppm. In checkerboard method, combined Chinese cinnamon and Cinnamon bark EOs showed additive antibacterial effects against all bacteria. Sensory evaluation of combined Chinese cinnamon and Cinnamon bark EOs used in cooked meat was conducted and an EO level of 0. 05 % was the highest organoleptically acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Annually around 4 million {{foodborne}} illnesses {{occur in}} Canada {{resulting in an}} economic burden of approximately 3. 7 billion. In recent years, several microbiological issues in food safety have emerged. Subsequently, novel techniques and antimicrobial formulations are required to maintain microbiologically safe foods while preserving their natural taste. Essential oils {{are one of the}} best naturally-known candidates to be used as food preservatives due to their inherent antimicrobial properties and Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) status. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of 32 EOs was evaluated in vitro against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using 3 different methods (agar diffusion assay, <b>micro-atmosphere</b> assay and broth microdilution assay). Based on the results stemming from the different methods employed in this study, some EOs such as Red thyme, Red bergamot, Winter savory, Chinese cinnamon and Cinnamon bark were found to be more effective than the others as they showed higher antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. In addition, the combination effect of selected EOs was tested based on the checkerboard method. The results showed that the combination of Chinese cinnamon and Cinnamon bark EOs exhibited an additive effect against all the tested bacteria. This combination was selected to perform sensorial analyses which showed that 0. 05...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the acidity {{of ocean}} waters will {{directly}} threaten calcifying marine organisms such as reef-building scleractinian corals, and {{the myriad of}} species that rely on corals for protection and sustenance. Ocean pH has already decreased by around 0. 1 pH units {{since the beginning of}} the industrial revolution, and is expected to decrease by another 0. 2 – 0. 4 pH units by 2100. This study mimicked the pre-industrial, present, and near-future levels of p CO 2 using a precise control system (± 5 % p CO 2), to assess the impact of ocean acidification on the calcification of recently-settled primary polyps of Acropora digitifera, both with and without symbionts, and adult fragments with symbionts. The increase in p CO 2 of 100 μatm between the pre-industrial period and the present had more effect on the calcification rate of adult A. digitifera than the anticipated future increases of several hundreds of <b>micro-atmospheres</b> of p CO 2. The primary polyps with symbionts showed higher calcification rates than primary polyps without symbionts, suggesting that (i) primary polyps housing symbionts are more tolerant to near-future ocean acidification than organisms without symbionts, and (ii) corals acquiring symbionts from the environment (i. e. broadcasting species) will be more vulnerable to ocean acidification than corals that maternally acquire symbionts...|$|R
40|$|The CO{sub 2 } {{system in}} {{seawater}} {{is characterized by}} four measurable parameters: TA, the total alkalinity; TC, the total (inorganic) CO{sub 2 } (the sum of the dissolved CO{sub 2 }, the carbonate, and the bicarbonate); pH; and either fCO{sub 2 }, the fugacity of CO{sub 2 }, or xCO{sub 2 }, the mole fraction of CO{sub 2 } in air. Ta and TC are independent of temperature; fCO{sub 2 }, xCO{sub 2 }, and pH are not. The knowledge of any two of these parameters, along with the temperature, the salinity, the abundances of other constituents of seawater, and the relevant equilibrium constants, allows {{the determination of the}} other two. There are four programs in this package: CO 2 SYSTM. EXE; FCO 2 TCO 2. EXE; PHTCO 2. EXE; CO 2 BTCH. EXE. They are designed to be run on any 80 x 86 computer equipped with the DOS operating system. They are run simply by typing the program name from the command line. All input data for these programs should be in micromoles per kilogram of solution ({micro}mol/kg-soln), <b>micro-atmospheres</b> ({micro}atm) in the case of fCO{sub 2 }, and parts per million (ppm) in the case of xCO{sub 2 }. The pH should be on the total scale. All outputs are in these units also. Each program in this package allows a choice from the four sets of constants K{sub 1 } and K{sub 2 }: those of Roy et al., Goyet and Poisson, Hansson and Mehrbach et al...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{preservatives}} as well as active packaging has sparked interest in the food industry. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial characteristics of the essential oil of pink pepper (PPEO) and {{to use it as}} an active component in the elaboration of films for application in the development of bioconservant packaging for food. Through the chromatographic analysis (GC/MS) 18 compounds, 4 monoterpenes and 14 sesquiterpenes were detected, of which β- myrcene (41 %), β-cuvebene (12 %) and Limonene (9 %) were the majority. In the antimicrobial activity of PPEO in agar and broth, action was observed against five pathogenic bacteria. The MIC for S. aureus and L. monocytogenes was 0. 68 and 1. 36 mg/mL, and the MBC was 2. 72 mg/mL for both. In <b>micro-atmosphere</b> the reduction was 100 % in the development of S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, and 16 and 15 % for E. coli and S. Typhimurium. The contact time required for MBC to act on Gram positive bacteria was lower than the 12 h period, and Gram negative bacteria were not inhibited. In addition, changes in the permeability and integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane of all evaluated bacteria were observed, indicating that damage in the cellular envelope is one of its mechanisms of action. PPEO was applied as an active component in cellulose acetate films evaluated in vitro (agar, broth and <b>micro-atmosphere)</b> and in situ (sliced mozzarella cheese) against pathogenic bacteria. It was found that concentrations of 2, 4 and 6 % PPEO in the polymer matrix conferred activity on all média evaluated against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Escherichia coli was sensitive in liquid medium and in microatmosphere, while S. Typhimurium showed no sensitivity to antibacterial films. In situ inhibition has demonstrated that the affinity between the OEPR apolar molecules and the lipid components of the cheese allows migration of the OE from the interior of the polymer to the surface and facilitates its dispersion in the food, indicating its favorable application as an active packaging. Keywords: Essential oil; Antibacterial activity;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPESA utilização de conservantes naturais bem como de embalagens ativas vêm ganhando espaço na indústria de alimentos. Neste trabalho, objetivou-se avaliar as características antimicrobianas do óleo essencial de pimenta rosa (OEPR) e, utilizá- lo como componente ativo na elaboração de filmes para aplicação no desenvolvimento de embalagens bioconservantes para alimentos. Através da análise cromatográfica (CG/MS), detectou-se 18 compostos, 4 monoterpenos e 14 sesquiterpenos, dos quais β-mirceno (41 %), β-cuvebeno (12 %) e Limoneno (9 %) foram os majoritários. Na atividade antimicrobiana do OEPR em ágar e caldo, verificou-se ação contra cinco bactérias patogênicas. A CIM (Concentração Inibitória Mínima) para S. aureus e L. monocytogenes foi de 0, 68 e 1, 36 mg/mL, respectivamente e a CBM (Concentração Bactericida Mínima) foi de 2, 72 mg/mL, para ambas. Em micro-atmosfera a redução foi de 100 % no desenvolvimento de S. aureus e L. monocytogenes e, 16 e 15 % para E. coli e S. Typhimurium. O tempo de contato necessário para a CBM agir sobre bactérias Gram positivas foi inferior ao período de 12 h, e bactérias Gram negativas não foram inibidas. Além disso, foram verificadas alterações na permeabilidade e integridade da membrana citoplasmática de todas as bactérias avaliadas, indicando que o dano no envoltório celular é um dos seus mecanismos de ação. O OEPR foi aplicado como componente ativo em filmes de acetato de celulose, avaliados in vitro (ágar, caldo e micro-atmosfera) e in situ (queijo mozarela fatiado) contra bactérias patogênicas. Foi verificado que concentrações de 2, 4 e 6 % de OEPR na matriz polimérica, conferiu atividade em todos os meios avaliados contra L. monocytogenes e S. aureus. Escherichia coli foi sensível em meio liquido e em micro-atmosfera, enquanto S. Typhimurium não demonstrou sensibilidade aos filmes antibacterianos. A inibição in situ, demonstrou que a afinidade entre as moléculas apolares do OEPR e os componentes lipídicos do queijo permite a migração do OE do interior do polímero para a superfície facilitando sua dispersão no alimento, indicando favorável sua aplicação como embalagem ativa...|$|E
