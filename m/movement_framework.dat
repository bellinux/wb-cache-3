40|$|In this demo proposal, we {{describe}} REEF, {{a framework that}} {{makes it easy to}} implement scalable, fault-tolerant runtime environments for a range of computational models. We will demonstrate diverse workloads, including extract-transform-load MapReduce jobs, iterative machine learning algorithms, and ad-hoc declarative query processing. At its core, REEF builds atop YARN (Apache Hadoop 2 ’s resource manager) to provide retainable hardware resources with lifetimes that are decoupled from those of computational tasks. This allows us to build persistent (cross-job) caches and clusterwide services, but, more importantly, supports high-performance iterative graph processing and machine learning algorithms. Unlike existing systems, REEF aims for composability of jobs across computational models, providing significant performance and usability gains, even with legacy code. REEF includes a library of interoperable data management primitives optimized for communication and data movement (which are distinct from storage locality). The library also allows REEF applications to access external services, such as user-facing relational databases. We were careful to decouple lower levels of REEF from the data models and semantics of systems built atop it. The result was two new standalone systems: Tang, a configuration manager and dependency injector, and Wake, a state-of-the-art event-driven programming and data <b>movement</b> <b>framework.</b> Both are language independent, allowing REEF to bridge the JVM and.

40|$|Communities in {{developing}} country mountain areas, {{in part due}} to their remoteness, find themselves excluded from social, political and economic systems; and excluded from access to resources. This paper aims to study the impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on remoteness and exclusion. It utilises two models — the resource <b>movement</b> <b>framework,</b> and the “information chain” — to analyse a telecentre in one district of mountainous Huancavelica, Peru’s poorest region, set in the high Andes. It finds ICTs enabling new and positive resource flows for the two key user groups: teenaged school students and young farmers. These help to maintain social networks. They also support information searches that have improved agricultural practice where other information chain resources have been available. But non-use and ineffective use of the telecentre are found where information chain resources are lacking. ICTs have some impacts on intangible elements of remoteness. In this particular example, they also offer access to some previously-excluded resources. But they have not really addressed the systematic exclusions faced by mountain communities. And they so far appear to be a technology of inequality; favouring those residents who begin with better resource endowments. The paper concludes by offering some recommendations for mountain ICT project practice.

40|$|This {{research}} {{identified and}} analysed {{a number of}} inland port sites in the five counties surrounding Los Angeles, using a location-allocation methodology. It also considered the inland ports' potential for integration into a more efficient regional intermodal goods movement system served by the southern California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. GIS was used to map the sites where international cargo is processed in the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. One hundred transportation zones were determined from a truck travel {{survey conducted by the}} ports. These zones represent density points for distribution/processing centres. First, a single facility location model was used to define the proximal location of an inland port that minimises the total truck-miles travelled. Then, we extended this model to a series of location-allocation models with up to six inland port locations included. With no inland port (current system), the total daily vehicle-miles travelled (VMT) is 220, 100 miles, and the average trip length is 11. 6 miles. As more inland ports are added to the location-allocation model, the total truck-miles travelled is reduced significantly. The new system follows the concept of a ‘satellite inland port’, which is based on a hub-and-spoke configuration. Also, with significant reductions in VMT, a proportional amount of congestion relief and air pollution reduction is expected from this new goods <b>movement</b> <b>framework.</b> The results show that the mathematical approach is a useful platform for initial investigations into inland port site selection.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{movement}} in high-performance computing systems accelerated by graphics processing units (GPUs) remains a challenging problem. Data communication in popular parallel programming models, {{such as the}} Message Passing Interface (MPI), is currently limited to the data stored in the CPU memory space. Auxiliary memory systems, such as GPU memory, are not integrated into such data <b>movement</b> <b>frameworks,</b> thus providing applications with no direct mechanism to perform end-to-end data movement. We introduce MPI-ACC, an integrated and extensible framework that allows end-to-end data {{movement in}} accelerator-based systems. MPI-ACC provides productivity and performance benefits by integrating support for auxiliary memory spaces into MPI. MPI-ACC’s runtime system enables several key optimizations, including pipelining of data transfers and balancing of communication based on accelerator and node architecture. We demonstrate the extensible design of MPI-ACC by using the popular CUDA and OpenCL accelerator programming interfaces. We {{examine the impact of}} MPI-ACC on communication performance and evaluate application-level benefits on a large-scale epidemiology simulation. Keywords-MPI; GPU; CUDA; OpenCL; MPI-ACC I...|$|R

40|$|Turkey has {{undergone}} large-scale transformations {{over the past}} 30 years, changing it from a Kemalist Republic to a country ruled by a moderately Islamic party – the Justice and Development Party (AKP). I study how Islamic business associations (BAs) have gained political influence over dominant secular BAs in Turkey – a key process of these transformations. Existing literature treats voluntary BAs either as purely economic institutions, or focuses on political elites’ strategic policy and power interests in explaining BAs’ political influence. There is inadequate guidance on when BAs turn into political actors, and how they engage in mobilisation and broader intra-state power struggles. Especially the role of ideology and religion has been neglected, which is relevant for several transition countries’ business politics. This inadequacy can be addressed by developing a social <b>movement</b> <b>framework.</b> Following a grounded theory approach, I conducted a comparative analysis of secular and Islamic BAs’ networks structures (1993 – 2012), collective action frames, organisational structures and patterns of resource-exchange across changing institutional contexts. Findings are based on 51 semi-structured interviews in Gaziantep’s textile cluster in Turkey and additional archival material. I argue that Islamic BAs gained political influence because they applied typical social movement tactics that are adapted to the cultural and political environment. Conditions of politico-religious contention combined with gradual economic liberalisation have encouraged marginalised businesspeople to apply Islam in a non-contentious and market-based way. By integrating with civil society at the grassroots level, and gaining the support of political elites, Islamic BAs have complemented economic activities with resonant framing. These tactics grounded in Islam have increased Islamic BAs political influence by creating a new pious and legitimate business elite. These findings contribute to the literature by extending the types of institutional incentives, tactics and actors that businesspeople rely on to engage in contentious politics to include ideological factors...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{theories}} have been advanced {{in the effort}} to explain how a given policy issue manages to take root in the public sphere and subsequently move forward on the public legislative agenda—or not. This study examined how the social determinants of health (SDOH) came {{to be part of the}} legislative policy agenda in Britain from 1980 to 2003. ^ The specific objectives of the research were: (1) to conduct a sociopolitical analysis grounded in alternative agenda-setting theories to identify the factors responsible for moving the social determinants health perspective onto the British policy agenda; and (2) to determine which of the theories and related dimensions best accounted for the emergence of this perspective. ^ A triangulated content and context analysis of British news articles, historical accounts, and research commentaries of the SDOH movement was conducted guided by relevant agenda-setting theories set within a social <b>movement</b> <b>framework</b> to chronicle the emergence of the SDOH as a significant policy issue in Britain. ^ The most influential social movement and agenda setting elements in the emergence of the SDOH in Britain were issue generation tactics, framing efforts, mobilizing structures, and political opportunities grounded in social movement and agenda setting theories. Policy content or the details of the policy had comparatively little impact on the successful emergence of the SDOH. Despite resistance by the government, from 1980 to 1996 interest groups created a political understanding of the SDOH utilizing a framing package encompassing notions of inequality, fairness, and justice. This frame transmitted a powerful idea connected to a core set of British values and beliefs. After 1996, a shift in political opportunities cemented the institutional arrangements needed to sustain an environment conducive to the development and implementation of SDOH policies and programs. ^ This research demonstrates that the U. S. emergence of the SDOH on the policy agenda will depend upon: (1) U. S. ideals and values regarding poverty, inequality, race, health, and health care that will determine issue framing; (2) political opportunities that will emerge—or not—to advance the SDOH policy agenda; and (3) the mobilizing structures that support or oppose the issue. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} education {{within a}} transnational capital <b>movement</b> <b>framework,</b> investigating {{the experiences of}} first-generation educated Bangladeshi immigrant women arriving in Britain between 1999 and 2007. Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of education (1973, 1990 [1977]), his notions of forms of capital (1986), and a feminist perspective on these theories are utilized to explain the interplay of class and gender in educating middle-class Bangladeshi women, {{the economic and social}} value of these academic qualifications in migration, and the gendered dimension of social reproduction in their diaspora. In the discussion of Bangladeshi women in Britain, this thesis for the first time deals with educated women from that background (as opposed to the majority Sylheti community that {{has been the subject of}} much research). Its primary data are in-depth interviews with twenty-eight highly-educated Bangladeshi women across England. In my methodology chapter I discuss, inter alia, the problematic of researching social equals, and the possibilities and limitations of ‘partial knowledge’ within that context. My in-depth analysis of the narratives around the participants’ family, upbringing, education and gender structure establishes the theoretical relevance of Bourdieu’s concept of education as cultural capital in post-colonial, resource-poor Bangladeshi society. In discussing gender and the internationalization of higher education in this context, I revise Bourdieu’s definition of ‘academic capital’, proposing three main categories that operate in my participants’ lives: namely ‘elite’, ‘standard’ and ‘general’ academic capital. This thesis challenges the argument that human movement and capital movement are similar and equal by analysing the differentiated values of academic qualifications and academic capital in the advanced, neoliberal labour market of Britain where the host country’s specific ‘cultural capital’ is at play. Finally, my thesis extends knowledge about immigrant women’s involvement in the developing diasporic ‘middle class’ with an investigation of these educated Bangladeshi women’s social lives and ‘mother work’ in the framework of social reproduction. This thesis develops an original and new dialogue between skilled migration, the Bangladeshi community in Britain, and the dynamic of gender and social class across borders, inviting further debates within and beyond feminist thoughts around educated middle-class women’s migration and its far-reaching consequences in the contemporary transnational world. Key Words: Education, Capital, Bangladeshi Women, Migration, Gender and Britain. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relationships}} between human population movement (HPM) and health are a concern at global level. In {{the case of}} malaria, those links are crucial {{in relation to the}} spread of drug resistant parasites and to the elimination of malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-Region (GMS) and beyond. The mobile and migrant populations (MMP) who are involved in forest related activities are both at high risk of being infected with malaria and at risk of receiving late and sub-standard treatment due to poor access to health services. In Cambodia, in 2012, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) identified, as a key objective, the development of a specific strategy for MMPs in order to address these challenges. A population <b>movement</b> <b>framework</b> (PMF) for malaria was developed and operationalized in order to contribute to this strategy. Methods: A review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted. Based on a synthesis of the results, information was presented and discussed with experienced researchers and programme managers in the Cambodian NMCP and led to the development and refinement of a PMF for malaria. The framework was 'tested' for face and content validity with national experts through a workshop approach. Results: In the literature, HPM has been described using various spatial and temporal dimensions both {{in the context of the}} spread of anti-malarial drug resistance, and in the context of malaria elimination and previous classifications have categorized MMPs in Cambodia and the GMS through using a number of different criteria. Building on these previous models, the PMF was developed and then refined and populated with in-depth information relevant to Cambodia collected from social science research and field experiences in Cambodia. The framework comprises of the PMF itself, MMP activity profiles and a Malaria Risk Index which is a summation of three related indices: a vulnerability index, an exposure index and an access index which allow a qualitative ranking of malaria risk in the MMP population. Application of currently available data to the framework illustrates that the highest risk population are those highly mobile populations engaged in forest work. Conclusion: This paper describes the process of defining MMPs in Cambodia, identifying the different activities and related risks to appropriately target and tailor interventions to the highest risk groups. The framework has been used to develop more targeted behaviour change and outreach interventions for MMPs in Cambodia and its utility and effectiveness will be evaluated as part of those interventions...|$|E
40|$|Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{disabling}} mental disorders, and has a major impact on society. The landmark WHO 2004 Global Burden of Disease report quantified depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide (an estimated 154 million sufferers). Fortunately, depression can be ameliorated through the provision of suitable objective technology for detecting depression. Disturbances in the expression of affect reflect changes in mood and interpersonal style, and are arguably a key index of a current depressive episode. This leads directly to impaired interpersonal functioning, causing a range of interpersonal disabilities, functioning in the workforce, absenteeism and difficulties with a range of everyday tasks (such as shopping). Whilst these are a constant source of distress in affected subjects, the economic impact of mental health disorders through direct and indirect costs has long been underestimated. Despite its severity and high prevalence, there currently exist no laboratory-based objective measures of illness expression, course and recovery. This compromises optimal patient care, compounding the burden of disability. As healthcare costs increase worldwide, the provision of effective health monitoring systems and diagnostic aids is highly important. With the advancement of affective sensing and machine learning, computer aided diagnosis can and will play a major role in providing an objective assessment. The research presented in this thesis addresses some of the key issues of automatic depression analysis mentioned as follows: 1) analysing geometrical and appearance descriptors for depression analysis; 2) the role of upper body movements in detecting depression; 3) fusion of audio and video channels; 4) relative body parts movement analysis for depression detection. The central hypothesis of the thesis is that using different modalities and information from body parts, will lead to more accurate detection of depression. To validate the approaches, clinically approved datasets from the Black Dog Institute, Sydney, and the University of Pittsburgh, USA, are used. First, subject-dependent active appearance model based geometrical descriptors are computed. Subject independent parts based models are applied in parallel to extract texture descriptors. A thorough comparison is made on the Black Dog Institute clinical data. Furthermore, head movements are computed using the fiducial points and a histogram is constructed. Space Time Interest Points are also computed on the upper body to capture subtle gestures, which can provide discriminative information. The speech signal is also analysed and its feature descriptors are combined with visual information extracted from face and upper body, respectively. Various fusion scenarios are studied in this multimodal framework. The contribution of body expressions are further explored by proposing a relative part <b>movement</b> <b>framework</b> and validating it on the University of Pittsburgh data. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work in affective computing community to use body expressions for detecting depression. The results presented in this thesis show that, as hypothesised, the multimodal framework outperforms uni-modal approaches in the task of classifying between depressed patients and healthy controls. Moreover, the body expressions, used as an auxiliary modality, provide significant discriminating information for depression recognition...|$|E
40|$|Transnational {{terrorism}} {{promoted by}} the Al-Qaeda movement gained high-level strategic attention after 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York, Shanksville, and Arlington in the United States of America that killed at least 3000 people. Attacks by Al-Qaeda inspired groups also occurred in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, and East Africa. Al-Qaeda which means the ‘base’ or foundation in Arabic was established by Abdullah Yusuf Azam, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and {{a small group of}} mujahideen volunteers who fought in Afghanistan against Soviet occupation during the 1980 s. Under their leadership the movement expanded its ideology by establishing regional franchises with insurgent groups. The shifting pattern of its activism is highlighted through selected cases of transnational jihadist terrorist Sunni groups in the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa that developed formal links to its senior leaders and facilitated ideological decentralisation whilst drawing from the Salafist model. Many groups used its brand name to conduct terrorist attacks on its behalf. To gain further knowledge and understanding of the scale and security implications of the Al-Qaeda movement’s ideology, comparative analysis has drawn from early forms of religious and secular terrorism to highlight the salience of religious, socio-political, and economic grievances that have formed the basis of insurgencies. Based on grievances, Al-Qaeda’s transnational focus has projected unlimited objectives and differed from domestically focused groups whose campaigns declined or were ended. The Al-Qaeda movement influenced the nature of domestic terrorism by hijacking and redefining its ideological space and narrative and turning it into a global conflict and holy war. This political model was picked up by its more potent and zealous informal affiliate the Islamic State group (IS), successor to Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) that sought to establish an Islamic caliphate in Sunni dominated provinces of north western Iraq and eastern Syria. Under the leadership of Abu Bakr Baghdadi the Islamic State group rapidly evolved from near obscurity into a global jihadist insurgent network despite facing heavy criticism from terrorist groups and Muslim communities because of its overly violent image. The Islamic State group’s excessive violence became an extension of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, at the time of growing opposition towards the presence of US-led coalition forces in mid- 2003 to 2006. The group’s hardline behaviour surpassed that Jabhat al-Nusra (JN), Al-Qaeda’s informal affiliate that also operated in Syria in 2012. The strategic move by the group to change its name on 29 June 2014 from the Islamic State in Iraq and greater Syria (ISIS) to ‘Islamic State’ group (IS) reflected its transnational ambitions of establishing a caliphate, a move which by 2015 posed greater challenges when compared to earlier affiliates of the Al-Qaeda movement. Al-Qaeda <b>movement</b> <b>framework</b> has posed new challenges for counter-terrorism strategists who had to continually modify policy approaches to deal with its emergent activities. In terms of ideological appeal, the Al-Qaeda brand name may not disappear from the political scene as its religious discourse is likely to inspire new generations of activists. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{existence}} and scale of formal memberships {{in a country}} or a region have often been used {{as an indicator of}} the country’s degree of civility or the civic and voluntary engagement in the population (Almond and Verba 1963; Curtis, Grabb and Baer 1992; Curtis Baer and Grabb 2001; Putnam 2000). At the same time, many of the larger nonprofit organisations that exist today, and attract scholarly as well as political interest on national as well as international level, are often organised as federative, membership-based organizations. Despite this interest in memberships on a macro level, the organisational level is often left out of the analysis, thus ignoring the primary context in which these memberships are defined and develop. Furthermore, only a very limited line of research has hitherto recognised the importance of member-based organizations and their federated organizational structures {{in the last couple of}} decades of nonprofit or voluntary sector literature (6 and Kendall 1997; Smith 2000 a; Young 2001). In this paper, we line out and develop an argument where a popular movement tradition dominates the Swedish civil society and its organizations, but it is fairly easy to imagine also other dominant traditions or frameworks in other countries. In France we would, for example, probably find a tradition inspired from or developed out of the social economy paradigm so strong in the French-speaking civil society culture (Archambault 1996). In the Netherlands we would instead probably find a tradition that in some way includes the “three-pillar-system” that stands central in this country (Burger and Dekker 2001), while the charity or voluntary tradition found in Britain (Kendall 2003) and other countries where the Anglo-Saxon influence has been strong, are so dominating that it sometimes is used as a frame even for international civil society comparisons or theoretical work. The main aim of this paper is to line out, describe and analyse one of the most central elements in a wider and dominant civil society framework in Sweden, the membership. In this paper we will argue that a certain group of nonprofit organizations in Sweden, the popular movement organizations (folkrörelserna), have so many organizational attributes in common that they constitute an institutionalized organizational field in the way for example DiMaggio and Powell (1983, p. 148) use the term. The main empirical material used in the paper are in-depth interviews with top-level national leaders in a number of large Swedish federations often understood to be popular movement organizations. In the analysis of the interviews, we focus on the use of two central aspects that often are seen as central for the understanding of the popular movement concept – membership and democracy. These features are repeatedly used and given meaning both by top-level leaders of Swedish voluntary or nonprofit organizations and others. A second purpose of the paper is to point at and discuss the relation between this wider civil society framework and the nonprofit or voluntary organizations found in a particular country. In this paper, Sweden is used as the empirical example and we will report on a specific legal case where the dominant civil society tradition was challenged and defended. We will argue that an important element in the relationship between the wider popular <b>movement</b> <b>framework</b> and the organizations in Swedish civil society in this case can well be understood as one of coercive isomorphism, one of the mechanisms identified by DiMaggio and Powell (1983). As indicated, our paper and research is inspired by a line of institutional theory and research in which organizations and organizational arrangements are found at the core of the analysis and where the work of authors like Meyer and Rowan (1977), DiMaggio and Powell (1983) and Deephouse (1996) stand central. Through the use of a mix of empirical evidence our intention is to explore and make visible what we have chose to term a popular movement marinade. This “marinade” is a metaphor for the organizational cultural context in which not only Swedish nonprofits or voluntary organizations and their members are found, but also for example the legal system around the civil society arena, the construction of various public subsidy structures or the political debate. In the paper, we argue that this strong popular movement tradition or understanding represents something so heavily embedded and well institutionalised in Sweden that it often seems to be taken for granted. The popular movement tradition can be described as a frame so strong that not only civil society social practice but also thinking could be understood as more or less marinated in it (see also Wijkström 2004 a; Wijkström, Einarsson et al. 2004). popular movement; civil society; discourse analysis; membership; federation; Sweden...|$|E

The workflow has three main components: a semi-automated image processing pipeline to track and record insect trajectories, a trajectory visualization tool for qualitative analysis of insect movements and the quantitative trajectory measurements for statistical hypothesis testing. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework in the context-dependent navigational strategies employed by Kenyan seed harvester ants.|$|R

The study used a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative interviews, focus group, and participant observation methods. It found that digital activism {{is on the}} rise, and that social media platforms offer many perceived benefits for activism work, but also create significant obstacles in both the digital and offline realms. As such, this article offers recommendations, based on best practices, to bolster the efficacy of digital activism in Lebanon. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Within a GB [...] like <b>framework</b> <b>movement</b> out of {{an object}} {{seems to be a}} valid concept for the {{description}} of natural languages whereas movement out of subjects and adjuncts is almost impossible. In a framework in which the notion object is determined configurationally, this condition on movement restricts the class of licensed structures. We will argue that this condition restricts as well the class of languages that can be generated. In order to study formal properties we transfer this condition to linear indexed grammars and define two new formalisms: right linear indexed grammars and extended right linear indexed grammar. The classes of languages generated are proper subclasses of the class of linear indexed languages. In fact, we show that right linear indexed grammars are weakly equivalent to context free grammars, despite of the possibility to have in a derivation for each nonterminal an associated index stack (of unbounded depth). 1 Motivation Within a GB [...] like <b>framework</b> <b>movement</b> [...] ...|$|R
