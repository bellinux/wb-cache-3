5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference.</b> The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

He also introduced promising youngsters Bert Sproston, Billy Furness and Eric Stephenson, who went on to play for England. In the 1934–35 season, Leeds adopted a half yellow-half blue strip, in tribute to the defunct Leeds City, and this kit stayed in place until 1948, with several variations on the colours being used between then and 1960–61. The club also adopted their first badge in 1934, using the city crest.|$|E

40|$|Original title: Werk aan de wijk In 2007, {{the then}} Dutch Minister for Housing, Communities and Integration, Ella Vogelaar, {{announced}} the Action Plan for Empowered Neighbourhoods (Actieplan Krachtwijken). The {{aim was to}} bring about a notable improvement in forty disadvantaged neighbourhoods {{over the course of a}} decade in the areas of housing, employment, education and growing up, integration and safety. This report first describes how the socioeconomic position of people living in these ‘priority neighbourhoods’ has changed. Are there opportunities for social advancement? To what extent are these neighbourhoods confronted with selective migration: low-income households moving in and higher-income households moving out? We were most interested in the effectiveness of the Dutch government's 'empowered neighbourhoods policy', aimed at improving the liveability, safety and socioeconomic status of the forty priority neighbourhoods. These aspects were evaluated using a quasi-experimental research design. We tested the effectiveness of individual neighbourhood interventions in the form of restructuring, selling off social rented housing and a package of social measures. Although there has been some improvement in residents’ satisfaction with their neighbourhood, our findings do beg the question of whether the ambitious empowered neighbourhoods policy has <b>made</b> such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> as was assumed. Positive effects on liveability and safety turn out to be more the result of restructuring activities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mobile phones {{have become}} the primary form of {{communication}} in both developed and developing countries. The spread has been fast and mobile phones have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> {{to the lives of}} more people and quicker than any previous technology. The world has crossed the 5 billion in mobile connections mark. At the end of 1990 there were just 11 million mobile subscribers. Mobiles provide a unique way of reaching the masses of people, which have been hard or impossible to reach otherwise, especially in the remote places of the world. Mobile phones are one of the only devices reaching nearly all consumers at the Base of the Pyramid (BOP). This group of people is the largest, but the poorest socio-economic group in the world. These approximately 4 billion people have been ignored by the multinational companies until very recently. Being connected {{is one of the main}} building blocks of the digital societies and mobile phones are bridging the digital divide. Being connected virtually seems to be all the time more important part of development and functioning of the modern societies both in the developed and developing world. Objective of the study The purpose of this thesis was to build a framework of key impact areas and dimensions of mobility and present a holistic picture of this wide phenomenon by answering the question: What types of benefits can mobile technology provide at the BOP markets? As the whole phenomenon of benefits and impacts of mobility is abstract and the impacts are wide reaching, a simplified framework of the phenomenon was needed. The aim was to widen the theoretical discussion and theory formulation concerning the benefits of mobility. The purpose was also to examine the affordability and accessibility restrictions in the field of mobile communications at the BOP. Data and methodology The primary data of the study consist of 43 discussions with experts from Nokia as well as researchers and active players in the field of Information and Communication technology (ICT). This thesis has journalistic properties as discussions with experts have been combined with wide amount of other content, such as, surveys, researches and blogs. Findings This thesis widened understanding of how people use mobile phones at the BOP. Mobile phones have impacted on how people live, work, communicate and socialise locally and globally. The wide reach and sheer magnitude of mobile communications change the functioning of societies. Thesis demonstrated multiple benefits of mobile phones: from decreasing negative aspects (e. g., corruption and high prices because of information asymmetry etc.) to highlighting benefits (e. g., education and health reach, energy efficiency, electoral oversight). All these impacts can be achieved only if the right levels of access and pricing are achieved. Accessibility and affordability aspects are very crucial for low income consumers in the BOP markets...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{model was}} {{developed}} to simulate winter wheat production on irrigated farmland similar to that found near Hermiston, Oregon. The simulated farm is irrigated with a side roll sprinkler system. A well is located adjacent to the wheat field and the water is delivered by an electrically powered pump. The major components of the model are: 1. The soil moisture component which estimates daily soil moisture level. The soil moisture level {{is a function of}} daily precipitation, daily irrigation and daily evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of measured pan evaporation, wheat plant stage of development and the soil moisture level. 2. The irrigation component which schedules daily irrigation based on the decision strategies supplied by the model user. There are three major parts of each strategy, the irrigation system design, the set time in hours and the soil moisture level that initiates irrigation. 3. The yield component of the model which estimates wheat grain yield as a function of daily temperature, daily soil moisture, and stage of plant growth. The scheduling of irrigation will create variability in the soil moisture level across the field. This variability of soil moisture is incorporated in the yield component. 4. The risk/returns component which calculates the net returns and utility. Utility is equal to the average net return minus the standard deviation weighted by a risk aversion factor. Wheat production was simulated for 19 years of daily weather data from the Hermiston Agricultural Experiment Station from 1963 - 1981. Several strategies were compared. The comparisons were made of the yields, water use, irrigation costs, net returns, risk and utility of the various strategies. The strategies were ranked according to maximum utility. The results indicated that designing irrigation systems for maximum yields did not result in the highest utility. The optimum strategies were those that initiated irrigation at a low level of soil moisture depletion and used a system with a relatively lower capital investment. The average annualized investment cost f or the five strategies with the highest yields was 76. 43 per acre. The annualized investment cost for the five strategies with the highest utility was 57. 54 per acre. The difference in average utility between the two groups was 19. 37 per acre. The strategy with the highest yield had a utility level of 295. 77 per acre. The strategy with the highest utility had a utility level of 337. 12 per acre. The analysis included only those costs associated with irrigation. Utility was more sensitive to labor costs and water charges than to the cost of energy and interest rates. The level of risk aversion made very little difference in the relative level of utility for the different strategies. If the moisture holding capacity of the soil was reduced then the level of risk aversion <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> in the relative level of utility...|$|R

The galley fire was washed out half the time, the deckhouse we lived in was flooded continually; for weeks we hadn’t a rag of dry clothes, and very seldom a plateful of warm food. It was a merciful relief when the gale freshened, and she lay hove to, with the icy seas bursting over her weather bow while we slept like logs in our soaking bunks; but that wasn’t often. With each shift or fall of wind we crawled out on the yards, wet and frozen to the bone, to shake the hard canvas loose, and, as it generally happened, were sent aloft in an hour to furl it tight again. Each time it was a short-handed fight for life to master the thrashing sail. Our hands cracked open, and the cuts would not heal; stores were spoiled by the water that washed over everything, and some days we starved on a wet biscuit or two; but the demand for brutal effort never slackened. We were worn very thin when we squared away for the north with the first fair wind.” ...|$|E
