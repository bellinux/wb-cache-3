It is also a wide range, strong professional structure of the system, it {{is closely related to}} the development of construction technology, the need to gradually improve building materials production level and engineering practice. <b>Main</b> factory <b>building</b> structure <b>system</b> to achieve light weight, high strength, reliable technology, economy applicable, expanding for dry operation, should be combined closely with plant production process, good solution can be achieved. Therefore, choose the <b>main</b> factory <b>building</b> structure, give full play to the bearing capacity of each structure, improve the level of <b>main</b> factory <b>building</b> design, construction technology,to accelerate the progress of <b>main</b> <b>building</b> structure <b>system</b> plays an important role. ...|$|R

Stanbridge was {{then known as}} the Communications Control Centre (CCC or Commcen Central) and was {{the hub of the}} Defence Communications Network (DCN). The <b>main</b> <b>building</b> hosted <b>Systems</b> Control, a tape relay centre and later a Telegraphic Automatic Routing Equipment (TARE). The DCN connected sites all over the world by HF radio links using the two diverse transmitter sites and the diverse receiver sites. The Distant Terminals of these links included Canberra, Gan, Cyprus, Ottawa and Malta. Other UK sites involved were the RN site at HMS Forest Moor and RAF Oakhanger with its satellite earth-station.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to identify alternative <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> for low rise housing, {{that can be applied}} to the market of countries of the former Yugoslavia. Six <b>building</b> <b>systems,</b> developed and produced in Canada, have been selected for this purpose. In order to compare them to existing system, the set of criteria for evaluation is developed, based on three major aspects: the technical aspect deals with codes and regulations, implementation, durability and other physical characteristics of building systems; the economic aspect compares costs; and the psychological aspect investigates the level of acceptance from both the builders' and homeowners' point of view. The results of this research prove the complexity of the issue of technology transfer. Even though all evaluated <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> showed technical and, particularly economical improvements over the existing masonry, it is the issue of cultural acceptance that is the determining factor in the success of a new product. That is the <b>main</b> reason why <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> based on concrete would more likely be accepted over "light" frame systems. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Loose {{coupling}} {{is often}} quoted as a desirable property of systems architectures. One of the <b>main</b> goals of <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> using Web technologies {{is to achieve}} loose coupling. However, {{given the lack of}} a widely accepted definition of this term, it becomes hard to use coupling as a criterion to evaluate alternative Web technology choices, as all options may exhibit, and claim to provide, some kind of “loose ” coupling effects. This paper presents a systematic study of the degree of coupling found in service-oriented systems based on a multi-faceted approach. Thanks to the metric introduced in this paper, coupling is no longer a one-dimensional concept with loose coupling found somewhere in between tight coupling and no coupling. The paper shows how the metric can be applied to real-world examples in order to support and improve the design process of service-oriented systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2015. The purpose of this project is to make an efficient security system for university safety measurement which {{can also be used}} to calculate the office hours of Student Tutors by face detection and recognition. By using surveillance cameras, attached at all the entrance of university <b>main</b> <b>buildings,</b> the <b>system</b> can detect human faces and then it can recognize people. First, the system captures the image of a person who enters into the building and then detects the face from the image. Then the recognition system matches that image with the given database of images with valid information. After matching that image if the system recognize that face it gives a green signal to allow that person. Otherwise, if the system cannot recognize that face it gives an alert signal to block that person as an intruder. Also, this system calculates the office hours of the Student Tutors. By using face recognition the system takes the starting time and ending time of the Student Tutors individually and then gives the result as output by calculating the time duration...|$|R

40|$|In {{the coming}} years, remote health {{monitoring}} {{is an area}} that is expected to grow significantly. Systems designed to follow-up with patients at home can be used not only to reduce visits to the doctor but also to augment the face-to-face interactions between patients and physicians. These systems could also provide much-needed care to the millions of people living in rural areas. While many researchers are investigating remote sensing technologies, the use of self-report in technological systems for long-term health monitoring remains a relatively understudied area. In this thesis, we investigate two <b>main</b> challenges in <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> designed for the collection of self-reported health data: 1) maximizing the accuracy of the reported data, and 2) maintaining user engagement with the system over potentially long periods of time. We describe results from three field trials of systems designed to collect selfreported health data. Results indicate that personified interfaces and designs that include personalized health messages may negatively impact data quality. Results also indicated that, despite incentives designed to promote use, the time commitmen...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} the ecosystem, humans {{actions are}} forced to {{integrate}} within the natural biological cycle. As an answer to the social, environmental and economic challenges, both architects and builders are asked to adopt new building methods. From the baseline option of <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> to have the capacity of being disassembled so their components can be reused, processed, and reassembled, the main discipline that can tend to this issue is reversible and demountable architecture. The construction of the physical boundaries of the building will define the possibility of disassemblage of each element, understanding the construction as an assemblage of pieces in which joints become the most important part regarding shape and structure. This research is based on the identification and the analysis of the <b>main</b> permanent <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> with high potential of disassembly erected through time. Beyond the conclusions reached by studies focused on experiences of recent years, this study intends to start in the ancient eras. The first stage is based in those systems built in the early ages up to the times of the Scientific Revolution. There we can find in a clear and obvious way the precise balance in the correspondence between elements, space, form and function, obtaining the proper integration for each environment. On the second stage it is intended to assess the evolution of each solution and to establish its connection with more recent ones. Three different phases (documental, analytical and propositive), are developed for a proper completion of this study. There is no construction system that has completely disappeared after its invention. Essential innovative technologies remain active even they may continue to exist only in small areas, or only for supporting periodical renovations. Every construction system applied in the present supports its equivalence with another used in the past. Following this discussion, a careful reading of ancient architectural systems is able to provide the basis to define the design guidelines of reversible architecture for a more sustainable future...|$|R
