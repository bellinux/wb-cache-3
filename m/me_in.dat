40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{locate and}} review {{studies that have}} investigated the incidence of medication errors (<b>MEs)</b> <b>in</b> pediatric inpatients and identify common errors. METHODS: A systematic search of studies related to <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> children was performed using the following databases: MEDLINE (1951 -April 2006), EMBASE (1966 -April 2006), Pharm-line (1978 -April 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 -April 2006), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 -April 2006), and British Nursing Index (1994 -April 2006). Studies of the incidence and nature of <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics were included. The title, abstract, or full article was reviewed for relevance; any study not related to <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> children was excluded. RESULTS: Three methods were used to detect <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> the studies reviewed: spontaneous reporting (n = 10), medication order or chart review (n = 14), or observation (n = 8). There was great variation in the definitions of ME used and the error rates reported. The {{most common type of}} ME was dosing error, often involving 10 times the actual dose required. Antibiotics and sedatives were the most common classes of drugs associated with MEs; these are probably among the most common drugs prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of the literature was hindered by variation in definitions employed by different researchers, varying research methods and setting, and a lack of theory-based research. Overall, it would appear that our initial concern about <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics has been validated; however, we do not know the actual size of the problem. Further work to determine the incidence and causes of <b>MEs</b> <b>in</b> pediatrics is urgently needed, as well as evaluation of the best interventions to reduce them. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> the Land of Grapico. Meet <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

40|$|This is a phenomenographic study, {{of which}} {{the aim was to}} explore the {{variation}} of experiences, needs, views and understandings through a phenomenographic study of academics who were enrolled <b>in</b> the <b>MEd</b> <b>in</b> Open and Distance Learning (ODL) at Unisa during 2012 - 2015. The <b>MEd</b> <b>in</b> ODL is a dual university programme between University of South Africa (Unisa) and University of Maryland University College (UMUC). The research question was around issues which Unisa academic staff members experienced during the course of their enrolment for the <b>MEd</b> <b>in</b> ODL. Relevant scholarly literature on online learning, theories for online learning, and previous research on online learning, was surveyed in this regard. Variation theory which framed the study through a phenomenographic research lens was described. Interviews were conducted with seven participants from the students on the <b>MEd</b> <b>in</b> ODL programme. Postings on MyUnisa Discussion Forum which were treated as data were analysed in relation to the aspects raised in the interviews. The findings revealed students’ varied online experiences in the three main aspects namely, experience and understanding, understanding the object of learning and learning objects. Important recommendations made, were based on the findings. In conclusion, the findings exhibited students’ varied experiences about issues which they battle with <b>in</b> the <b>MEd</b> <b>in</b> ODL programme, of which Unisa should take into consideration as they further enrol students in the programme.
