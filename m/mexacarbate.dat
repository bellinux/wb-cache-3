50|$|<b>Mexacarbate</b> is a {{carbamate}} pesticide {{developed by}} Alexander Shulgin and marketed in 1961 by Dow Chemical Company under the trade name Zectran. As of 2009, <b>mexacarbate</b> is considered obsolete or discontinued, {{according to the}} World Health Organization.|$|E
50|$|Until it {{was banned}} in the United States in 1972, the {{pesticide}} DDT was used to control outbreaks. In 1974 the United States Forest Service tested four insecticides on oak leafroller larvae as replacements for DDT and found that less than 1 microgram of each (bioethanomethrin, <b>mexacarbate,</b> phoxim, and pyrethrins) caused 90 percent mortality. Natural predators that feed on the larvae include parasitic wasps and bird species such as mockingbirds. The sex pheremones of the species have been studied as well.|$|E
40|$|Aerial {{application}} of <b>mexacarbate</b> and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner was tested against pine butterfly, Neophasia menapia (F. and F.). These {{were applied to}} 40 -acre plots on the Bitterroot National Forest and adjacent State and private lands during June 1973. Two concentrations of each material were tested; these were 0. 15 and 0. 30 pound per acre of <b>mexacarbate,</b> and 0. 5 and 1. 0 pound of B. thuringiensis per acre. Both concentrations of <b>mexacarbate</b> caused pine butterfly population reductions of near 97 percent and B. thuringiensis provided 73 percent reduction at the â€¢ 0. 5 pound rate and 92 percent at the 1. 0 pound rate. Natural decline of late instar larval population precluded an evaluation of differences in degree of defoliation between treated and untreated areas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} high-flow (up to 2 mL/min) ion spray to the LC/MS determination of compounds of pharmaceutical and environmental interest with standard (HPLC) columns without established postcolumn splitting of the flow. It also illustrates {{the use of a}} nonvolatile mobilephase buffer, potassium phosphate, for the LC/MS determination of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). To achieve practicality and analytical ruggedness of the system, a liquid shield is placed between the sprayer and the ion sampling capillary, resulting in full-scan low-nanogram determination of quaternary ammonium drugs. The system also allows the use of gradients which is demonstrated for the analysis of carbamate pesticides and in particular for <b>mexacarbate</b> in pond water...|$|E
