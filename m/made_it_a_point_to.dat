5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} some European tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. As the band felt that The Astonishing would lend itself well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following {{the conclusion of the}} North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
25|$|I always <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> carry several extra {{copies of}} the {{leaflets}} with me whenever I was walking through the city – specifically for that purpose. Whenever I saw an opportune moment, I took it. Another Sophie Scholl quote.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then fulfil thy duties, friend," [...] {{rejoined the}} Cardinal, who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> always to speak kindly and urbanely, {{even to the}} meanest lout.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Don't {{you think}} we may as well turn now?" [...] said Mabberly, who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> always, if possible, to carry the {{approbation}} of the skipper with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Grayson {{knows best}} {{how to handle}} such an affair as this, Barbara," [...] replied her father. [...] "He is my superintendent, and I have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> never to {{interfere}} with him." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1974, Cassidy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> {{find and}} re-establish {{contact with his}} stepson. He {{eventually}} persuaded California {{to return to the}} mainland and give the band another shot. Andes worked with the duo for a while, but never intended to stay, as he {{was in the process of}} working with the group Firefall at the same time. Andes was replaced by former Frank Zappa sound engineer Barry Keene.|$|E
25|$|He {{helped in}} {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts in May 1828. They {{required}} many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal but reversed himself and led the repeal, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. In future religious issues he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> consult with church leaders from the major denominations.|$|E
25|$|Various other strict {{codes of}} conduct were to be obeyed by the {{governors}} and state officials. The principal officers were required to travel to Mecca {{on the occasion of}} the Hajj, during which people were free to present any complaint against them. In order to minimize the chances of corruption, Umar <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> pay high salaries to the staff. Provincial governors received as much as five to seven thousand dirham annually besides their shares of the spoils of war (if they were also the commander in chief of the army of their sector).|$|E
2500|$|Tancredo has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> {{in all of}} {{his public}} speeches to {{differentiate}} between those who enter the United States legally and those who come illegally. He frequently attends naturalization ceremonies to support new citizens for [...] "doing it the right way".|$|R
60|$|An {{appeal to}} his alarm {{is never a}} good plan to rid oneself of a {{spirited}} young man. My obstinacy was but increased by what she said, and I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of honour to remain. And her solicitude for my safety still more confirmed me in the resolve.|$|R
60|$|After this, therefore, {{the three}} men had their meals in the kitchen, where they were {{generally}} joined by Mrs. Aleshine, who much delighted in their company. But she <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> sometimes {{to sit down with}} us in the dining-room, merely to show that she had as much right there as anybody.|$|R
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and {{he was not going to}} hurt her.|$|E
25|$|Snow Patrol next did a month-long tour of US and Canada, {{following}} a hugely successful SXSW appearance and a sold out US Tour in March. The Duke Spirit and Augustana were booked as support acts. The tour included an in-store performance at HMV to kick-off the Canadian dates. An autograph session was held after the set. The band chose Denver specifically {{to be the}} location of the first concert. They had kept the city as a surprise location on a previous tour two years before and had visited there for the first time, expect lukewarm reaction. However, the concert sold out and the band had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> return in the future.|$|E
25|$|The platoon {{who rushed}} to Bo. Capaya {{in search of}} the rebel band found the barrio deserted, the {{inhabitants}} having fled for fear of Spanish reprisal. However, in an outlying field, they found a lone farmer tending his baritan, a small field of a special grass called barit that was sold and fed to calesa (carriage) horses. The farmer was Roman Payumu, a humble zacatero, a gatherer and provider of animal feed like grass for horses. Although illiterate and ignorant family man, he was very industrious and a good provider. He was a deeply religious man with an intense faith in God and a very devout Catholic. After selling all his barit grass to carriage drivers in the town marketplace every evening, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> pray fervently at the Holy Rosary Parish Church in Angeles town proper. When the Quinario devotion, prior to the fiesta of Apung Mamacalulu, was instituted on October 23, 1897, he quickly volunteered as a regular cargador (bearer) of the Apu during processions where he was popularly known by his nickname, Duman.|$|E
50|$|Muslims made {{up almost}} half of the {{students}} in the diocesan school where Gonzaga taught. The school <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> not to force or encourage them to join Catholic services, but instead tried to merely be accepted in their “apostolate of presence.” After school hours the sisters would visit the students in their homes.|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of the}} X Games, {{there have}} been {{performances}} by various rock bands over the years, {{as well as a}} DJ being on-site at all events. [...] The X Games have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> since its founding to stage an eco-friendly event. Such measures include using biodiesel fuel in their vehicles and organizing recycling campaigns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Grayson," [...] he said, [...] "I have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> {{never to}} {{interfere}} with you; but I am {{going to ask you}} now not to pursue Mr. Bridge. I shall be glad if he makes good his escape. Barbara was right--he is a fellow-American. We cannot turn him over to Villa, or any other Mexican to be murdered." ...|$|R
500|$|Shiban began {{crafting}} {{his story}} by borrowing a nanobot plot {{that had been}} considered by various writers for several seasons. Shiban {{and the rest of}} the writers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> give Alex Krycek control over Skinner. In this manner, Skinner once again became a mysterious character, one whose true loyalties were being tested. Shiban noted that, [...] " [...] gives Skinner an agenda that Mulder doesn't know about [...] Which was something we ultimately used again in the seasonender , and will carry us into next year".|$|E
500|$|Hawks was a {{versatile}} director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks's own functional {{definition of what}} constitutes a [...] "good movie" [...] is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: [...] "Three great scenes, no bad ones." [...] Hawks also defined a good director as [...] "someone who doesn't annoy you." [...] In Hawks's own words, his directing style is based on being enjoyable and straightforward. His style was very actor-focused and he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.|$|E
500|$|Despite Euler's immense {{contribution}} to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of Frederick and ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, {{in many ways the}} polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit. Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities: ...|$|E
60|$|To {{her right}} {{was a small}} farm across which she had never ridden, for she always had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> never to {{trespass}} upon fenced grounds. On {{the opposite side of}} the farm was a wood, and somewhere beyond that a small stream which the highroad crossed upon <b>a</b> little bridge. <b>It</b> was all new country to her, but it must be ventured.|$|R
50|$|The city's {{distinctive}} shape <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> rallying <b>point</b> for Allied bombers {{returning to}} England after raids on Germany.|$|R
2500|$|A {{major factor}} in the primary {{campaign}} was DeWine's marriage. In 2004, DeWine's opponent ran ads calling attention to DeWine leaving his pregnant wife and their two children for a mistress working as <b>a</b> lobbyist. Schmidt <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> in her stump speech to emphasize how long she had been married to her husband: [...] "I am a woman of character who has been married for twenty-nine years." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew {{in spite of my}} brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Towton was {{associated}} with a tradition previously upheld in the villages of Tysoe, Warwickshire. For centuries the villagers had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> clear an area on a slope of the Vale of the Red Horse on each anniversary of the engagement, exposing a large figure of a horse cut into the red soil. They claimed to do this to honour the Earl of Warwick's inspirational deed of slaying his horse to show his resolve to stand and fight with the common soldiers. Local historian Mary Dormer Harris believed that the villagers modified the original Red Horse, which dated to pre-historic times, to a version that reflected mediaeval horses. The tradition died in 1798 when the Inclosure Acts implemented by the English government redesignated the common land, on which the equine figure was located, as private property. [...] The scouring was revived during the early 20th century but has since stopped.|$|E
500|$|Akbar's son, Emperor Jahangir, also {{continued}} {{the practice of}} Jharokha Darshan. In Agra Fort, the jharokha window {{is part of the}} structure which represents the Shah Burj, the Royal Tower. The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion. During Jahangir's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan. During Jahangir's Jharokha Darshan, hanging a string to tie petitions, was also practiced. This was also a Persian system under naushrwan. Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it. Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas. Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick; he had said [...] "even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharokha, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed custom." ...|$|E
60|$|Thereupon the Captain, {{with much}} alacrity, {{shouldered}} his book--for he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of duty to read none but very large books on a Sunday, {{as having a}} more staid appearance: and had bargained, years ago, for a prodigious volume at a book-stall, five lines of which utterly confounded him at any time, insomuch {{that he had not}} yet ascertained of what subject it treated--and withdrew. Walter soon appeared.|$|R

"Close on Ashley's heels now, Hatherell too {{cuts across}} the Square, and reaches the further gate {{in good time}} to give his confederate a hand in {{disposing}} the body against the railings. Then, without another instant's delay, Ashley runs back across the gardens, straight to the Ashton Club, throwing away the keys of the dead man, on the very spot where he had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of being seen and heard by a passer-by.|$|R
5000|$|Tim Moore (December 9, 1887 - December 13, 1958) was an American vaudevillian {{and comic}} actor {{of the first}} half of the 20th century. He gained his {{greatest}} recognition in the starring role of George [...] "Kingfish" [...] Stevens in the CBS television series Amos 'n' Andy. He proudly stated, [...] "I've <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> never to tell a joke on stage that I couldn't tell in front of my mother." ...|$|R
500|$|Graded by {{a medical}} board as only being fit for {{administrative}} duties, Kippenberger still harboured hopes {{of returning to}} the 2nd Division. However, he was named to replace Brigadier James Hargest, {{who had been killed}} in France in August, as commander of the New Zealand Reception Group. This organisation had been formed to arrange accommodation as well as social and medical services for New Zealand military personnel who were expected to be released from prisoner of war camps in Germany when the war ended. These personnel were to be evacuated to England to await repatriation to New Zealand. It was recognised that transition from the harsh life as a captive to normal life may be difficult for some, and the Reception Group provided much needed support for these individuals. [...] He threw himself into his new role, setting up facilities and accommodation centres around Dover. The first former prisoners of war began arriving in late March 1945, and Kippenberger <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> personally meet with each group of arrivals. By the following October, the overwhelming majority of released personnel had been returned to New Zealand, negating the need for the Reception Group.|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli {{commented that}} [...] "in the end, the events {{surrounding}} 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone {{who knows how to}} sell a concept." [...] Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> have the commercial be dictated by her. While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the soft drink, she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that [...] "Madonna the pop star {{was going to do it}} her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do". She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after [...] "Like a Prayer", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.|$|E
500|$|Kempelen would {{inform the}} player that the Turk {{would use the}} white pieces and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it {{threatened}} its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine [...] "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent {{was not to be}} so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her". Kempelen <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.|$|E
60|$|I {{fell away}} dreadfully, {{more and more}} I shirked and skulked; the humped men from the north, the pale men with thin, clenched minds, the intent, hard-breathing {{students}} I found against me, fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt. Even a girl got above me upon one of the lists. Then indeed I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that I really did not even pretend to try.|$|R
60|$|Clementina had {{rather it}} had been too late {{to go with the}} Milrays, but she felt bound to own her {{decision}} when she reached it; and Mrs. Milray, whatever her real wish was, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of honor to help get Mrs. Lander berths on her steamer. It did not require much effort; there are plenty of berths for the latest-comers on a winter passage, and Clementina found herself the fellow passenger of Mrs. Milray.|$|R
6000|$|... "Knowing how scarce {{food was}} and the {{uncertainty}} of when he would get the next meal, Mr. Wolverine always <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> on these occasions to stuff himself until <b>it</b> was <b>a</b> wonder his skin didn't burst. If {{there was more than}} he could eat, he would take a nap right there, and because of fear of him the rightful owner of the food would not dare take what was left. When he awoke Mr. Wolverine would finish what remained.|$|R
