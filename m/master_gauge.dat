40|$|As an {{illustration}} of the formalism of the master field we consider generalised $QCD_ 2 $. We show how Wilson Loop averages for an arbitrary contour can be computed explicitly and with some ease. A generalised Hopf equation is shown to govern the behaviour of the eigenvalue density of Wilson loops. The collective field description of the theory is therefore deduced. Finally, the non-trivial <b>master</b> <b>gauge</b> field and field strengths are obtained. These results do not seem easily accessible with conventional means.

40|$|The basic {{concepts}} of non-commutative probability theory are reviewed {{and applied to}} the large $N$ limit of matrix models. We argue {{that this is the}} appropriate framework for constructing the master field in terms of which large $N$ theories can be written. We explicitly construct the master field in a number of cases including QCD$_ 2 $. There we both give an explicit construction of the <b>master</b> <b>gauge</b> field and construct master loop operators as well. Most important we extend these techniques to deal with the general matrix model, in which the matrices do not have independent distributions and are coupled. We can thus construct the master field for any matrix model, in a well defined Hilbert space, generated by a collection of creation and annihilation operators [...] -one for each matrix variable [...] -satisfying the Cuntz algebra. We also discuss the equations of motion obeyed by the master field. Comment: 46 pages plus 11 uuencoded eps figure...|$|E
40|$|The AdS(5) superalgebra PSU(2, 2 / 4) has an {{infinite}} dimensional extension, which we denote by hs(2, 2 / 4). We {{show that the}} gauging of hs(2, 2 / 4) {{gives rise to a}} spectrum of physical massless fields which coincides with the symmetric tensor product of two AdS(5) spin- 1 doubletons (i. e. the N = 4 SYM multiplets living on the boundary of AdS 5). This product decomposes into levels l = 0, 1, 2, [...] .,infinity of massless supermultiplets of PSU(2, 2 / 4). In particular, the D = 5, N = 8 supergravity multiplet arises at level l = 0. In addition to a <b>master</b> <b>gauge</b> field, we construct a master scalar field containing the s = 0, 1 / 2 fields, the anti-symmetric tensor field of the gauged supergravity and its higher spin analogs. We define the linearized constraints and obtain the linearized field equations of the full spectrum, including those of D = 5, N = 8 gauged supergravity and in particular the self-duality equations for the 2 -form potentials of the gauged supergravity (forming a 6 -plet of SU(4)), and their higher spin cousins with s = 2, 3, [...] .,infinity...|$|E
5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the international prototype meter. This bar of metal, like the , is maintained under controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures headquarters in France, {{which is one of}} the principal measurement standards laboratories of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as NIST), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such <b>master</b> <b>gauges</b> are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as [...] "NIST traceable" [...] means that its comparison against <b>master</b> <b>gauges,</b> and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.|$|R

50|$|In practice, the {{universal}} measuring machine {{is a very}} slow machine that requires a highly skilled and patient operator to use, and the accuracy built into these machines far outstripped the needs of most industries. As a result, {{the universal}} measuring machine today is only found as a special-purpose machine in metrology laboratories. Because the machine can make comparative length measurements without moving linear axes, it is a valuable tool in comparing <b>master</b> <b>gauges</b> and length standards. While universal measuring machines were never a mass-produced item, {{they are no longer}} available on a production basis, and are produced on a to-order basis tailored {{to the needs of the}} metrology lab purchasing it. Manufacturers that perform work that must be measured on such a machine will frequently opt to subcontract the measurement to a laboratory which specializes in such.|$|R
40|$|We use Grassmann even spinor {{oscillators}} {{to construct}} a bosonic higher spin extension hs(2, 2) of the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter algebra SU(2, 2), and show that the gauging of hs(2, 2) {{gives rise to a}} spectrum S of physical massless fields with spin s = 0, 2, 4, [...] . that is a UIR of hs(2, 2). In addition to a <b>master</b> <b>gauge</b> field which contains the massless s = 2, 4, [...] fields, we construct a scalar master field containing the massless s = 0 field, the generalized Weyl tensors and their derivatives. We give the appropriate linearized constraint on this master scalar field, which together with a linearized curvature constraint produces the correct linearized field equations. A crucial step {{in the construction of the}} theory is the identification of a central generator K which is eliminated by means of a coset construction. Its charge vanishes in the spectrum S, which is the symmetric product of two spin zero doubletons. We expect our results to pave the way for constructing an interacting theory whose curvature expansion is dual to a CFT based on higher spin currents formed out of free doubletons in the large N limit. Thus, extending a recent proposal of Sundborg (hep-th/ 0103247), we conjecture that the hs(2, 2) gauge theory describes a truncation of the bosonic massless sector of tensionless Type IIB string theory o...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{two things}} are done. First, it is shown that any global {{symmetry}} of a gauge-invariant theory can be extended to the ghosts and the antifields so as to leave invariant {{the solution of the}} <b>master</b> equation (before <b>gauge</b> fixing). Second, it is proved that the incorporation of the rigid symmetries to the solution of the master equation through the introduction of a constant ghost for each global symmetry can be obstructed already at the classical level whenever the theory possesses higher order conservation laws.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the potential of transient thermography in the nondestructive evaluation of structural defects of NECURON 1001 using the FLIR thermographic system. Necuron is a polyurethane material used for applications like: fixture and <b>gauges,</b> <b>master</b> and copy models, models with high mechanical stress, etc. Transient thermography is a thermographic method which implies the investigation of materials that are of a different (often higher) temperature than the ambient. The heat flow into the sample is altered {{in the presence of}} a subsurface defect or feature, creating a temperature contrast at the surface that is recorded by the infrared system. Results show that this method of evaluation can indicate, in necuron, defects of small sizes that can be overlooked in the manufacturing process. Also, it was shown that the transient thermography method presented can be an important tool in evaluating structural defects of materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{electronic}} or pneumatic multi-section and multi-probe gauges {{are widely}} used for diameter and coaxiality measurements due to their high measurement efficiency in workshops. However, their measurement accuracy is determined mainly by the manufacturing errors of the assembly coaxiality master, therefore, how to establish coaxiality measurement datum reference is the key technology. The physical coaxiality masters {{are expected to be}} the impossible "zero error datum reference". The higher manufacturing accuracy of the masters, the more expensive for their manufacturing costs. A novel mathematical method on the basis of error separation principle was proposed in order to separate the manufacturing errors of the master. The basic principle is that the eccentric error of the coaxiality master can be expressed as the first harmonic function and the ideal zero-error datum reference could be established by the mathematical method of two sampling operations in phase difference of 180 ° in coaxiality <b>master</b> for <b>gauge</b> initialization. This method can be called as "mathematical datum reference " for coaxiality measurement. Experimental results indicate that the coaxiality measurement results of the multi-section and multi-probe gauge by the novel mathematical method coincide with those of the three-coordinate measuring machine and the maximum difference of both is about 0. 0014 mm. The new coaxiality measurement principle can separate the datum error of the coaxiality master theoretically and can improve the coaxiality measurement accuracy greatly with the common accuracy coaxiality master...|$|R
