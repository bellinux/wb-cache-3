5|$|Slovenia– September 2011– Following {{the failure}} of June referendums on {{measures}} to combat the economic crisis and the departure of coalition partners, the Borut Pahor government lost a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and December 2011 early elections were set, following which Janez Janša became PM. After a year of rigorous saving measures, and also due to continuous opening of ideological question, the centre-right government of Janez Janša was ousted on 27 February 2013 by nomination of Alenka Bratušek as the PM-designated of a new centre-left coalition government.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> affirming {{their support for}} Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and {{is followed by a}} general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E

25|$|UDEUR's {{defection}} {{forced the}} question of whether Prodi still had the parliamentarian support to govern. Presenting a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> to parliament, he won relatively easily in the lower house of the Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, where the coalition's majority was substantial. Yet a win in the upper house – or Senate – seemed unlikely, and President Giorgio Napolitano was said to have warned against going through with the vote.|$|E
25|$|The Government {{is instead}} {{headed by the}} Prime Minister, whose duty is to {{coordinate}} the government and provide for {{the administration of the}} country. Following his designation by the President, he must present himself before the Parliament to pass a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confidence.</b> He can replace the President in the Council of Ministers, but only on his former mandate. His acts, in the specific areas, must be signed also by the relevant minister.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{appointment}} was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, {{not having enough}} time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} no {{commonly}} accepted and comprehensive definition <b>of</b> a <b>confidence</b> <b>motion</b> {{it is possible to}} identify confidence motions from their timing, the speakers and the terms <b>of</b> the <b>motion.</b> <b>Motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> are supportive <b>of</b> the Government whereas <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> are unsupportive <b>of</b> the Government. It can be difficult to distinguish an opposition no confidence motion and other opposition <b>motions</b> critical <b>of</b> Government policy. The term censure motion can also refer a category <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> which does not attempt to remove the Government.|$|R

50|$|On 15 May 2014, Carcasses {{was ousted}} in a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> New Prime Minister Joe Natuman {{appointed}} Lini his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Commerce. Lini lost office on 11 June 2015 when the Natuman government was ousted in a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2000, {{the first}} cabinet of Bondevik {{resigned}} following an unsuccessful <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> Stoltenberg's first cabinet governed Norway from 17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001. Stoltenberg was the deputy {{leader of the}} labor party while Jagland was the party leader. Instead Jagland was given the post as Foreign Minister. Stoltenberg's first tenure as Prime Minister (2000–2001) was controversial within his own party, being responsible for reforms and modernisation {{of the welfare state}} that included part-privatising several key state-owned services and corporations. In the parliamentary election of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its worst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Despite both being Bengali and hailing from East Bengal, the {{two leaders}} had very {{different}} views of running the government and both leader were in brief conflict, causing the harm to {{the unity of the}} nation. Prime Minister Suhrawardy found extremely difficult to govern effectively due to the issue of one unit, alleviating the national economy, and President Mirza's constant unconstitutional interference in Suhrawardy administration. President Mirza demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Suhrawardy and turned down his request to seek <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> at the National Assembly. Threatened by President Mirza's dismissal, Prime Minister Suhrawardy tendered his resignation on 17 October 1957 and was succeeded by I. I. Chundrigar but he too was forced to resigned in mere two months.|$|E
25|$|The deal {{turned out}} to be rather unnecessary, as the Conservatives opted to ensure the government's {{survival}} on the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> surrounding the original budget, expressing support to the tax cuts and defence spending therein. When Parliament voted on second reading and referral of the budget and the amendment on May 19, the previous events kept the government alive. The original budget bill, C-43, passed easily, as expected, but the amendment bill, C-48, resulted in an equality of votes, and the Speaker of the House broke the tie to continue the parliament. The government never got as close to falling after that date. Third reading of Bill C-48 was held late at night on an unexpected day, and several Conservatives being absent, the motion passed easily, guaranteeing there would be no election in the near future.|$|E
50|$|On 15 May 2014, Carcasses {{was ousted}} in a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> New Prime Minister Joe Natuman {{appointed}} Kilman his Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

50|$|In early June 2015, Natuman sacked Foreign Affairs Minister Sato Kilman, {{for having}} said {{publicly}} {{that he could}} support a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> against the government. He subsequently {{announced that he had}} also removed Justice Minister Alfred Carlot, appointing Opposition MP Hosea Nevu (Iauko Group, MP for Santo Rural) in his place. Opposition MP Kalvau Moli (Independent MP for Luganville) was appointed as Foreign Affairs Minister. The two newly appointed ministers duly withdrew their names from the Opposition's intended <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> against the government. Nonetheless, the government fell to a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> on 11 June.|$|R
25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, {{as there is no}} method for a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.|$|E
25|$|Tembo and Msonthi, {{the only}} two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> but Banda's lengthy speech {{dominated}} it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in Dar es Salaam. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him {{to remain in the}} cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as {{the first day of the}} debate had gone in Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a back-bencher, sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.|$|E
2500|$|The Norway Debate was {{technically}} {{a motion}} [...] "that this house do now adjourn". Under Westminster rules in such debates, held {{to allow for}} wide-ranging discussion {{of a variety of}} topics, the question is not usually not put to a vote. In this case, the Opposition forced a vote to demonstrate their deep concern and so this vote was effectively on a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The 31st Canadian Parliament was a briefly lived {{parliament}} in session from October 9 until December 14, 1979. [...] The membership was {{set by the}} 1979 federal election on May 22, 1979, and it was dissolved after the minority government of Joe Clark failed to pass a <b>Motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confidence</b> on December 13, 1979. The dissolution of parliament led to the 1980 federal election. [...] Lasting only 66 days from first sitting to dissolution, and only nine months from election to election, the 31st was the shortest {{parliament in}} Canadian history.|$|E
2500|$|Gorton {{called a}} Liberal caucus meeting for 10 March 1971 {{to settle the}} matter. A <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in his {{leadership}} was tied. Under Liberal caucus rules of the time, a tied vote meant the motion was lost, and hence Gorton could have remained as party leader and Prime Minister without further ado. [...] However, he {{took it upon himself}} to resign, saying [...] "Well, that is not a vote of confidence, so the party will have to elect a new leader." [...] A ballot was held and McMahon was elected leader and thus Prime Minister. Australian television marked the end of Gorton's stormy premiership with a newsreel montage appropriately accompanied by Sinatra's anthem My Way.|$|E
2500|$|In {{february}} 2000, {{still reeling}} from the 36.9 fiasco and the growing popularity of deputy party leader Stoltenberg, Jagland withdraw as a prime minister candidate. Speaking to the national council of Labour on the 10th of February 2000, Jagland said [...] "If I were to continue as prime minister candidate, and especially if I should return as prime minister, the pressure that has been put against me the last three years will only continue and increase in strength." [...] Only 35 days later, the first cabinet of Bondevik resigned following a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> A new Labour cabinet, to be led by Jens Stoltenberg, was announced by King Harald V on 17 March 2000. Jagland was chosen for Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
50|$|When the Democratic-Liberal {{government}} began supporting shale gas extraction in 2012, the Social-Democratic Party voiced its opposition. In April 2012, a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> {{written by the}} Social-Democrats led to {{the fall of the}} Ungureanu government. The <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> blamed the government for approving shale gas extraction without an appropriate legislative framework and without any geological studies.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, passage <b>of</b> a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> is a {{relatively}} rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, party discipline is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence,</b> and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies rather than lose a vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> The cases in which a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> has passed are generally those {{in which the government}} party's slim majority has been eliminated by either by-elections or defections, such as the 1979 vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> in the Callaghan ministry in the UK which was carried by one vote, forcing a general election which was won by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party.|$|R
5000|$|In many {{parliamentary}} democracies, strict {{time limits}} exist {{as to the}} proposal <b>of</b> a no <b>confidence</b> <b>motion,</b> with a vote only allowed once every three, four or six months. Thus the timing <b>of</b> a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> {{is a matter of}} political judgement; using a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> on a relatively trivial matter may prove counterproductive if a more important issue suddenly arises which warrants a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence,</b> because a motion cannot be proposed if one had been voted on recently. Sometimes, the government will choose to declare that one of its bills is a [...] "motion of confidence" [...] in order to prevent dissident members of parliament from voting against it.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the government's tenuous {{minority}} position, {{there was}} a strong possibility that the government could have fallen on a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> through the budget bills, causing the bill to die on the order paper. It would then have been up to a new post-election government to re-introduce the bill affirming same-sex marriage (or to introduce a bill, of uncertain constitutionality, defining marriage as one man and one woman). [...] However, the government survived the last of the budget votes on June 23, 2005, and successfully passed a motion to extend the current sitting of Parliament. In order to pass the motion extending the session, the Liberals provided a written promise to the Bloc Québécois that they would bring C-38 to a vote {{before the end of the}} current session.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, Schröder {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda; Franz Müntefering succeeded him as chairman. On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections [...] "as soon as possible". A <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> was subsequently defeated in the Bundestag on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections.

2500|$|In the stir {{created by}} the revelations of Cowen's {{meetings}} with Fitzpatrick, Labour Party Leader Eamon Gilmore announced his plan to table a third {{motion of no confidence}} in Cowen's government. At the time, however, Cowen’s more immediate concern was pressure from within his own party to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil. Cowen announced on 16 January 2011 that he would not resign as party leader of his own accord; however, he would put down a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in his leadership at Fianna Fáil's parliamentary party meeting on 18 January, to be decided by secret ballot. Foreign Minister Micheál Martin publicly announced that he would vote against the motion, effectively presenting himself as a challenger to Cowen's leadership. On the evening of 18 January Government Chief Whip John Curran announced that Cowen had prevailed in the confidence vote, although the exact counts were to remain secret and the ballots had been shredded. Cowen also announced that he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] accepted Martin's resignation from his government.|$|E
