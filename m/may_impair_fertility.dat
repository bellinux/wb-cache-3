40|$|Reproductive {{potential}} in women declines with age. Age-related {{changes in the}} ovary account {{for most of this}} loss of reproductive function. Oocytes, all of which are present at birth, decline in number and quality with age. The endocrine function of the ovary also declines with age, and the ovary becomes unable to sustain its normal function in the neuroendocrine axis. The neuroendocrine axis may be further affected by primary changes occurring in the hypothalamus and pituitary during aging, although this has not been established in humans. Aging also affects the function of the uterus as the endometrium loses its ability to support implantation and growth of an embryo. Diminished uterine function during aging may be due to changes in the uterine vasculature or to changes in the hormone-dependent development of the endometrium. Finally, aging increases a woman's risk of developing medical, gynecologic or obstetric conditions that <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> her <b>fertility.</b> Knowledge of these affects of aging on a woman's reproductive function is essential to advise and treat the growing number of women seeking pregnancy at advanced reproductive age...|$|R

Its runoff into local water systems and later into larger water systems raises environmental and health concerns. Some studies show Atrazine <b>may</b> cause <b>impaired</b> <b>fertility,</b> delayed onset of puberty, liver degeneration, etc. Atrazine contamination in water streams are in the low nanogram/ml range. The objective of this project is the design and testing of a nanosensor for trace detection of Atrazine and to increase sensing sensitivity by lowering the detection limit. The biosensor uses nanoporous membranes to achieve ultra-low detection of Atrazine. The detection assay uses antibody– antigen binding chemistry to achieve detection. Binding is detected through impedance spectroscopy as a cascading charge transfer results from specific binding between the antibody and Atrazine. The change in impedance before and after binding is recorded from the biosensor. The change correlates to the Atrazine concentration within the sample. By increasing sensing sensitivity to detect lower concentrations of Atrazine in water systems, environmental and health concerns from Atrazine exposure can be addressed in quicker and more efficient manner.

40|$|Abstract. Most captive female {{elephants}} are nulliparous and {{aged and}} many have endometrial disease, factors that may hinder fertility. This study characterized the pathologic features and demographic distribution of endometrial lesions from 27 captive Asian (Elephas maximus) and 13 African elephants (Loxodonta afri-canus), 12 - to 57 -years of age. The principal lesion was marked cystic and polypoid endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), present in 67 % of Asian and 15 % of African elephants ranging from 26 to 57 years. The lower prevalence in African elephants likely reflects their younger age range in this study. Fourteen of 15 affected elephants with breeding information were nulliparous.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: People in {{developed}} countries are widely exposed to low levels of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Seafood is {{a major contributor to}} PCB exposure. Toxicity of those various pollutants to reproductive and endocrine functions raises questions about possible effects on fertility. We explored whether serum levels of these pollutants and seafood consumption were associated with the fertility of couples enrolled in a French birth cohort (PELAGIE). METHODS: Time-to-pregnancy was investigated in 3, 421 pregnant women by asking how many months they had taken to conceive. Levels of 14 organochlorine pesticides, 12 PCBs, and 10 PBDE compounds were measured in cord blood serum from a random subcohort (n = 394). Mercury concentrations measured in maternal hair were considered as a potential coexposure. Fecundability odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from multivariate discrete-time Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Shellfish consumption was associated with longer time-to-pregnancy (fecundability OR ≥twice/week vs. 0. 410 µg/L vs. < 0. 266 µg/L, fecundability OR = 0. 46 [0. 32 - 0. 66]). In multiple sensitivity analyses, reduced fecundability was most consistently associated with shellfish consumption, p,p'-DDE, total PCBs, PCB 153, and PCB 187. Models that simultaneously included multiple coexposure factors led to similar conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were robust in sensitivity analyses, including analysis restricted to primiparous women. These results suggest that PCBs, p,p'-DDE, and other shellfish contaminants <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> human <b>fertility...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Autoimmune {{diseases}} may selectively affect {{women in}} their reproductive years, and conversely, pregnancy may affect the expression of autoimmune disease. This review addresses the impact of abnormal autoim-munity on female fertility, premature ovarian failure (POF) and recurrent pregnancy loss, {{as well as the}} influence of pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: From a PubMed search, citations were selected for their immunological and gynecological relevance. RESULTS: The presence of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) does neither correlate with the type of female infertility diagnosis nor affect outcomes, and treatment is not indicated. Auto-immunity as a cause of POF is probably limited to the cases associated with the autoimmune thyroid diseases. With respect to recurrent spontaneous abortion, there is no consensus on the mechanisms of an autoimmune effect, although vasculopathy of the terminal spiral arteries may be implicated, but there is a general consensus to screen for aPL when recurrent spontaneous abortion is unexplained. Well-designed diagnostic studies are needed to estimate the true association between specific autoantibodies and recurrent spontaneous abortion. With respect to SLE, pregnancy should be avoided when the disease is active, and the potentially harmful impact of pregnancy can be minimized by multi-disciplinary care.

40|$|Human {{infertility}} {{has been}} increasing worldwide but the exact causes are not yet known. Male infertility, which currently accounts for approximately half of all cases, {{has been increasing}} faster than female. While certain cases of male infertility are due to anatomical abnormalities, an estimated 40 - 49 % of cases are due to deficient sperm production of unidentifiable origin. There is growing body of scientific evidence supporting the idea that sperm counts have declined considerably over the last 50 years. Over the last few decades, there have been progressive changes in aspects of our diet, lifestyle as well as environment. Report {{in recent years has}} shown that the incident of male infertility has increased as a result of various factors such as environmental pollution, stress and lifestyle. Among lifestyle, factors such as tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco chewing, alcohol intake, high temperature, some modern electronic gadget and obesity have shown to adversely affect reproduction. These factors <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> male <b>fertility</b> by interfering with spermatogenesis, spermiogenesis, motility, sperm DNA and chromatin integrity, hormonal regulation or by reducing the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis {{infections are}} {{prevalent}} worldwide, but current research, screening and treatment is focussed on females, with {{the burden of}} disease and infertility sequelae considered predominantly a female problem. However, the prevalence of chlamydial infection is similar in males and females. Furthermore, a role for this pathogen {{in the development of}} male urethritis, epididymitis and orchitis is widely accepted. While the role of Chlamydia in the development of prostatitis is controversial, we suggest that Chlamydia is an aetiological agent, with incidences of up to 39. 5 % reported in prostatitis patients. Infection of the testis and prostate is implicated in a deterioration of sperm, possibly affecting fertility. Chlamydia infections may also affect male fertility by directly damaging the sperm, as sperm parameters, proportion of DNA fragmentation, and acrosome reaction capacity are impaired with chlamydial infection. Furthermore, the proportion of male partners of infertile couples with evidence of a Chlamydia infection is greater than documented in the general population. An effect of male chlamydial infection on the fertility of the female partner has also been reported. Thus the need for a vaccine to protect both males and females is proposed. The difficulty arises because the male reproductive tract is an immune privileged site which can be disrupted, potentially affecting spermatogenesis, if inappropriate inflammatory responses are provoked. Examination of responses to infection in humans and in experimental animal models suggest that an IgA-inducing vaccine will be able to effectively target the male reproductive tract, while avoiding harmful inflammatory responses that <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> <b>fertility...</b>|$|E
40|$|Human {{sperm cell}} {{function}} must be precisely regulated to achieve natural fertilization. Progesterone {{released by the}} cumulus cells surrounding the egg induces a Ca 2 + influx into human sperm cells via the CatSper Ca 2 +-channel and thereby controls sperm function. Multiple chemical UV filters {{have been shown to}} induce a Ca 2 + influx through CatSper, thus mimicking the effect of progesterone on Ca 2 + signaling. We hypothesized that these UV filters could also mimic the effect of progesterone on sperm function. We examined 29 UV filters allowed in sunscreens in the US and/or EU for their ability to affect acrosome reaction, penetration, hyperactivation and viability in human sperm cells. We found that, similar to progesterone, the UV filters 4 -MBC, 3 -BC, Meradimate, Octisalate, BCSA, HMS and OD-PABA induced acrosome reaction and 3 -BC increased sperm penetration into a viscous medium. The capacity of the UV filters to induce acrosome reaction and increase sperm penetration was positively associated with the ability of the UV filters to induce a Ca 2 + influx. None of the UV filters induced significant changes in the proportion of hyperactivated cells. In conclusion, chemical UV filters that mimic the effect of progesterone on Ca 2 + signaling in human sperm cells can similarly mimic the effect of progesterone on acrosome reaction and sperm penetration. Human exposure to these chemical UV filters <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> <b>fertility</b> by interfering with sperm function, e. g. through induction of premature acrosome reaction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mobile phones {{have become}} {{indispensable}} {{in the daily}} lives of men and women around the globe. As cell phone use has become more widespread, concerns have mounted regarding the potentially harmful effects of RF-EMR from these devices. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of RF-EMR from mobile phones on free radical metabolism and sperm quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male albino Wistar rats (10 - 12 weeks old) were exposed to RF-EMR from an active GSM (0. 9 / 1. 8 GHz) mobile phone for 1 hour continuously per day for 28 days. Controls were exposed to a mobile phone without a battery for the same period. The phone was kept in a cage with a wooden bottom in order to address concerns that the effects of exposure to the phone could be due to heat emitted by the phone rather than to RF-EMR alone. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last exposure and tissues of interest were harvested. RESULTS: One hour of exposure to the phone did not significantly change facial temperature in either group of rats. No significant difference was observed in total sperm count between controls and RF-EMR exposed groups. However, rats exposed to RF-EMR exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of motile sperm. Moreover, RF-EMR exposure resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and low GSH content in the testis and epididymis.

40|$|New {{developments}} in radiotherapy {{of patients with}} prostate cancer bear problems that are, according to current knowledge, only partially solved and of which the consequences are not foreseeable. First and foremost there is patient security with the major goal to minimize the rate of acute and late side effects while maintaining a high probability of tumour control probability. There are innumerable factors influencing these quality features. There are patent related factors {{which may not be}} influenced, factors of clinical quality management that may well be influenced and independent physical factors. To focus on those factors that may be influenced appears inevitable. Data from the literature as well as our own results convey the deceptive security to replace old rules and experiences when new techniques are introduced. For instance there is a threshold dose for the rectum with an increased risk of rectal bleeding when exceeding the dose beyond this threshold. In order to realize a dose escalation the problem of rectal dose minimization must have priority. The development of clinical and physical quality standards offers the possibilities to overcome this problem. One of those measures is image guided radiotherapy which allows for an increased precision of patient set-up by evaluating the patients’ position before each fraction, correcting it whenever necessary and applying treatment not before the set-up is correct. With this kind of improved precision safety margins encompassing the target may be reduced thus enabling a reduction of acute and late toxicity. One difficulty of comparing results of different workgroups are different concepts and clinical situations with regard to numerous therapy and ways of patient positioning and verification, respectively. In many cases procedures specific to a single department of variable quality are described without presenting details. To {{make a long story short}} – there is no standard available. For some work groups or departments an elaborate quality concept has been established, for others not. The checking in detail of quality measures and their influence on tumour control probability as well as normal tissue complication probability has constantly led to an improvement of the quality deficit bit by bit. Some parameters depend on others for instance the size of the CTV-PTV margin depends on the rectal filling status. Others show that small measures have a substantial impact on dose reduction to bladder and rectum, for instance the patient positioning with slightly bent hips and knees. It could be shown that significant rectal dose differences exist depending on the definition of rectal volumes. There are so far no unified rules and the dose guidelines always depend on the definition of the rectal volume. The comparison of literature based with regard to the maximum tolerable dose to the rectum should be used with caution. Dose constraints and expected toxicities are comparable only when the rectal volume is defined identically. One way out of this dilemma is the calculation of dose on absolute volumes (in Milliliters) which is independent of the organ contouring. Our work group could demonstrate that the dose to the bladder is depending on the size of the pros¬tate. The clinical relevance and the question if the increasing the dose to the bladder would translate into increased acute or late toxicities will be evaluated prospectively. This assumption seems logical and could lead to the clinical practice, that patients with an enlarged prostate gland and lower urinary tract symptoms will receive an appropriate therapy before initiation of radiotherapy. The measurement of the dose to the testicles during irradiation of prostate cancer patients has not been in the focus of quality management so far. Results from our studies show, that the level of radiation dose to the testicles <b>may</b> <b>impair</b> <b>fertility</b> as well as testosterone synthesis. Thus the relevance with regard to informed consent is obvious. The improvement of patient selection, optimization of technique in LDR- as well as HDR prostate cancer brachytherapy have resulted in a significant reduction of therapy-associated side effects. It is relevant that despite a high skill and experience of the treating physicians with different radiation therapy options, an improvement of single steps in the therapy processes were possible and future patients will benefit in the end. There is no standardization of the procedures in radiation oncology of prostate cancer so far. EORTC-guidelines for primary radiotherapy of prostate cancer are a means to communicate relevant aspects of quality management of prostate cancer patients. They are available for all radiation oncologists. An improvement of quality in radiotherapy was compatible with an evidence based medicine (on a high level) only partially in the past. Commonly new developments were not evaluated in phase III trials to prove an advance compared to the “standard”. On the other hand some of the developments demonstrated an improvement to such an extent that performing a phase III study might be considered unethical. It is hard to imagine for instance to prospectively evaluate the image guided and a non-image guided radiotherapy. In other areas new developments are used widely and over a long period of time without controlled studies although an obvious improvement was seen only in retrospective studies. As an example results from prospective trials of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy, a technique which showed its value since 1996 for many tumour sites, have been published for head and neck cancer in 2006. Phase III results for IMRT in prostate cancer are awaited. A uniform quality management in prostate cancer radiotherapy is still lacking. The number of publications dealing with this important aspect is rising constantly. Only uniform definitions of the different parameters in radiotherapy enable us in the future to compare results from different institutions. The preparation of guidelines for target volume definition, therapy preparation, patient set-up, und verification of therapy is a way to standardize prostate cancer radiotherapy across institutions and borders. Within our department the results of our studies have led to a change in the current clinical quality management. Processes from patient evaluation, therapy preparation, the course of therapy and regular treatment verification, respectively have been standardized and are adapted to new study results on a yearly basis. Our studies have also been included into the EORTC guideline of primary radiotherapy in prostate cancer...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the most}} {{appropriate}} measure of <b>impaired</b> <b>fertility</b> for understanding its social consequences in sub-Saharan Africa? The dearth of subjective measures in surveys in the region has prevented comparisons of subjective and objective measures. Perceived difficulties conceiving may have a greater impact than objective measures for social outcomes such as divorce, stigmatization and distress. This study compares 12 - (clinical) and 24 - (epidemiological) month measures from biomedicine and 5 - and 7 -year measures from demography with a subjective measure of <b>impaired</b> <b>fertility</b> using correlations, random effects models and test-retest models to assess relationships between measures, their association with sociodemographic characteristics and the stability of measures across time. Secondary panel data (1998 - 2004) from 1350 Ghanaian women aged 15 - 49 of all marital statuses are used. Longer waiting times to identification of <b>impaired</b> <b>fertility</b> required by demographic measures result in more stable measures, but perceived difficulties conceiving are most closely aligned with clinical infertility (r= 0. 61; p< 0. 05). Epidemiological infertility is also closely aligned with the subjective measure.
