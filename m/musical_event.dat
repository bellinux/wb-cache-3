40|$|Musical {{signals are}} highly structured. Untrained {{listeners}} can capture some particular <b>musical</b> <b>events</b> from audio signals. Uncovering this structure and detecting <b>musical</b> <b>events</b> will benefit <b>musical</b> content analysis. This {{is known to}} be an unsolved problem. In this paper, an unsupervised learning approach is proposed to automatically infer some structure of music from the segments generated by beat and onset analysis. A top-down clustering procedure is applied to group these segments into <b>musical</b> <b>events</b> with the similar characteristics. A Bayesian information criterion is then used to regularize the complexity of the model structure. Experimental results show that this unsupervised learning approach can effectively group similar segments together and automatically determine the number of such <b>musical</b> <b>events</b> in a given music piece. 1...|$|R

5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual <b>musical</b> <b>event</b> featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E
5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, {{and the record}} and film outlets available to him through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded <b>musical</b> <b>event,</b> mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
