500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the moment? And then think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing the air that I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? Why am I me? Why... why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that happens to <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|Fans ask <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{what it is}} like to be a rock star. I {{can tell}} that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E

500|$|Over the years, When Harry Met Sally... {{has become}} [...] "the quintessential {{contemporary}} feel-good relationship movie that somehow still rings true". Ephron still received letters from people {{obsessed with the}} film and still had [...] "people who say to <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> 'I was having a Harry-and-Sally relationship with him or her'." [...] The film is 23rd on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number60 on Bravo's [...] "100 Funniest Movies."

The film has inspired countless romantic comedies, including A Lot Like Love, Hum Tum and Definitely, Maybe. In addition, the film helped popularize many ideas about love that have become household concepts now, such as the [...] "" [...] girlfriend and the [...] "transitional person".|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Bow won {{an evening}} gown {{and a silver}} trophy, and the {{publisher}} committed to help her [...] "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to [...] "haunt" [...] Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until {{they came up with}} something. [...] "To get rid of me, or maybe they really meant to (give <b>me)</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. [...] "I was sick to my stomach," [...] she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business.|$|E
2500|$|The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, {{as there}} would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the {{designers}} used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said [...] "people ask <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> [...] "Why didn't you just use 3D?" [...] Well, that's easy to say now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back then you just didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate {{on a lot of}} the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D." [...] Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.|$|E
