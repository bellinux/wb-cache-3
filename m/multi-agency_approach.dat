40|$|In {{common with}} the {{experiences}} of many other groups – and despite changing legal landscapes and increasing recognition within social policy of different groups’ needs – LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans) people continue to face discrimination and abuse, and improving safety {{continues to be a}} key touchstone for policy makers and practitioners engaging with LGBT lives. Based on evidence from Count Me In Too, an LGBT participatory research project in Brighton & Hove, UK, the paper challenges approaches to dealing with LGBT safety that narrowly focus on reporting within a hate crime paradigm, and recognises the shift towards <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approaches</b> to LGBT safety. Our evidence shows that many LGBT people differentially recognise or do not recognise abuse, instead ‘normalising’ much of the abuse they experience in order to carry on with day-to-day life. By focusing on the effects of abuse and how it is dealt with by individuals and communities, rather than focusing on what constitutes abuse, we show the importance of addressing LGBT safety in ways that move beyond questions of criminal justice and the reporting of hate crime. We argue for a broader social policy framework that uses <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approaches</b> to community safety for those who experience abuse {{on the basis of their}} sexual and/or gender identities, which should attend to how safety services may provide more appropriate contexts of care and support, and which should build upon relevant knowledges within LGBT communities.

40|$|Several {{models of}} risk {{assessment}} {{for victims of}} domestic abuse have emerged in England, Wales, Scotland, Australia and the United States. In the United Kingdom, risk assessment and <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approaches</b> for very high-risk victims are {{a central part of}} the government's strategy to reduce domestic violence; therefore, risk assessment and management practices are proliferating rapidly. However, the feasibility and complexity of applying risk assessment to these areas is only just a beginning to be understood, particularly as risk assessment emerged from work with female victims and reflects knowledge of power and control differentials within heterosexual relationships. Using data from several empirical research projects, this paper compares the perceptions of safety and risk among female and male victims of domestic abuse (including heterosexual and gay victims). Differences in the prevalence of various risk factors are analysed across the different groups of victims. Implications for policy and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores eight professionals’ {{views on}} the use of the <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approach</b> to assist young people {{involved}} in violent and offending behaviour. Parallel to this overall purpose, this thesis also examines the professionals’ views on possible risk factors for the involvement in such behaviour, and their perception of possible improvements to this particular approach. As a result of the policy changes during the 90 ’s, multi agency approaches became a popular way to deal with crime. In recent years, new frameworks and programs for multi-agency approaches have been introduced. Focus on a more streamlined <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approach,</b> as a way of targeting young people involved in violent and offending behavior, has been implemented by sharing information and working together across agencies for the benefit of children and young people. The method of this thesis applied semi-structured interviews, all of them with 13 prepared questions, to obtain the data necessary, and used snowball sampling to expand the network of informants. The results showed that most agencies saw benefits with the <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approach</b> primarily because of the way in which one can better obtain the needs of the child/youth and accommodate these on different levels thanks to the close interaction of the agencies. Moreover, the informants displayed a unified understanding of the underlying risk factors that might contribute to the involvement in violent or offending behaviour. Primarily, the informants addressed five risk factor themes: family, drugs and alcohol, gang culture and peer pressure, deprivation, and education. As for improvements, the informants saw the biggest need for such in the area of communication, not only between agencies, but also on a societal and political level where social issues must be addressed in policy making and resource funding. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 the Home Office {{set up an}} {{initiative}} to engage Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) across England and Wales in exploring how local partnership working {{could be used to}} more effectively tackle organised crime. This report presents the main findings from a process evaluation undertaken of the 12 pilot sites included in this initiative. Our understanding of what works in relation to tackling organised crime is limited to a handful of studies focused on police-based responses to particular aspects of organised crime (e. g. people trafficking). However, the range of activity committed by organised criminals is extensive and the effects are dealt with by a range of local and national level partners and organisations.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to report the {{findings}} from research into the governance of adult protection in Scotland, with particular focus on the outcomes of provision for multi-agency leadership and management of adult safeguarding in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007. Comparisons will be drawn between these findings and the evidence on the governance of adult safeguarding in England. Design/methodology/approach – The study comprised a thematic analysis of Adult Protection Committee (APC) biennial reports on implementation of the 2007 Act to the Scottish Government, associated documentation, and key informant interviews with professionals involved in adult protection leadership and practice. Findings – A rich and complex pattern of arrangements, activities, experiences and challenges were identified across a number of dimensions, including management structures of APCs, development of policies and procedures, multi-agency working, training, performance assessment and quality management, engagement of service users and carers and operation of the 2007 Act.

40|$|UK {{policy and}} {{practice}} endorses family support for child well-being. Achieving such support requires <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approaches,</b> that consider all aspects of parents’ and children’s lives and which offer practical, social and emotional help. The potential for services to make {{a positive impact on}} parents and their families will depend in part on the level and nature of engagement. In this paper a case is made for the application of the two-part ‘surface and depth’ concept for understanding how practitioners engage with families and how they might improve the chances of supporting sustainable differences for parents and families. To illustrate, qualitative data from a review of family centre support provided by a north of England local authority, are presented. The review was commissioned to explore why families often need to re-engage with intensive support services. Data are drawn from interviews with parents (n= 18, recruited following a survey of all those registered with the service during April – May 2009) and discussions with family centre support workers (n= 4) and following thematic analysis three dominant themes emerged: ‘resources available’, ‘staff approach’ and ‘real life’, were appraised in light of the ‘surface and depth’ concept. Much of the work with parents effectively dealt with pressing needs. This felt gratifying for both parent and worker and supported immediate service engagement. However, each noted that the more complex issues in parents’ lives went unchallenged and thus the sustainability of progress in terms of parenting practice was questionable. A ‘strengths focused’ approach by staff, that understood needs in the context of parents’ ‘real life’ circumstances was important to parent engagement. Thus, longer term benefits from family support requires practitioners to work with parents to problem solve immediate issues whilst also digging deeper to acknowledge and seek to resolve the more complex challenges parents face in their real lives...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} study explores multi-agency {{working practices}} in three English children's centres. The study highlights {{the experiences and}} values of professionals working in the children's centres, {{in relation to the}} construction of collaborative working practices, to engage with children, families and the local community. I have adopted a narrative approach to my research by drawing on principles and practices from narrative therapy, as well as approaches from qualitative, action and practitioner research. A reflecting team approach was used to develop, reflect on and reconstruct narratives of successful professional practice. These narratives of success incorporate collaborative working practices, overcoming difficulties and future possibilities. The reflecting team conversations were audio recorded and subsequently transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to generate the main themes from the narratives. Two interlocking thematic networks were developed to represent identified themes and their interconnectedness. The analysis indicates that overarching beliefs and assumptions related to multi-agency work directly influence the process, achievements and enablers of collaboration. Activity theory is utilised to represent the development and mobilisation of knowledge within the children's centres, as well as my own knowledge development as a narrative researcher and practitioner. The findings of the study identify that the development and storying of local knowledge facilitates multi-agency understandings and practices, involving individuals, groups and organisations working together on a joint initiative. The narratives of success reveal implications for regional and national practice in the development of <b>multi-agency</b> <b>approaches,</b> particularly in Children's Services. The adoption of a narrative approach, and the use of a reflecting team as a qualitative research tool, is considered in the context of social constructionist theory and research.
