25|$|In linear regression, the {{relationships}} are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of y given {{the value of}} X {{is assumed to be}} an affine function of X; less commonly, the median or some other quantile of the conditional distribution of y given X is expressed as a linear function of X. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on the joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis.</b> A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakthrough}} in nano-FTIR {{came upon the}} development of high-power broadband mid-IR laser sources, which provided large spectral irradiance in a sufficiently large bandwidth (mW-level power in ~1000cm-1 bandwidth) and enabled truly broadband nanoscale-resolved material spectroscopy capable of detecting even the weakest vibrational resonances. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with far-field FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> – a widely used tool for heterogeneous sample analysis.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. <b>Multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|The eigendecomposition of a {{symmetric}} positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal {{basis of}} eigenvectors, {{each of which}} has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis,</b> where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal components analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthonormal eigen-basis for the space of the observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.|$|E

2500|$|Behavior {{problems}} are a {{primary cause of}} cats being relinquished to shelters. [...] Proponents of declawing argue that declawing reduces undesired behaviors (scratching) and thus reduces the likelihood of relinquishment. [...] Opponents of declawing argue the surgery itself creates more behavioral problems leading to relinquishment of cats. A study by Patronek et al. (1996) found in a univariate analysis that declawed cats were only 63% {{as likely to be}} relinquished as non-declawed cats. [...] A <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> conducted in the same study shows odds of being relinquished to a shelter were 89% higher for declawed cats. [...] The authors concluded that the conflicting results of the two analysis made it difficult to interpret the effects of declawing.

[...] However, this study ultimately found no association between the declaw status of cats and their aggression towards humans or frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).|$|E
