500|$|The castle {{began to}} deteriorate, and the {{antiquarian}} John Britton noted {{during his visit}} in 1813 {{that it had been}} [...] "abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin: the glass is destroyed, the ceilings and floors are falling, and the rains streams through the opening roof on the damp and <b>mouldering</b> walls". The smithy {{in the basement of the}} south tower resulted in a fire in 1830, which caused considerable damage to the castle, gutting the south tower. Extensive decay in the bases of the cruck tresses in the castle's roof posed a particular threat to the hall, as the decaying roof began to push the walls apart.|$|E
500|$|The {{decline of}} the {{settlement}} led to the {{decline of the}} church. In 1776 Thomas Philipot described it as [...] "full of solitude, and languished into decay". In 1787 John Pridden noticed that the roofline of the nave must have been lowered at some time, judging by the tops of the east and west walls, {{and the fact that the}} tops of the two windows over the west door were at that time filled in with brick; he also noted that the roof had been repaired in 1775 by A. Sayer, churchwarden, these details appearing embossed on replacement lead. But he described the church as [...] "a weather-beaten building... <b>mouldering</b> away by the fury of the elements", and a letter to The Gentleman's Magazine in 1809 said that it was then somewhat dilapidated, with [...] "trifling... repairs such as have only tended to obliterate its once-harmonizing beauties." ...|$|E

50|$|Wood <b>moulders</b> {{almost always}} have the {{capacity}} to serve as a wood planer as well. For this reason they are also known as Planer/ <b>Moulders.</b> However, a wood planer does not necessarily have the capability to be a <b>moulder.</b> There are several makes and models of both planers and planer/ <b>moulders</b> on the market.|$|R

50|$|A {{log house}} <b>moulder</b> is a machine to prepare logs to be {{suitable}} for building a log home. In general, the logs are first sawn to a square beam, then the <b>moulder</b> makes the groove. Often fitted to a portable sawmill that enables direct profiling of round or squared logs. The log house <b>moulder</b> is usually powered by electricity, but for portable sawmills they are sometimes using a chainsaw as power head. One of the more common, especially in Europe, is theLogosol log house <b>moulder.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Moulder's</b> musical career {{started in}} the early 1980s, at Trident Studios in London. As an {{assistant}} engineer, he worked with influential producers like Jean Michel Jarre, drawing from them great familiarity with electronic sounds and textures. Also an engineer at Trident was Flood with whom <b>Moulder</b> would often collaborate in the future. <b>Moulder</b> assisted in one of Flood's recording sessions with The Jesus and Mary Chain, {{and found that the}} often fractious and troublesome band enjoyed working with him. The Mary Chain invited <b>Moulder</b> to engineer their live sounds and, eventually, to engineer their 1989 album Automatic. The album's production was praised for its combination of thick, noisy guitar with a polished, listener-friendly tone, and the Mary Chain's former label, Creation Records, soon had <b>Moulder</b> producing records for Ride, My Bloody Valentine and Swervedriver.|$|R

5000|$|Other type of {{log house}} <b>moulder</b> is a log through-pass machine. Through-pass log home <b>moulders</b> are highly {{productive}} and mighty machines {{able to turn}} truck load of logs into house logs during a work shift. Barked or debarked green or dry logs are fed into such machine one after other {{on one side and}} the machine processes logs, turning them into profiled roundish or squarish house logs, taken from outfeed of the machine. Such log home milling machine can shape logs into different profiles: Swedish cope, Tongue&groove, D-log, bevel-edged logs, etc.One of <b>moulders</b> of through-pass type are Woodlandia' Rotary Log <b>Moulders</b> (USA, Canada, Russia) ...|$|R

Harrison also stole 3 bases in the game. For <b>Moulder,</b> it was his 9th multi-homer game of the season< a school record. [...] Harrison and <b>Moulder</b> are also tied for the longest home run at Bearkats Stadium. In 1998 Harrison blasted a shot 437 ft.

50|$|Robin <b>Moulder</b> grew up {{with one}} sister Helen <b>Moulder</b> and two {{brothers}} Dave and Al <b>Moulder.</b> <b>Moulder</b> began studying music on trumpet and piano and initially didn't envision a musical career for herself. She received a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Her first job out of college took her to Florida. She began playing keyboard for a live band, and moved to bass {{to fill the void}} left by a departing bandmate. She quickly discovered an aptitude for the instrument, and began looking for other people who shared her outlook on music. She found them in Tenni Ah-Cha-Cha, Jessicka Fodera, and Michelle Inhell, and the four of them created Jack Off Jill.|$|R
50|$|A wood <b>moulder</b> has {{one or more}} {{horizontal}} cutter heads, and {{may also}} have side cutter heads. Because it has horizontal cutter heads a wood <b>moulder</b> differs from a spindle shaper, which has one or sometimes more vertical spindles and no horizontal heads.|$|R

50|$|A wood <b>moulder</b> is {{a machine}} used to shape wood with {{profiled}} cutters. The profiled cutters are {{also known as}} knives, and blades.
