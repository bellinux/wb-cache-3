40|$|This study uses a <b>metal</b> <b>stud</b> <b>partition</b> {{fireproof}} drywall measuring 83 [*]mm in thickness as a {{test specimen}} to explore the impact of an embedded junction box on the firefighting performance of the wall through one time of standard fire test on a 300 [*]cm × 300 [*]cm area and five times of standard fire test on a 120 [*]cm × 120 [*]cm area. The {{results show that the}} quality of calcium silicate board plays a big role in the fireproof effectiveness. The embedded junction box located on the backside of the fire can reduce the effectiveness of the wall, especially the area above the socket. The thickness of rock wool may increase the performance, but in a limited rate. External junction box may not impact the fireproofing performance of the wall but it still possesses some safety risks. An embedded junction box measuring 101 × 55 [*]mm could already damage the fire compartment, and in reality there may be more complicated situations that should be noted and improved...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Metal</b> <b>Studs</b> - The contestants, after {{a lesson}} on how to build using <b>metal</b> <b>studs,</b> must build a wall using these studs. However, during the lesson, one key portion was omitted: the detail on how to attach a {{strengthening}} channel to the wall. Despite this, all of the contestants easily determine how the strengthening channel is to be installed (cutting it too long, bending the excess up, and screwing it in place). Despite some minor difficulties in aligning {{the holes in the}} studs for the channel as well as attaching the stud wall to the room's walls, all of them eventually pass.|$|R

5000|$|Roll forming {{machines}} are available that produce shapes {{of different sizes}} and material thicknesses using the same rolls. Variations in size are achieved by making the distances between the rolls variable by manual adjustment or computerized controls, allowing for rapid changeover. These specialized mills are prevalent in the light gauge framing industry where <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> and tracks of standardized profiles and thicknesses are used. For example, a single mill {{may be able to}} produce <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> of different web (e.g. 3-5/8" [...] to 14 inches), flange (e.g. 1-3/8" [...] to 2-1/2") and lip (e.g. 3/8" [...] to 5/8") dimensions, from different gauges (e.g. 20 to 12 GA) of galvanized steel sheet.|$|R

5000|$|In {{mountain}} biking (MTB) and BMX, platform pedals typically refer to any flat pedal without a cage. BMX riders typically use plastic pedals made of nylon, polycarbonate, or carbon reinforced plastic, although aluminum alloy, and magnesium {{are not uncommon}} pedal body materials. Mountain bikers tend to use aluminum or magnesium because of the necessary use of <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> to offer grip while the pedals are wet, muddy and slippery. BMX'ers tend to prefer platforms to cage pedals because they offer more support and grip for flexible [...] "skate" [...] shoes by using short <b>metal</b> <b>studs.</b> Cage pedals are more popular in the low end mountain bike range. In general, cage pedals are uncommon in all types of biking, {{although there is a}} niche market within {{mountain biking}}.|$|R

2500|$|Tires vary {{enormously}} {{depending on}} their intended purpose. Road bicycles use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or slick, and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces.

The suspect carried three weapons, including a semi-automatic carbine.|$|R

5000|$|Adding {{one layer}} of Acoustiblok to a {{standard}} <b>metal</b> <b>stud</b> gypsum board interior wall, increases its STC to 53, which exceeds that of a 8" [...] poured concrete slab, STC 51.
