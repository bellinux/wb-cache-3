40|$|IntroductionIn a {{previous}} study of prognostic factors in patients with loco-regionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus treated with chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) followed by resection, we found that <b>residual</b> nodal <b>disease</b> was most prognostic of outcome. In this study, we evaluated prognostic factors among patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus who have undergone a similar treatment regimen. MethodsA retrospective review of patients with SCC of the esophagus who received CRT before esophagectomy. Data collected included demographics, CRT details, pathologic findings, and survival. Statistical methods included recursive partitioning and Kaplan-Meier analyses. ResultsFrom 1996 to 2006, 91 patients were appropriate for this analysis. Complete pathologic response in the primary tumor (pt-pCR) occurred in 49 patients (53. 8 %), including 10 of 91 (10. 9 %) who had a pt-pCR but <b>residual</b> nodal <b>disease.</b> Recursive partitioning analysis identified three prognostic groups: (1) group 1 (n = 52), patients with <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> local <b>disease</b> (pt-pCR and T 1 -N any); (2) group 2 (n = 28), patients with <b>residual</b> T 2 <b>disease</b> (N 0 and N 1) and patients with T 3 - 4 N 0 disease; and (3) group 3 (n = 11), patients with residual T 3 - 4 N 1 disease. Three-year survival was 68. 4 % in group 1, 45. 6 % in group 2, and 0 % in group 3 (p < 0. 001). ConclusionsUnlike adenocarcinoma, in which <b>residual</b> nodal <b>disease</b> after CRT {{is the most significant}} predictor of survival, in SCC of the esophagus, pt-pCR or <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> local <b>disease</b> after CRT predicts the best survival.

In our study we focused on detection of MRD in neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is one of the peripheral neuroblastic tumors (pNTs) that accounts approximately for 10 percent of all childhood cancers. The question raised however not answered until this day is whether evidence of MRD in bone marrow may be used as independent prognostic factor in diagnosis of neuroblastoma. Furthermore, it is important to establish what kind of testing technique should be used and what values to look at. There exist various methodologies in detection of MRD evidence in neuroblastoma. These methods differ in cost and complexity, but mainly some of them are more specific and sensitive than the other. Cancer cells may be detected in the blood as well as in the bone marrow. Very often it is the bone marrow that is affected by the metastasis in neuroblastoma, therefore 85 % of all high risk neuroblastomas show positive results in the standard cytomorphology tests of bone marrow.

40|$|Phenotypic and {{genotypic}} {{analyses of}} cells are increasingly essential for understanding pathogenetic mechanisms {{as well as}} for diagnosing and classifying malignancies and other diseases. We report a novel multicolor approach based on the FICTION (fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms) technique, which enables the simultaneous detection of morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of single cells. As prerequisite, multicolor interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization assays for B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma have been developed. These assays allow the simultaneous detection of the most frequent primary chromosomal aberrations in these neoplasms, such as t(8; 14), t(11; 14), t(14; 18), and t(3; 14), and the various rearrangements of the ALK gene, respectively. To establish the multicolor FICTION technique, these assays were combined with the immunophenotypic detection of lineage- or tumor-specific antigens, namely CD 20 and ALK, respectively. For evaluation of multicolor FICTION experiments, image acquisition was performed by automatic sequential capturing of multiple focal planes. Thus, three-dimensional information was obtained. The multicolor FICTION assays were applied to well-characterized lymphoma samples, proving the performance, validity, and diagnostic power of the technique.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} possible impact of routinely scheduled biopsies and more radical surgery for <b>residual</b> central <b>disease</b> in locally advanced cervical cancer after (chemo) radiation. Methods/Materials: Data were analyzed of a consecutive series of cervical cancer patients (The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IB 1 -IVA) treated with (chemo) radiation between 1994 and 2011. Patients underwent gynecologic examination with biopsies 8 to 10 weeks after treatment. Since 2001, larger biopsies by electric loop excision were taken, and more radical surgery (type III hysterectomy or exenteration) was performed for central <b>residual</b> <b>disease.</b> Primary outcome was locoregional recurrence. Secondary outcomes were treatment-associated morbidity and disease-specific survival. Results: Primary (chemo) radiation was given to 491 cervical cancer patients; 345 patients had a posttreatment biopsy. Viable tumor cells were identified in 84 patients, and 61 patients were eligible for salvage surgery. <b>Residual</b> <b>disease</b> after (chemo) radiation was an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 3. 59; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 18 - 5. 93; P < 0. 001). After 2001, larger biopsies were more frequently taken (29 % vs 76 %, P < 0. 001), and in patients without viable tumor cells, locoregional recurrence after 2001 decreased from 21 % to 10 % (P = 0. 01). After 2001, more patients underwent more radical surgery (46 % vs 90 %) (P < 0. 001). Locoregional recurrence after surgery before 2001 occurred in 6 (46 %) of the 13 patients, comparable with 19 (40 %) of the 48 (P = 0. 67) after 2001. More radical surgery was not associated with improved disease-specific survival (HR, 0. 84; 95 % CI, 0. 20 - 3. 46; P = 0. 81) but did result in significantly more severe morbidity.

40|$|Important {{consideration}} in development of effective radiotherapy {{is the nature}} of the radiation emitted by the radionuclide.

50|$|Cancer {{dormancy}} is not {{yet fully}} understood, but some researchers have performed mathematical modeling to explain the occurrence of cancer dormancy as a characteristic of all migrating tumor cells {{as part of an}} evolutionary process of selection and mutation. Recently, scientists from Aga Khan University Pakistan, have extended the studies of encystation in Acanthamoeba to induce dormancy in Prostate cancer cells lines and understanding of the signalling pathways that are involved. This eukaryotic encystation in Acanthamoeba spp., is known to involve a crosstalk between the trophozoite form of the cell and unfavourable microenvoirment that induces it. It is thought that once tumor cells disseminate and begin to migrate to a new site to metastasize, the interaction of the tumor cells with that microenvironment determines whether the cells will proliferate and form metastases or undergo growth arrest and enter cancer dormancy. It is suggested that the disseminated cells choose dormancy when the new environment is not permissive in situations such as cellular stress or a lack of available growth factors. These dormant cells can stay in this state {{for long periods of time}} and can be clinically undetectable. However, these cells can be dangerous because they can strike back years after the doctor and patient believe the patient is cured. They can exist in a quiescent state for many years, but the dormancy period can be interrupted to start proliferating uncontrollably and form metastases that cannot be treated. Cancer dormancy is often associated with <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> <b>disease</b> (MRD) where some tumor cells are left behind after a treatment and can persist either at the primary tumor site or as disseminated cells that are proliferating or dormant. MRD has been found in a widespread range of cancers including but not limited to: breast, prostate, colon, gastric, colon, pancreatic, head and neck, neuroblastoma, leukemia, melanoma, and others. These cells are often found in the bone marrow, but are also found in other organs and usually indicate poor prognosis for the patient.|$|E

Of 113 patients {{with at least one}} <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> <b>disease</b> sample, RQ-PCR was applicable in 97 (86 %). A total of 284 <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> <b>disease</b> samples from 61 patients were analyzed in parallel by flow cytometry and RQ-PCR. A single, 8 -color, 10 -antibody flow cytometry tube allowed specific <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> <b>disease</b> assessment in all patients, with a robust sensitivity of 0. 01 %. Using this cut-off level, the true-positive-rate of flow cytometry with respect to RQ-PCR was 80 %, whereas the true-negative-rate was 92 %. As expected, RQ-PCR frequently detected positivity below this 0. 01 % threshold, which is insufficiently sensitive for prognostic evaluation and would ideally be replaced with robust quantification down to a 0. 001 % (10 - 5) threshold. In 10 relapsing patients, the transition from negative to positive by RQ-PCR (median 22. 5 months before relapse) nearly always preceded transition by flow cytometry (4. 5 months), but transition to RQ-PCR positivity above 0. 01 % (5 months) was simultaneous.

40|$|Abstract The European Hematology Association (EHA) Roadmap for European Hematology Research {{highlights}} major {{achievements in}} {{diagnosis and treatment}} of blood disorders and identifies the greatest unmet clinical and scientific needs in those areas to enable better funded, more focused European hematology research. Initiated by the EHA, around 300 experts contributed to the consensus document, which will help European policy makers, research funders, research organizations, researchers, and patient groups make better informed decisions on hematology research. It also aims to raise public awareness of the burden of blood disorders on European society, which purely in economic terms is estimated at Euro 23 billion per year, a level of cost that is not matched in current European hematology research funding. In recent decades, hematology research has improved our fundamental understanding of the biology of blood disorders, and has improved diagnostics and treatments, sometimes in revolutionary ways. This progress highlights the potential of focused basic research programs such as this EHA Roadmap. The EHA Roadmap identifies nine sections in hematology: normal hematopoiesis, malignant lymphoid and myeloid diseases, anemias and related diseases, platelet disorders, blood coagulation and hemostatic disorders, transfusion medicine, infections in hematology, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These sections span 60 smaller groups of diseases or disorders. The EHA Roadmap identifies priorities and needs across the field of hematology, including those to develop targeted therapies based on genomic profiling and chemical biology, to eradicate <b>minimal</b> <b>residual</b> malignant <b>disease,</b> and to develop cellular immunotherapies, combination treatments, gene therapies, hematopoietic stem cell treatments, and treatments that are better tolerated by elderly patients.
