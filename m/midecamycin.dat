40|$|Abstract Two subclusters from Streptomyces mycarofaciens, a <b>midecamycin</b> producer, were cloned and {{partially}} sequenced. One region was {{located at the}} 5 ' end of the mid polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and contained the genes midA, midB and midC. The other region was at the 3 ' end of the PKS genes and contained midK, midI and midH. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that these genes encode dTDP-glucose synthase (midA), dTDP-glucose dehydratase (midB), aminotransferase (midC), methyltransferase (midK), glycosyltransferase (midI) and an assistant gene (midH). All of these genes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of dTDP-D-mycaminose, the first deoxysugar of <b>midecamycin,</b> and in transferring the mycaminose to the <b>midecamycin</b> aglycone in S. mycarofaciens. Similar to gene pairs desVIII/desVII in S. venezuelae and tylMIII/tylMII in S. fradiae, the product of midH probably functions as an auxiliary protein required by the MidI protein for efficient glycosyltransfer in <b>midecamycin</b> biosynthesis.

The method of investigation consisted of intraluminal pressure measurements in the gastric antrum and upper small intestine by means of a low compliance perfused catheter system. Eleven healthy volunteers participated in the single blind, placebo-controlled study of both interdigestive and postprandial gastrointestinal motility. Azithromycin was administered by mouth in a single 500 mg dose or in two daily doses of 250 mg; <b>midecamycin</b> acetate was given in a dose of 600 mg b. i. d. The effect of <b>midecamycin</b> acetate on gastric antral and jejunal motility was not significantly different from that of placebo. This was true for both the interdigestive and the postprandial phases of gastrointestinal motility. Peroral treatment with azithromycin resulted in a statistically significant increase in the postprandial antral motility index as compared to placebo.

40|$|Ryanodine {{receptor}} (RyR) Ca 2 + {{channels in}} the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle are {{regulated by the}} 12 kDa FK 506 - (or rapamycin-) binding protein (FKBP 12). Rapamycin can also activate RyR channels with FKBP 12 removed, suggesting that compounds with macrocyclic lactone ring structures can directly activate RyRs. Here we tested this hypothesis using two other macrocyclic lactone compounds, ivermectin and <b>midecamycin.</b> Rabbit skeletal RyRs were examined in lipid bilayers. Ivermectin (cis, 0. 66 – 40 μm) activated six of eight native, four of four control-incubated and eleven of eleven FKBP 12 -‘stripped’ RyR channels. <b>Midecamycin</b> (cis, 10 – 30 μm) activated three of four single native channels, six of eight control-incubated channels and six of seven FKBP 12 -stripped channels. Activity declined when either drug was washed out. Neither ivermectin nor <b>midecamycin</b> removed FKBP 12 from RyRs. Western blots of terminal cisternae (TC), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 40 μm ivermectin or <b>midecamycin,</b> showed normal amounts of FKBP 12. In contrast, no FKBP 12 was detected after incubation with 40 μm rapamycin. Ivermectin reduced Ca 2 + uptake by the SR Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-ATPase. Ca 2 + uptake by TC fell to ∼ 40 % {{in the presence of}} ivermectin (10 μm), both with and without 10 μm Ruthenium Red. Ca 2 + uptake by longitudinal SR also fell to ∼ 40 % with 10 μm ivermectin. <b>Midecamycin</b> (10 μm) reduced Ca 2 + uptake by TC vesicles to ∼ 76 % without Ruthenium Red and to ∼ 90 % with Ruthenium Red. The rate of rise of extravesicular [Ca 2 +] increased ∼ 2 -fold when 10 μm ivermectin was added to TC vesicles that had been partially loaded with Ca 2 + and then Ca 2 + uptake blocked by 200 nm thapsigargin. Ivermectin also potentiated caffeine-induced Ca 2 + release to ∼ 140 % of control. These increases in Ca 2 + release were not seen with <b>midecamycin.</b> Ivermectin, but not <b>midecamycin,</b> reversibly reduced Ca 2 + loading in four of six skinned rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibres to ∼ 90 %, and reversibly increased submaximal caffeine-induced contraction in five of eight fibres by ∼ 110 % of control. Neither ivermectin nor <b>midecamycin</b> altered twitch or tetanic tension in intact EDL muscle fibres within 20 min of drug addition. The results confirm the hypothesis that compounds with a macrocyclic lactone ring structure can directly activate RyRs. Unexpectedly, ivermectin also reduced Ca 2 + uptake into the SR. These effects of ivermectin on SR Ca 2 + handling may explain some effects of the macrolide drugs on mammals...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{compare the}} in vitro {{activity}} of <b>midecamycin</b> diacetate {{to that of}} five other macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, and josamycin) and of clindamycin against 146 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, with regard to three different phenotypes of erythromycin resistance. MethodsSusceptibility pattern and resistance phenotype were determined by disk diffusion method and double disk test. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were obtained by the agar dilution method and evaluated according to {{the recommendations of the}} ‘Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie’ (CA-SFM). The major determinants of erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes (ermB, ermTR and mefA genes) were investigated by specific amplification protocols. ResultsMost of the isolates of S. pyogenes collected during 1995 — 99 were susceptible to <b>midecamycin</b> (93. 8 %), erythromycin (90. 4 %), clarithromycin (93. 2 %), roxithromycin (91. 8 %), azithromycin (88. 4 %), josamycin (94. 5 %), and clindamycin (94. 5 %). According to the CA-SFM criteria, 132 of the 146 isolates studied were susceptible to erythromycin (MICs ≤ 1 mg/L), four were intermediate (MICs 2 – 4 mg/L), and 10 were resistant (MICs > 4 mg/L). Only nine isolates were <b>midecamycin</b> resistant (MICs > 4 mg/L), and the others were susceptible. The increased activity of <b>midecamycin</b> (MIC 90 < 0. 06 mg/L), as compared to erythromycin (MIC 90 = 0. 5 mg/L) and to other 14 - or 15 -membered macrolides, was related to the absence of the ermB determinant in seven isolates which displayed an efflux phenotype (five isolates) or an inducible resistance phenotype due to an ermTR determinant (two isolates). ConclusionMidecamycin diacetate is active against most S. pyogenes strains isolated in France and may represent an attractive alternative to the treatment of streptococcal infections due to resistant isolates with efflux of erythromycin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect was}} studied on {{gastrointestinal}} motor activity {{of three different}} macrolides (erythromycin, roxithromycin and <b>midecamycin</b> acetate), administered by mouth in therapeutic doses. This placebo-controlled study was performed in 12 normal human subjects by means of intraluminal pressure measurements in the gastric antrum, duodenum and upper jejunum. In each subject, three manometries were done for 5 h in the interdigestive period and for 3 h postprandially. In the interdigestive period, <b>midecamycin</b> acetate {{did not affect the}} characteristics of the gastric migrating motor complex (MMC) and did not increase the number of antral contractions or the gastric motility index as compared to the placebo. Erythromycin and roxithromycin increased the number of antral contractions (24. 5 +/- 11 versus 15. 2 +/- 7 and 28. 4 +/- 12 versus 14. 9 +/- 5. 9 respectively) and the motility index (4. 05 +/- 0. 5 versus 3. 17 +/- 0. 6 and 4. 38 +/- 0. 2. versus 3. 64 +/- 0. 7 respectively) as compared to the placebo. In the postprandial period, the number of antral contractions was not significantly increased by any of the three antibiotics. The postprandial antral motility index was not significantly increased by <b>midecamycin</b> acetate. In contrast, the postprandial antral motility indexes after erythromycin (4. 4 +/- 0. 5) and after roxithromycin (4. 3 +/- 0. 2) were significantly greater than after the placebo. In the upper small intestine, erythromycin elicited an increased number of phase-III-like activity events and roxithromycin shortened the MMC cycle length. <b>Midecamycin</b> acetate had no effect on interdigestive upper jejunal motility.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{macrolide}} antibiotics, <b>midecamycin</b> acetate, josamycin, and clarithromycin, on human T-cell function {{was investigated in}} vitro. <b>Midecamycin</b> acetate and josamycin suppressed the proliferative response of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} stimulated by polyclonal T-cell mitogens at concentrations between 1. 6 and 8 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations (40 to 200 micrograms/ml), all these drugs showed a marked inhibitory effect. At concentrations of 1. 6 to 40 micrograms/ml, these drugs suppressed interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production induced by mitogen-stimulated T cells, but not the expression of IL- 2 receptor (CD 25), in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the suppressive action on T-lymphocyte proliferation seems {{to be based on the}} ability of these drugs to inhibit IL- 2 production by T cells. The drug also inhibited mixed lymphocyte reaction at the same concentrations. Combined treatment with these macrolides and the known immunosuppressants such as FK 506 and cyclosporin A resulted in an increased inhibition of T-cell proliferation.

40|$|It {{has proved}} {{difficult}} {{to develop a}} standard method for the determination of mini-mum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics against the Legionellaceae. A major obstacle has been the inactivation of certain antibiotics by components of Charcoal Yeast Extract agar, especially charcoal. To determine the MICs of eight macrolides and related agents (erythromycin, spiramycin, oleandomycin, josamycin, <b>midecamycin,</b> lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin) for 36 strains of Legionella, we used two charcoal-free media. Buffered Yeast Extract agar and Buffered Antibiotic Medium no. 1 (BAM,), the latter having been developed in our own laboratory.

Ca. 10 kb DNA aus Cosmid Smyc-LC 1 und ca. 7 kb DNA aus Smyc-LC 3 wurden komplett sequenziert. Die übrigen Regionen wurden durch {{partielle}} Sequenzierung charakterisiert, um weitere Informationen über Struktur und Genverteilung zu erhalten. Unter den Genen wurden 10 komplette und 14 unvollständige Leserahmen identifiziert, die für die Midecamycin-Biosynthese notwendig sind. Die Region der Mycarose-Biosynthesegene wurde auf Smyc-LC 1 gefunden. Das komplette Set der Gene für Biosynthese und Transfer der Mycaminose wurde kloniert. Die Organisation des mid Genclusters ist ähnlich wie in andern Makroliden zu beiden Seiten der zentralen PKS Gene mit zwei gemischten Gruppen von Zucker-, Acylierungs-, Resistenz- und Regulatorgenen strukturiert. Die Genen, midC, midH, midK und midI, wurden durch heterologe Expression charakterisiert. MidC und MidH wurden als lösliche Proteine in E. coli überproduziert, jeweils in nativer und His-tag fusionierter Primärstruktur. Die ebenfalls löslichen His-tag Proteine MidK und MidI wurden nur in geringer Menge gebildet und über Westernblot nachgewiesen. Um die postulierten Funktionen der MidH (3, 4 -Isomerase) und MidC (3 -Aminotransferase) nachzuweisen, wurden die Produkte eines gekoppelten Enzymtests zur Umsetzung von dTDP-D-Glucose mit RmlB (4, 6 -Dehydratase), MidH und MidC mittles HPLC und LC-MS Techniken ausgewertet.

In {{this study}} the following aspects have {{been worked out}} by studying the genetics of <b>midecamycin</b> biosynthesis as a model system to elucidate the biosynthesis of sugar components in 16 -membered macrolides and to acquire tools {{for the production of}} new hybrid macrolide antibiotics. By sequentially screening a genomic library in the cosmid vector pKU 206 via two homologous gene probes which were detected by PCR, the <b>midecamycin</b> biosynthetic (mid) gene cluster has been identified in the isolated ca. 74 kb DNA in the genome of S. mycarofaciens, falling into two regions. About 10 kb DNA from the cosmid Smyc-LC 1 and ca. 7 kb DNA from the cosmid Smyc-LC 3 were sequenced contiguously. The remaining regions of these two cosmids were partially sequenced to get further information on extension and informational contents of the cluster. Among them, 10 genes with complete reading frames and 14 genes incomplete were identified, all of which are necessary for <b>midecamycin</b> biosynthesis. The region of genes responsible for mycarose biosynthesis was found in Smyc-LC 1. A complete set of genes for the biosynthesis and transfer of mycaminose was identified. The organisation of the overall mid gene cluster revealed that, similar to other macrolide gene clusters, the PKS genes are flanked by two regions containing genes encoding enzymes for sugar biosynthesis, with others for resistance, regulatory, and sugar or lactone modification. The genes, midC, midH, midK and midI, were characterised by heterologous expression of these enzymes. MidC and MidH were over-produced as soluble proteins in E. coli both in native form and as His-tag fusion. Soluble proteins His-tag-MidK and His-tag-MidI were detected only by Western blotting in low quantities. To characterise the postulated function of MidH (3, 4 -isomerase) and MidC (3 -aminotransferase), the products of a coupling enzymatic reaction to convert dTDP-D-glucose by RmlB (4, 6 -dehydratase), MidH and MidC were analysed by HPLC and LC-MS.

To evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of erythromycin, we examined the survival of isolated neutrophils with and without erythromycin. Erythromycin shortened neutrophil survival in a dose-dependent fashion, with a maximum effect at 10 micrograms/ml [corrected] and above. Survival at 24 h was 63. 4 % in medium with 10 micrograms of erythromycin per ml compared with 82. 7 % in control medium (P < 0. 01). This shortening of survival was brought about by acceleration of apoptosis, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. In a manner similar to that of erythromycin, other macrolide antibiotics, i. e., clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and <b>midecamycin,</b> also shortened neutrophil survival, but neither the beta-lactams ampicillin and cefazolin nor the aminoglycoside gentamicin affected their survival.

Based on phenotypic characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, all isolates were identified as A. veronii. These results indicate that the microbiological risk posed by A. veronii is considerable for channel catfish cultured in Southwestern China. Susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. All 18 A. veronii isolates were sensitive to florfenicol, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol, and were resistant to cefradine, clindamycin, <b>midecamycin,</b> penbritin, and amoxicillin. There were sensitivity diversities of the 18 A. veronii isolates to other test antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole, deoxycycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, and more. This in vitro study provides enough data to recommend the use of these antibiotics for treating infectious diseases caused by A. veronii...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the actual practice of}} diagnostics {{and treatment of}} patients with acute tonsillitis in order to assess the quality of primary prophylaxis of poststreptococcal diseases in different regions of Russia. Material and methods. The medical charts of 1333 adult outpts with acute tonsillitis in seven cities were analyzed. The data on each pts such as demographics, case history, bacteriological examinations results, prescribed medications, adverse events and outcomes of therapy were documented in case record forms. Data management was carried out using software. Results. Microbiological identifications of group A-streptococcus (GAS) were performed only in 0, 3 % of analyzed cases, so diagnosis of tonsillitis was based commonly on clinical data. Systemic antimicrobial drugs were prescribed to 95, 3 % of pts, among them to 91, 5 % as monotherapy and to 3, 8 % as combined therapy. Ampicillin was the most often initial antimicrobial (45, 0 %), other relatively frequently prescribed drugs were erythomycin (19, 1 %), ciprofloxacin (7, 0 %), doxycycline (5, 6 %), amoxycillin (5, 2 %), <b>midecamycin</b> (4, 4 %), ampicillin/oxacillin (3, 2 %). Two courses of antimicrobials were used in 8, 5 % of pts. The average duration of antibacterial therapy was 7, 4 ± 3, 4 days. The adverse events were noted in 0, 9 % of analyzed cases. Conclusion. The main problems of primary prophylaxis of poststreptococcal diseases were: (1) the diagnosis of tonsillitis without microbiological GAS identification, (2) prescribing antimicrobials without consideration of appropriate recommendation and (3) the lack of pathogen eradication control...|$|E
40|$|Early {{detection}} of drug-induced cholestasis remains a challenge during drug development. We have developed and validated a biorelevant sandwich-cultured hepatocytes- (SCH) based model that can identify compounds causing cholestasis by altering bile acid disposition. Human and rat SCH were exposed (24 - 48 h) to known cholestatic and/or hepatotoxic compounds, in presence or in {{absence of a}} concentrated mixture of bile acids (BAs). Urea assay {{was used to assess}} (compromised) hepatocyte functionality {{at the end of the}} incubations. The cholestatic potential of the compounds was expressed by calculating a drug-induced cholestasis index (DICI), reflecting the relative residual urea formation by hepatocytes co-incubated with BAs and test compound as compared to hepatocytes treated with test compound alone. Compounds with clinical reports of cholestasis, including cyclosporin A, troglitazone, chlorpromazine, bosentan, ticlopidine, ritonavir, and <b>midecamycin</b> showed enhanced toxicity in the presence of BAs (DICI ≤ 0. 8) for at least one of the tested concentrations. In contrast, the in vitro toxicity of compounds causing hepatotoxicity by other mechanisms (including diclofenac, valproic acid, amiodarone and acetaminophen), remained unchanged in the presence of BAs. A safety margin (SM) for drug-induced cholestasis was calculated as the ratio of lowest in vitro concentration for which was DICI ≤ 0. 8, to the reported mean peak therapeutic plasma concentration. SM values obtained in human SCH correlated well with reported % incidence of clinical drug-induced cholestasis, while no correlation was observed in rat SCH. This in vitro model enables early identification of drug candidates causing cholestasis by disturbed BA handling. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To test four 16 -membered {{macrolides}} (josamycin, spiramycin, <b>midecamycin</b> and rokitamycin) {{along with}} other compounds {{in the same class}} (erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin) plus clindamycin and telithromycin, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with well-characterized resistance genotypes. METHODS: Four hundred and eighty-six isolates of S. pyogenes and 375 isolates of S. pneumoniae were assayed for their macrolide susceptibilities and investigated by PCR to detect their different erythromycin resistance genes. All strains had been isolated over the period 2002 - 2003 from specimens of different human origin obtained in 14 different Italian centres. RESULTS: All 16 -membered macrolides showed very low MICs (MIC(50) s and MIC(90) s, or = 256 mg/L, whereas that for telithromycin was 4 mg/L; the MIC(50) s of 16 -membered macrolides and telithromycin ranged from or = 256 mg/L for those with erm(B). In S. pneumoniae, the MIC(50) s of the 16 -membered macrolides for the cMLS(B) isolates ranged from 0. 5 to 128 mg/L, whereas for the iMLS(B) isolates their values ranged from < or = 0. 06 to 4 mg/L; the MIC(50) s and MIC(90) s of telithromycin for both the cMLS(B) and the iMLS(B) isolates ranged from < or = 0. 06 to 0. 12 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: MICs ranged for all the drugs, except telithromycin, from or = 256 mg/L, with 15 % to 30 % resistant S. pyogenes for all drugs tested except clindamycin (8 %) and telithromycin (5. 4 %) and 10 % to 40 % resistant S. pneumoniae for all drugs tested except telithromycin (0. 3 %). In both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, erythromycin resistance related to a mef gene meant that telithromycin MICs were definitely higher than in erythromycin-susceptible isolates, although telithromycin susceptibility was preserved in all cases. In S. pyogenes, the activity of both 16 -membered macrolides and telithromycin against the iMLS(B) strains proved to be dependent on the erm gene involved, being greater against isolates with erm(A) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers we {{demonstrated that}} cyclosporin A (CsA) was specifically oxidized in rabbit and human liver by cytochrome P- 450 IIIA. We therefore anticipated that any drug {{that is an}} inducer or an inhibitor of this cytochrome should lead to interaction with CsA when given in association with it. In order to confirm this hypothesis, primary cultures of human hepatocytes and human liver microsomes were used to “reproduce” in vitro clinically significant interactions observed between CsA and drugs known either as specific inducers (i. e., rifampicin) or as specific inhibitors (i. e., erythromycin) of P- 450 IIIA. Our results were {{in close agreement with}} the clinical reports. Human hepatocytes maintained in primary cultures for 72 hr in the presence of 50 ΜM rifampicin exhibited increased levels of P- 450 IIIA, determined by Western blot using specific antibodies, and concomitant increase in CsA oxidase activity, determined by HPLC analysis of extra and intracellular media. Conversely, these cultures exhibited erythromycin concentrationdependent decreases in CsA oxidase activity when incubated in the presence of 5, 20, and 100 ΜM erythromycin. In addition, a Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the erythromycin-mediated inhibition of CsA oxidase activity in human liver microsomes revealed competitive inhibition (with K i of 75 ΜM) as expected, this macrolide being a specific substrate of P- 450 IIIA. Using this experimental approach, 59 molecules representative of 17 different therapeutic classes were screened for inducers and inhibitors of CsA oxidase activity. Our results allowed us to elucidate the molecular mechanism of previously observed, but unexplained, drug interactions involving CsA, and to detect drugs that should interfere with CsA metabolism as inducers or inhibitors. Drugs detected as potential inducers of CsA oxidase included: rifampicin, sulfadimidine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, phenylbutazone, dexamethasone, sulfinpyrazone, and carbamazepine. Drugs detected as potential competitive inhibitors included: triacetyloleandomycin, erythromycin, josamycin, <b>midecamycin,</b> ketoconazole, miconazole, midazolam, nifedipin, diltiazem, verapamil, nicardipine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, glibenclamide, bromocryptine, ethynylestradiol, progesterone, cortisol, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Finally cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, isoniazide, doxycycline, spiramycin, sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, pefloxacin, vancocin, trimethoprime, amphotericine B, valproic acid, quinidine, cimetidine, ranitidine, omeprazole, diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol, debrisoquine, guanoxan, captopril, furosemide, acetazolamide, sparteine, gliclazide, and imipramine were found not to interfere with the hepatic metabolism of CsA...|$|E
