40|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} tumors which developed around {{the mouth of}} chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and masu salmon (O. masou) after surviving an experimental infection of Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV) were studied histopathologically. The tumor tissues from the jaw of chum and masu salmon were composed of epithelial cells with the large light nuclei. The tumor {{was considered to be}} <b>malignant</b> <b>epithelioma</b> because of its active proliferation and intensive invasion of the connective tissues. Tumors which developed on the corneal epithelium and inneropercular of chum salmon showed similar characteristics to those around the mouth. Two types of tumor tissues also appeared in the kidney. One of them showed similar characteristics to those around the mouth and was presumed to be a transferable tumor. The others were characterized by their hyperplastic renal tuble cells (tuble epithelial cells) and their similarity in appearance to smooth muscle fibers...|$|E
40|$|AN Anglo-Indian woman, aged 58 years, {{suffering}} from turban tumour (cylindroma) had many large tumours {{on the body}} {{as well as the}} scalp. All the larger tumours were excised surgically and skin grafts were applied to the head where surgical " scalping " down to the pericranium was necessary to remove the turban tumour. The histology of these benign basal celled epidermal growths is similar to benign epithelioma adenoides cysticum (Brooke's disease) and to the <b>malignant</b> basal celled <b>epithelioma</b> (rodent ulcer). The epidermis is little changed except by stretching over the tumour. In the dermis there are spherical, oval or irregular masses of cells. The cells are round or oval and take up the basophil stain readily, especially the nuclei. Within the cell masses are areas of pink staining hyalinelike material giving the appearance of cysts as in epithelioma adenoides cysticum. At the periphery of the cell masses the cells are arranged in a pallisade manner and stain rather more deeply than those in the centre, this is also seen in the <b>malignant</b> basal celled <b>epithelioma</b> and in Brooke's disease. A feature of th...|$|R
