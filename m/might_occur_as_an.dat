Here, we review recent evidence showing that non-visual, telereceptor-mediated motor mapping <b>might</b> <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> autonomous process, as well as {{within the context of}} the multimodal perceptions and representations that characterize real-world experiences. Moreover, we discuss the role of auditory and olfactory resonance in anticipating the actions of others and, therefore, in shaping social interactions...|$|E
40|$|The livedoid vasculopathy {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{characterized by}} the presence of recurrent painful ulcers in distal extremities of lower limbs. Histologically there is thickness of dermal vessels, occlusion of its light by fibrin thrombi associated with minimal inflammatory infiltrate. It <b>might</b> <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> isolated condition or be associated with an underlying systemic disease, including coagulation and collagen disorders, or neoplasms. Because it is a rare disease there is no consensus for its treatment. We report a case of a 41 -year-old man with painful ulcers in the lower extremities. We did not find any associated diseases. The lesions improved dramatically after treatment with anticoagulant and hyperbaric therapy. We concluded that anticoagulation associated with hyperbaric oxygenation may be benefit for the treatment of patients with livedoid vasculopathy. However, further studies should be done with a larger population to confirm our results...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in hydrology is the time scale of the historical rainfall data, available from many meteorological data bases. Most of the rainfall data is given at a time scale coarser than the one needed for many applications in hydrology and environmental sciences, as the estimation of spatially continuous rainfall at finer time scales, for drainage systems design and extreme rainfall analysis. A method to disaggregate monthly rainfall to daily or finer temporal scale {{is very important in}} many applications. Many authors have addressed this problem by using some stochastic methods including several stochastic rainfall models. The lowering resolution methods must be low-cost and low-storage since the amount of rainfall data is large. The purpose of this work is to formulate this problem as a constrained optimization problem and solve it with a low-cost and low-storage deterministic optimization method. We modify the objective function proposed by Guenni and Bárdossy for solving the disaggregation rainfall problem and we use the low-cost spectral projected gradient (SPG) method. In contrast with the stochastic method, a deterministic approach will take into account important information, as for example the gradient of the objective function. The proposed method was applied to a data set from a rainfall network of the central plains of Venezuela, in which rainfall is highly seasonal and data availability at a daily time scale or even higher temporal resolution is very limited. The numerical results show that the SPG method for solving the disaggregation rainfall problem avoids daily precipitations outliers that <b>might</b> <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the simulation procedure and accurately reproduces the probability distribution. Also, the proposed model and methodology outperforms the one proposed by Guenni and Bárdossy (2002) {{in the sense that it}} reduces the absolute error value for the statistical properties from the observed data...|$|E

40|$|Apresentação efetuada no Microbiotec 2011, Braga, 2011 The use of {{commercial}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strains as fermentation starters {{has been extensively}} generalised {{over the past two}} decades. These strains are used by wineries every harvest time in large quantities. Within our previous work we showed that such strains are disseminated from the winery [1] and their permanence in nature induced genetic changes that were not found among a control group of isolates that derived from clonal expansion of the commercial “mother” strain [2]. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate genome variations among four isolates of the commercial strain S. cerevisiae Zymaflore VL 1 that were re-isolated from vineyards surrounding the wineries where this strain was applied, in comparison to the commercial “mother” strain, by the use of comparative genome hybridization on array. These approaches were carried out as described [3]. Data analysis showed genetic differences among the recovered isolates in comparison with the “mother” strain. Amplification (between 1 and 2 fold changes) of 14 genes were detected, related with mitosis (SHE 1) or meiosis (HFM 1), lysine biosynthesis (LYS 14), galactose (GAL 1) and asparagine catabolism (ASP 3 - 2). ASP 3 - 2 amplification is in agreement with the previously shown increased expression during nitrogen starvation. This <b>might</b> <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adaptation to natural environments with poor yeast-utilizable nitrogen sources. Eight Ty elements were also amplified, whereas each of the recovered strains had a unique pattern of amplifications. Phenotypic screening was performed considering 28 physiological tests. Seven phenotypic traits distinguished recovered strains from the “mother” strain which was unable to grow at 18 ºC, but evidenced some growth in the presence of CuSO 4 5 mM and SDS 0. 01 %. Variable growth patterns were found for NaCl 1. 5 M, KHSO 3 (300 mg/l) and wine supplemented with glucose (0. 5 % and 1 % w/v). We hypothesize that the transition from nutrient-rich musts to nutritionally scarce natural environments induces adaptive responses and microevolutionary changes promoted by Ty elements. These changes (and possibly others as well) may contribute to intra-strain phenotypic variability. [1] Schuller et al., 2007. Yeast 24 : 625 - 636 [2] Valero et al., 2005.

Individual β-lactamase variants may target one or many of these drug classes, and only a subset will be inhibited by a given β-lactamase inhibitor. β-lactamase inhibitors expand the useful spectrum of these β-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting the β-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria to deactivate them.|$|R

Using fluorescence and electron microscopy, we show that phages are internalized via the endolysosomal route and persist inside the human cells up to one day without affecting cell viability. Phage capsid integrity is lost in lysosomes, and the phage DNA is eventually degraded.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine the potential of pelvic visceral movement to create tension of the loose connective tissue that contains the fine branches of the inferior hypogastric nerve plexus. Methods Twenty eight embalmed human cadavers were examined. Pelvic visceral structures were displaced by very gentle 5 [*]N unidirectional tension and the associated movement of the endopelvic fascia containing the inferior hypogastric plexus that this caused was measured. Results Most movement of the fascia containing the inferior hypogastric plexus was obtained by pulling the rectosigmoid junction or broad ligament of the uterus. The plexus did not cross any vertebral joints and the fascia containing it did not move on pulling the hypogastric nerve. Conclusions Uterine and rectosigmoid displacement produce most movement of the fascia containing the hypogastric nerve plexus, potentially resulting in nerve tension.
