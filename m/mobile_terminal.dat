50|$|DECT {{provides}} dynamic {{channel selection}} and assignment; {{the choice of}} transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal.</b> In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or intercell handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30 s intervals to generate a RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) list. When a new channel is required, the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> (PP) or base station (FP) selects a channel with the minimum interference from the RSSI list.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the performance of}} distributed and centralised cooperative positioning system for multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals.</b> A cooperative positioning system uses ranging between base stations and <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals,</b> and in addition exploits the links between the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> as well. However, the number of links in an all-to-all connected setup increases quadratically {{with the number of}} nodes. Our goal is to schedule the access for the available resources (used bandwidth) to track the nodes of a dynamic system. Therefore, it is essential to reason if the different links between the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> are useful. The reasoning assists in allocating resources properly. We investigate distributed algorithms that act based on the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound. We use as benchmark a centralised and much more complex algorithm that requires all link information and we ignore any latency aspects.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the recent}} {{increases}} in prevalence of ubiquitous computing, applications {{have come to}} require context-awareness {{to a greater extent}} than before. One of the most significant elements of context is location information. There have been a number of attempts to design systems for the provision of location information indoors, although currently there is no conclusive method of doing so. We have attempted to design a calibration-free positioning system. Here, we describe WiPS, a wireless LAN-based indoor positioning system. Existing systems use only signal strength between access points and <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> to determine location, which is known as the AP-based method. In contrast, WiPS uses the signal strength not only between access points and <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> but also between neighboring <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals.</b> WiPS can provide more precise location information than AP-based methods. Simulation experiments showed that, in the case of 50 <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> in an area of 40, 000 m 2, average error is reduced by 58 % or more as compared with AP-based methods...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{downlink}} of mobile radio systems, where in each cell an access point communicates {{with a number of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals,</b> and where both the access point and the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> are equipped with multi-antennas. Therefore, the entirety of all downlink connections of each cell constitute a multi-user MIMO system. The considered downlink transmission technique is the recently proposed concept Joint Transmission (JT), which means that the receiver algorithms employed at the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> are a priori determined, whereas the transmitter algorithms utilized at the access point are a posteriori adapted under consideration of channel state information. This receiver oriented rationale allows the beneficial exploitation of channel state information at the access point. An important aspect in these considerations is the advantageous choice of the demodulators to be applied at the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> under consideration of channel state information. That is, exploiting channel state information at both the transmitter and the receiver leads to a channel oriented transmission scheme...|$|R
