5000|$|Some of the {{allegations}} included that IHH has been banned in Germany, that IHH has raised funds for jihadi fighters in Bosnia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan, that French intelligence has documented calls between the group and an Al Qaeda boarding house in Milan, Italy, as well as Algerian militants in Europe, and that IHH reportedly played an [...] "important role" [...] in the <b>Millennium</b> <b>bomb</b> plot against LAX airport, Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|The Free Gaza Movement {{was given}} funds by the Turkish IHH for its 2010 flotilla, which {{resulted}} in the deaths of nine Turkish activists on the MV Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid. In 2008, Israel designated the IHH as a terror group, accusing it of funneling support to Hamas and other terrorist groups. A 2006 report linked IHH to fundraising for jihadis headed to Bosnia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. In a Seattle trial, IHH was described as playing {{a major role in the}} Al Qaeda <b>Millennium</b> <b>bomb</b> plot targeting Los Angeles International Airport.|$|E

50|$|Ahmed Ressam, the {{terrorist}} convicted in 2001 of planning the foiled <b>Millennium</b> <b>bombing</b> of the Los Angeles Airport, alleged that Zemiri {{had been involved}} in the plot. In late 2006, he recanted his accusation entirely. In January 2010, Zemiri was freed from Guantanamo Bay and repatriated to Algeria.|$|R
5000|$|That IHH {{was banned}} in Germany later {{turned out to}} be a mixup between the Turkish İnsan Hak ve Hürriyetleri and the banned German Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.. The U.S. {{government}} said it [...] "cannot validate" [...] any relationship or connection between İHH and al-Qaida. Turkish authorities made no further efforts after the raid regarding support for Bosnian, Chechen and Afghan fighters and IHH replied that there was an acquittal in the court case and nothing ever came of the charges. Testimony regarding IHH and the <b>Millennium</b> <b>bomb</b> plot was thrown out in court by a judge because it would [...] "necessarily be based upon hearsay".|$|E
5000|$|Soufan {{was called}} to Jordan in 1999 to {{investigate}} the Jordan <b>Millennium</b> <b>Bombing</b> plot, and discovered a box of documents delivered by Jordanian intelligence officials prior to the investigation, {{sitting on the floor}} of the CIA station, which contained maps showing the bomb sites.

The worldwide renowned fireworks artist from Bellevue, Alberto Navarro has been designing {{the show for}} the past 20 year {{since its inception in}} 1994.

50|$|Hanani {{was indicted}} in the United States in August 2001 {{for being the}} mastermind of the plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport during the 2000 millennium. When Ahmed Ressam was apprehended, he had a {{business}} card with Hanani’s number and calling cards which were {{used to call it}} 11 days earlier.

Hanani has admitted meeting Ahmed Ressam in Jalalabad, but not being involved in the <b>millennium</b> <b>bombing</b> plot.|$|R
5000|$|After being {{tipped off}} by British intelligence, German police on 26 December 2000 {{discovered}} bomb-making equipment during a raid {{of an apartment}} in Frankfurt. Four men were arrested. Among the findings were several pressure cookers, 30kg of chemicals {{that could be used}} to make explosives, and a notebook describing how to mix homemade bombs. A video was also discovered, showing a crowded Christmas market in Strasbourg, with a voiceover in Arabic calling the people in the video [...] "enemies of Allah." [...] The voiceover, attributed to one of the suspects, further said [...] "This cathedral is Allah's enemy," [...] and [...] "You will go to hell, Allah willing." [...] The call that had alerted British intelligence had been made by one in the group asking Abu Doha, the alleged mastermind of the plot, for more cash; Doha was already wanted by the United States for his connection to the Los Angeles International Airport <b>millennium</b> <b>bombing</b> plot.|$|R
5000|$|On or near January 1, 2000, {{a series}} of Islamist {{terrorist}} attacks linked to al-Qaeda were planned {{to occur in the}} context of <b>millennium</b> celebrations, including <b>bombing</b> plots against four tourist sites in Jordan, against the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the , and the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814. In Lebanon, dozens were killed in clashes in the Dinnieh district between radical Islamists with connections to the Jordan plots and the Lebanese Army. The plots in Jordan and against LAX were foiled by law enforcement agencies, while the attempted bombing of The Sullivans only failed because the boat filled with explosives sank before detonating. The revelation of the plot linked to the LAX [...] "Millennium Bomber" [...] Ahmed Ressam led to unprecedented investigations into possible other terrorist cells in the United States, dubbed Operation [...] "Borderbom", and security measures around millennium celebrations. Other al-Qaeda-linked millennium attack plots may have been planned or foiled around the same time.|$|R
