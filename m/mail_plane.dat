5|$|Strong {{hurricane}} force {{winds were}} reported along the Louisiana coast at landfall. Grand Isle reported sustained winds of 100mph (160km/h), while gusts in Thibodaux and Napoleonville were estimated at 120mph (195km/h). Three churches, a warehouse, and ten stores were destroyed in Thibodaux. A weather station in New Orleans observed a peak wind gust of 52mph (84km/h). Severe damage was reported between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, which included uprooted trees and displaced barns. Roads were also blocked by debris. Window {{damage caused by}} strong winds was reported in New Orleans. Baton Rouge was affected by a power outage, resulting in $20,000 in losses to the local electric company. Communication wires were downed in Morgan City, preventing communication with other cities. Houses were also unroofed in the city by strong winds. A ferry was also wrecked by the hurricane offshore of Morgan Point. In Houma, an estimated 90% of sugar cane was lost due to the hurricane. The city's sugarhouse was also destroyed, along with an Episcopal church. Three passenger trains along the Southern Pacific Railroad were detained in Avondale, Louisiana after winds were determined to be too unsafe for rail operations. The strong winds and rain also caused a <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> to crash. In Tulane University, a chemistry building was destroyed by a fire during the hurricane. Several other fires were reported in various areas of New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|The Avro 627 Mailplane was a British biplane {{developed}} in 1931 by Avro from the Avro Antelope bomber as a <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> {{for use in}} Canada. Only one was built which ended up {{being used as a}} test bed.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, Boeing {{built its}} Model 40 <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> for the U.S. {{government}} {{to use on}} airmail routes. In 1927, an improved version of this plane was built, the Model 40A which won the U.S. Post Office's contract to deliver mail between San Francisco and Chicago. The 40A also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two.|$|E
25|$|Eaker was {{involved}} in a second attempt at aerial refueling in September 1929. Piloting a Boeing Model 95 <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> nicknamed the Boeing Hornet Shuttle on a transcontinental endurance flight eastbound from Oakland, California, he was refueled in flight by C-1s and Boeing Model 40 aircraft. Over Cleveland, Ohio, a Boeing refueling crew accidentally dropped a five-gallon can of oil through his wing, ending the first attempt. On a second attempt westbound, his engine quit over Utah when dirt clogged the fuel line, forcing him to crashland in the mountains near Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} month Ferrarin and del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, {{but across the}} South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio {{on the evening of}} 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within radio range of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160km (100mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> conveyed Ferrarin and del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100km (5,030mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188km (4,500mi) – the orthodromic distance between Montecelio and Natal – and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later.|$|E

500|$|It {{is claimed}} that, unlike the Heinkel He 111 series, whose {{military}} use was planned from the start, the Do 17 V1 was contracted as a fast six-passenger <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> {{to compete with}} the smaller Heinkel He 70 monoplane It has been suggested that it was rejected by Luft Hansa, as the cramped cabin was too uncomfortable for passenger use and the operating costs were too high for a <b>mail</b> <b>plane.</b> According to the story, the three prototypes remained unused in the Dornier factory in Lowental for almost six months, until Flight Captain Untucht of Luft Hansa came across them. After receiving permission to fly one of the machines, he proceeded to put it through an almost stunt flying routine. After landing, he said that [...] "the machine is as nimble as a fighter, give it more lateral stability and we'll have a high speed bomber!" [...] Untucht's comments prompted Dornier to redesign the tail unit and revived interest in the type.|$|E

2500|$|The exact date of {{the first}} flight of the TE.1 remains {{uncertain}} but it had completed its official testing at Villacoublay before April 1926. It was economical, with an optimum fuel consumption of about 16 km/l or 45 mpg, and was fully aerobatic. It was proposed as a potential single-seat trainer, a <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> or a military communications aircraft; {{it could also be}} equipped with a machine gun [...] "in place of cavalry".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{interest}} by Canadian Airways, {{who had a}} possible requirement for a <b>mail</b> <b>plane,</b> Roy Chadwick again redesigned the incomplete prototype to the Avro 627 Mailplane [...] This was a single-engine, single-bay biplane, powered by a 525hp (391kW) Panther engine and fitted for wheel or float operation. The sole prototype (G-ABJM) was certificated on 2 August 1931, and was shipped to Canada for operational trials. While these trials were successful, the Canadian government cut the subsidy for civil aviation and so Canadian Airways was unable to afford new aircraft, so the mailplane was returned to England.|$|E
2500|$|The Saro-Percival Mailplane was a three-engined {{monoplane}} <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> {{designed by}} Edgar Percival, and built by Saunders-Roe Limited (Saro) at Cowes in 1931, the aircraft first flying early in 1932. [...] It was a low-winged monoplane, {{with a wooden}} wing and plywood fuselage, and was powered by three 120hp de Havilland Gipsy III engines. When Saro was financially re-organised, Percival sold {{his interest in the}} aircraft to Saro, who re-designated it as the Saro A.24 Mailplane. Due to the close ties between Saro and Spartan Aircraft, the development of the aircraft was transferred to Spartan, and the aircraft was re-designated again as the Spartan Mailplane. [...] The aircraft was modified to accommodate two passenger seats. Starting on 15 June 1932, the Mailplane (G-ABLI) flew from Stanley Park Aerodrome (Blackpool) to Karachi, India taking a total of 5 days 23 hours 50 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Hartsfield–Jackson had its {{beginnings}} with a five-year, rent-free lease on [...] {{that was an}} abandoned auto racetrack named The Atlanta Speedway. The lease was signed April 16, 1925, by Mayor Walter Sims, who committed the city to develop it into an airfield. As part of the agreement, the property was renamed Candler Field after its former owner, Coca-Cola tycoon and former Atlanta mayor Asa Candler. The first flight into Candler Field was September 15, 1926, a Florida Airways <b>mail</b> <b>plane</b> flying from Jacksonville, Florida. In May 1928, Pitcairn Aviation began service to Atlanta, followed in June 1930 by Delta Air Service. Later those two airlines, now known as Eastern Air Lines and Delta Air Lines, respectively, would both use Atlanta as their chief hubs. The airport's weather station became the official location for Atlanta's weather observations September 1, 1928, and records by the National Weather Service.|$|E
2500|$|The Airplane Engineering Department, {{precursor}} of ASC, was first established under the U.S. Army's Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in late 1917 at McCook Field. [...] Early on the department's focus was flight testing and training. [...] The department was renamed the Airplane Engineering Division following World War I, it continued its mission of flight testing and training, but also began development and engineering. [...] One early native model, the VCP-1 {{was designed by}} resident engineers, Alfred V. Verville and Virginius E. Clark. [...] Another aircraft tested was the MB-1, eventually used as the standard <b>mail</b> <b>plane.</b> [...] The division also expanded operations to Wilbur Wright Field. [...] The division also pioneered aviation safety {{with the use of}} free-fall parachutes and the development of protective clothing, closed cockpits, heated and pressurized cabins, and oxygen systems. [...] As the stockpile of aircraft and parts grew the division was able to spend more time finding ways to enhance tools and procedures for pilots. [...] Advancements include things like an electric ignition system, anti-knock fuels, navigational aids, improved weather forecasting techniques, stronger propellers, advancements in aerial photography, and the design of landing and wing lights for night flying.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though it}} was {{obsolete}} {{by the time it}} entered production in 1922, the A.14 is nevertheless noteworthy for its role in the establishment of Czech airline CSA. A.14s provided by the Czech Air Force served to survey routes that CSA airliners would soon fly, and at least 17 were put into service as <b>mail</b> <b>planes</b> between Prague and Bratislava. They could also carry a single passenger when required.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} H-47 first {{flew from}} Antibes on 25 July 1936, and {{was destroyed in}} a crash in May 1937 that was attributed to a wingtip float breaking away whilst the aircraft was in flight.
