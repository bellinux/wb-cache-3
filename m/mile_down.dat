25|$|As {{early as}} 1850, the {{inhabitants}} of the hamlet of La Croix du Bac, which is included as a part of Steenwerck, but is just over a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the road, had designed a project to build a church, despite opposition from the parish priest of Steenwerck, {{as well as from the}} town council and local merchants. A plot of land was offered by Mr. Amand Chieux. Some residents of La Croix du Bac gave money, others gave their labour and materials: and, so the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows was built.|$|E

25|$|The Princess and {{her husband}} had homes in London, Chesterfield House and in Yorkshire, first Goldsborough Hall, and later Harewood House. While at Goldsborough Hall, Princess Mary had {{internal}} alterations made by the architect Sydney Kitson, to suit the upbringing of her two children and instigated the development of formal planting of beech-hedge-lined long borders from the south terrace looking for a quarter of a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> an avenue of lime trees. The limes were planted by her relatives as they visited the Hall throughout the 1920s, including her father George V and her mother Queen Mary.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the well}} known mining {{communities}} AltHouse established the AltHouse Church in 1893 about a 1/4 <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> on Dick George Road. This church {{is one of the}} oldest building in the valley still standing and still in use. Between 1895–99 the church was moved down to its present site on Holland Loop Road where it has served the community till this day. It is currently known as Bridgeview Community Church (since the 1920s). A newer building was built in 1986 where services are now being held every Sunday. The original church is currently under restoration and will continue to be as the builders back then said; [...] "A place for us or children and grandchildren to worship".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, writing that [...] "'The Beginning' opens witty enough [...] and then offers the viewer no substance. It's a better season opener than 'Redux' [...] but it's still very poor." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She derided the episode's plot, noting that the episode was [...] "another <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the X-Files Road of Mythology. Monster aliens?

500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half <b>Mile</b> <b>Down</b> [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

The fortress was burned down and the second Bayernburg was built about one <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the Neman River. The reasons for this relocation is not known. Perhaps the first fortress was too far into the Lithuanian frontier and was difficult to supply and maintain.|$|E

Bob Wills was heard on every jukebox with this [...] "San Antonio Rose". T. Texas Tyler was doing well with his [...] "Remember Me (When the Candlelights are Gleaming)".

2500|$|Although Beebe had {{initially}} agreed to write two articles for National Geographic {{in exchange for}} the National Geographic Society's sponsorship, after he had written the first of the two he and the magazine's editor agreed that it was not interesting enough to be a stand-alone story, {{and that it would be}} better to combine the two into a single article. [...] Beebe's account of his record-setting dive was published in the December 1934 issue of National Geographic, along with sixteen of Bostelmann's paintings, under the title [...] "A Half Mile Down: Strange Creatures Beautiful and Grotesque as Figments of Fancy, Reveal Themselves at Windows of Bathysphere". [...] The text of this article also became the climactic chapter of Beebe's book Half <b>Mile</b> <b>Down,</b> which appeared in bookstores in time for Christmas of that year and was an immediate best-seller.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the western slopes and ridge-top grass promenade, the Coniston face is all crag. A short high level spur juts out from the summit, ending in the shattered cliffs of Raven Tor. To either side of this promontory is a corrie tarn, Low Water {{to the south and}} Levers Water to the north. Low Water is the smaller, its depth increased by a stone faced dam built by the nearby slate quarries. The outflow drops via a fine waterfall to join Levers Water Beck a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> stream. Levers Water was also dammed in times past for industrial use (in this case the Coniston Coppermines), but now provides domestic supply for Coniston village. The stone faced dam has increased its depth to some 125ft. Running parallel to the ridge below Low Water is an unusual lateral valley, named [...] "Boulder Valley" [...] on Ordnance Survey maps due to the number of large erratics on its floor.|$|E
