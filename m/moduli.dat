25|$|In mathematics, the Enriques–Kodaira {{classification}} is {{a classification}} of compact complex surfaces into ten classes. For {{each of these}} classes, the surfaces in the class can be parametrized by a <b>moduli</b> space. For most of the classes the <b>moduli</b> spaces are well understood, but for the class of surfaces of general type the <b>moduli</b> spaces seem too complicated to describe explicitly, though some components are known.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to construct a kind of <b>moduli</b> space of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and then the Ricci flow really does give a geometric flow (in the intuitive sense of particles flowing along flowlines) in this <b>moduli</b> space.|$|E
25|$|Harder and M. S. Narasimhan {{described}} the cohomology of the <b>moduli</b> spaces of stable vector bundles over Riemann surfaces by counting {{the number of}} points of the <b>moduli</b> spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|Care must {{be taken}} insofar as two tori are always homeomorphic, but in general not biholomorphic to each other. This is the first {{appearance}} {{of the problem of}} <b>moduli.</b> The modulus of a torus can be captured by a single complex number τ with positive imaginary part. In fact, the marked <b>moduli</b> space (Teichmüller space) of the torus is biholomorphic to the upper half-plane or equivalently the open unit disk.|$|E
25|$|Degenerate conics, as with {{degenerate}} algebraic varieties generally, arise as {{limits of}} non-degenerate conics, and {{are important in}} compactification of <b>moduli</b> spaces of curves.|$|E
25|$|In {{his paper}} with Jones, {{he studied the}} {{topology}} of the <b>moduli</b> space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this <b>moduli</b> space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of homology groups in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This {{became known as the}} Atiyah–Jones conjecture, and was later proved by several mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|Modular forms {{can also}} be profitably {{approached}} from this geometric direction, as sections of line bundles on the <b>moduli</b> space of elliptic curves.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah's work on instanton <b>moduli</b> spaces {{was used}} in Donaldson's work on Donaldson theory. Donaldson showed that the <b>moduli</b> space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply {{connected}} 4-manifold with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent smooth structures on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other <b>moduli</b> spaces studied by Atiyah to define Donaldson invariants, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed {{that they were more}} subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of papers with several authors, Atiyah {{classified}} all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer he calculated the dimension of the <b>moduli</b> space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem). For example, the dimension of the space of SU2 instantons of rank k>0 is 8k−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the <b>moduli</b> space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These <b>moduli</b> spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his invariants of 4-manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{elliptic}} and parabolic surfaces, no {{classification of}} the hyperbolic surfaces is possible. Any connected open strict {{subset of the}} plane gives a hyperbolic surface; consider the plane minus a Cantor set. A classification is possible for surfaces of finite type: those isomorphic to a compact surface with {{a finite number of}} points removed. Any one of these has a finite number of <b>moduli</b> and so a finite-dimensional Teichmüller space. The problem of <b>moduli</b> (solved by Lars Ahlfors and extended by Lipman Bers) was to justify Riemann's claim that for a closed surface of genus g, 3gnbsp&minus&nbsp&3 complex parameters suffice.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} amplitudes {{described}} above {{is relevant to}} quantum state vectors. It is also used {{in the context of}} unitary operators that are important in the scattering theory, notably in the form of S-matrices. Whereas <b>moduli</b> of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, <b>moduli</b> of matrix elements squared are interpreted as transition probabilities just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional unit vector specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional unitary matrix specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states. Note that columns of a unitary matrix, as vectors, have the norm 1.|$|E
25|$|As {{is often}} the case in number theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all <b>moduli</b> p, q, etc., are assumed to be positive, odd primes.|$|E
25|$|He studied skyrmions with Nick Manton, {{finding a}} {{relation}} with magnetic monopoles and instantons, and giving a conjecture for {{the structure of}} the <b>moduli</b> space of two skyrmions as a certain subquotient of complex projective 3-space.|$|E
25|$|A CRC is a {{checksum}} in {{a strict}} mathematical sense, {{as it can}} be expressed as the weighted modulo-2 sum of per-bit syndromes, but that word is generally reserved more specifically for sums computed using larger <b>moduli,</b> such as 10, 256, or 65535.|$|E
25|$|A marked K3 {{surface is}} a K3 surface {{together}} with an isomorphism from II3,19 to H2(X, Z). The <b>moduli</b> space of marked K3 surfaces is connected non-Hausdorff smooth analytic space of dimension 20. The algebraic K3 surfaces form a countable collection of 19-dimensional subvarieties of it.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, theta {{functions}} are special functions of several complex variables. They {{are important in}} many areas, including the theories of Abelian varieties and <b>moduli</b> spaces, and of quadratic forms. They have also been applied to soliton theory. When generalized to a Grassmann algebra, they also appear in quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|Although TQFTs {{were invented}} by physicists, {{they are also}} of {{mathematical}} interest, being related to, among other things, knot theory and the theory of four-manifolds in algebraic topology, and {{to the theory of}} <b>moduli</b> spaces in algebraic geometry. Donaldson, Jones, Witten, and Kontsevich have all won Fields Medals for work related to topological field theory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck recast the {{foundations}} {{making use of}} sheaf theory. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of schemes was worked out, {{in conjunction with a}} very refined apparatus of homological techniques. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to number theory and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, singularities and <b>moduli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Atiyah {{showed that}} instantons in 4 {{dimensions}} {{can be identified}} with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the <b>moduli</b> spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations {{turn out to be}} essentially the same.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stabilizer}} of a dessin is the {{subgroup of}} Γ consisting of group elements that leave the dessin unchanged. Due to the Galois correspondence between subgroups of Γ and algebraic number fields, the stabilizer {{corresponds to a}} field, the field of <b>moduli</b> of the dessin. An orbit of a dessin is the set of all other dessins into which it may be transformed; due to the degree invariant, orbits are necessarily finite and stabilizers are of finite index. One may similarly define the stabilizer of an orbit (the subgroup that fixes all elements of the orbit) and the corresponding field of <b>moduli</b> of the orbit, another invariant of the dessin. The stabilizer of the orbit is the maximal normal subgroup of Γ contained in the stabilizer of the dessin, and the field of <b>moduli</b> of the orbit corresponds to the smallest normal extension of Q that contains the field of <b>moduli</b> of the dessin. For instance, for the two conjugate dessins considered in this section, the field of <b>moduli</b> of the orbit is Q (...) [...] The two Belyi functions f1 and f2 of this example are defined over the field of <b>moduli,</b> but there exist dessins for which the field of definition of the Belyi function must be larger than the field of <b>moduli.</b>|$|E
