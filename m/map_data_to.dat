The proposed hybrid scheme combines simply the kernel-feature spaces separation technique (KTDSEP) and {{the principle of}} the slow feature analysis (SFA). The nonlinear mixed <b>data</b> is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> high dimensional feature space using kernel-based method. Then, the linear blind source separation (BSS) based on the slow feature analysis (SFA) is used to extract the most slowness vectors among the independent data vectors. The proposed scheme is based on the following four key features: 1) estimating an orthonormal bases, 2) <b>mapping</b> the <b>data</b> into the subspace using this orthonormal bases, 3) applying linear BSS on the <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> make the <b>data</b> vectors in the feature spaces are independent, 4) Applying the principle of slow feature analysis on the <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> select the desired signals.

We {{analyze the}} {{sensitivity}} to parameters {{and the general}} applicability of genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms for <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> distributed-memory multicomputers, using the loosely synchronous computation model. The analysis includes sensitivity to user parameters, fault tolerance capability, and applicability to different multicomputer topologies. The user parameters are either objective function dependent or algorithm dependent. The fault tolerance capability is demonstrated by using the mapping algorithms for <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> a multicomputer that has some failed processors. We assume a hypercube multicomputer architecture in most experiments. However, comparative results for mesh, array, ring, tree, star graph, and fully connected topologies are presented. The mapping algorithms used are sequential hybrid genetic algorithm, versions of a distributed genetic algorithm, sequential simulated annealing algorithm, and a simulated parallel simulated annealing algorithm. The experimental results verifY that these algorithms are insensitive to user parameters in wide ranges, completely fault tolerant, and unbiased towards particular multicomputer topologies.
