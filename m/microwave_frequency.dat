5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency,</b> the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does {{work against the}} bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency,</b> and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.|$|E

50|$|Thus at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies,</b> most of {{the current}} flows in an {{extremely}} thin region near the surface. Ohmic losses of waveguides at <b>microwave</b> <b>frequencies</b> are therefore only dependent on the surface coating of the material.

25|$|In an EPR machine the {{magnetic}} assembly includes {{the magnetic}} with a dedicated power supply {{as well as}} a field sensor or regulator such as a Hall probe. EPR machines use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume and has a high stability at static field.|$|E
25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency.</b> The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectral}} shape {{and intensity of}} the optical signals from the N-V− centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of {{spectral shape}} for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond {{would have to be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures to sharpen the N-V− signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few nanotesla or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at kilohertz frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V− center.|$|E

500|$|A {{household}} {{demonstration of}} this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the <b>microwave</b> <b>frequency</b> (usually displayed {{on the back of}} the oven, typically 2450MHz), the value of c can be calculated, [...] "often with less than 5% error".|$|E
