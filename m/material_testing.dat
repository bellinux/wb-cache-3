5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the <b>Material</b> <b>Testing</b> Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E

25|$|Technetium-99m was {{discovered}} {{as a product}} of cyclotron bombardment of molybdenum. This procedure produced molybdenum-99, a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m. In turn, this Mo-99 is usually created commercially by fission of highly enriched uranium in aging research and <b>material</b> <b>testing</b> nuclear reactors in several countries.|$|E
