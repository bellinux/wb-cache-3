Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in inches of water, expressed as [...] "inches W.C." [...] Scuba divers often use a manometric rule of thumb: the pressure exerted by ten meters depth of sea water ("10 msw") is approximately equal to one atmosphere. In vacuum systems, the units torr (millimeter <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> micron (micrometer <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> and inch <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> (inHg) are most commonly used.

50|$|A McLeod gauge {{isolates}} {{a sample}} of gas and compresses it in a modified mercury manometer until the pressure is a few <b>millimetres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> The technique is slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading {{is dependent on the}} composition of the gas since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an ideal gas. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.|$|R
30|$|Once {{the patient}} was enrolled, IBP was {{measured}} according to the WSACS consensus recommendations using the standard bladder technique [3]. The IBP was measured through the patient's indwelling catheter, according to the modified Kron technique using an AbViser 300 or AbViser 611 kit (AbViser, Wolfe Tory Medical, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) [11, 12]. The transducer was zeroed on the mid-axillary line {{at the level of}} the superior iliac crest.

5000|$|Various {{units are}} used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre; similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the {{traditional}} unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. Pressure may also be {{expressed in terms of}} standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as [...] of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, <b>millimetre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> and inch of mercury {{are used to}} express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.|$|E
50|$|Because {{pressure}} is commonly measured by {{its ability to}} displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., centimetres of water, millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury). The most common choices are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) {{to be used to}} measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height h and density ρ is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation p = ρgh, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units. One <b>millimetre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> is approximately equal to one torr. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These manometric units are still encountered in many fields. Blood {{pressure is}} measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine which closure technique- simple interrupted suture (SIS), simple continuous suture (SCS), interrupted double loop closure (IDLC) or continuous double loop closure (CDLC) - results in stronger wound repair after midline laparotomy. Surgery was performed on 48 male rats. On the 5 th postoperative day the rats were sacrificed and wound strength was measured by inserting a balloon into the abdomen and filling it with air until the abdomen burst. Pressure was measured in <b>millimetres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> Abdominal bursting pressure was 281. 25 ± 26. 5 mm Hg (mean ± SD) in the SIS group, 287. 91 ± 29. 6 mm Hg in the SCS group, 295. 41 ± 31. 9 mm Hg in the IDLC group and 314. 58 ± 24. 7 mm Hg in the CDLC group (P< 0. 05). Closure of the midline abdominal incisions using SCS has almost the same wound strength as SIS or IDLC but it is recommended because of simplicity, speed, and costs. CDLC ensures the greatest wound strength on the basis of the intraperitoneal pressure required to burst the abdomen. The results of the comparison of the SIS to SCS, as well as IDLC to CDLC, show that continuous suture techniques are more favourable than the interrupted suture techniques from which they were derived.

30|$|In {{the study}} design, {{we have tried}} to limit the {{variation}} between the two techniques further by performing same-day measurements within 1 to 2 h. A further source of variation, which has not been considered in previous validation studies, is the impact that changes of the pre-scan arterial blood gas status might have on rCBF [29]. The PaCO 2 decreased significantly by 2 mmHg from PET to CT scanning, suggesting slight hyperventilation. Hyperventilation decreases rCBF by washing out PaCO 2 by approximately 2 % per <b>millimetre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> [31, 32]. This would decrease the rCBF CT measurements by 4 % and further increase the difference between techniques if corrected for. The hyperventilation itself may have been caused by anticipatory anxiety in the CT scanning session possibly associated to the procedure itself. Mood states in scanning sessions have been investigated by Matthew et al. [28], and a trend was found for anticipatory anxiety to be lowered from the first to second scans. This may have been forestalled by letting the subjects rest in the CT scanner for several minutes before scans and maybe even perform a 'sham-scan' before scans.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this review}} study is to {{summarize}} 30 years of research on cut-off limits for the self-measured blood pressure. METHODS: We reviewed two meta-analyses, several prospective outcome studies in populations and hypertensive patients, studies in pregnant women, three clinical trials and the thresholds proposed in earlier and current hypertension guidelines. RESULTS: In line with existing guidelines, prospective studies support that levels of the self-measured blood pressure at home of {{greater than or equal}} to 135 mmHg systolic or {{greater than or equal to}} 85 mmHg diastolic indicate hypertension. Circumstantial data suggest that levels of the self-measured blood pressure below 120 / 80 and 130 / 85 mmHg are optimal and normal, respectively. Therapeutic targets of the self-measured blood pressure to be attained on antihypertensive drug treatment are currently unknown, but should logically be lower (< 135 / 85 mmHg) than those used to diagnose hypertension. Currently, there is no proof that therapeutic thresholds for the home blood pressure should be lower in high-risk compared with normal-risk patients. A large body of evidence, however, demonstrated that each <b>millimetre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> of blood pressure lowering counts in the prevention of cardiovascular complications and that in high-risk patients even small decreases in blood pressure result in large absolute benefit. CONCLUSION: The thresholds to diagnose hypertension from self-measured blood pressure readings at home remain unaltered since the 2000 consensus conference, but are currently supported by outcome data. Further studies need to establish what values of the self-measured blood pressure are optimal and normal in terms of cardiovascular outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{aspiration}} vacuum and needle diameter on the morphology of the cumulus-oocyte-complex (COG) and developmental {{capacity of the}} oocyte after IVF was studied in 2 experiments using a disposable ovum pick-up needle guidance system whose construction permits its use in vitro. In Experiment 1, the relationship was determined between the aspiration vacuum, expressed in <b>millimetre</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> and the actual amount of water aspirated by the system, expressed in millilitre per minute. In Experiment 2, five different levels of aspiration vacuum for 3 different needle diameters (18 g, 19 g and 21 g) were tested in slaughterhouse ovaries. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were divided into 3 categories: 1) oocytes with a compact cumulus, 2) oocytes with an expanded cumulus and 3) naked oocytes. The results show that a change of needle diameter can triple the amount of fluid actually aspirated. The highest oocyte recovery rates are obtained when using the thickest needle (Is-g), regardless of the aspiration vacuum. On the average, for all needle types, more oocytes are recovered at the highest aspiration vacuum. For all needle diameters, the proportion of oocytes surrounded by a compact cumulus decreases progressively as the vacuum increases. Regardless of the vacuum applied, thinner needles result in {{a higher proportion of}} recovered COCs with a compact cumulus. At a high aspiration vacuum, naked oocytes become predominant regardless of the needle diameter. The prevalence of blastocysts, expressed in proportion to the recovered COCs, decreases as the aspiration vacuum increases, being especially noticeable between 70 and 130 mm Hg...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevention}} {{and control of}} high blood pressure or other cardiovascular diseases has not received due attention in many developing countries. This study aims to describe the epidemiology {{of high blood pressure}} among adults in Addis Ababa, so as to inform policy and lay the ground for surveillance interventions. Methods Addis Ababa is the largest urban centre and national capital of Ethiopia, hosting about 25 % of the urban population in the country. A probabilistic sample of adult males and females, 25 – 64 years of age residing in Addis Ababa city participated in structured interviews and physical measurements. We employed a population based, cross sectional survey, using the World Health Organization instrument for stepwise surveillance (STEPS) of chronic disease risk factors. Data on selected socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviours, including physical activity, as well as physical measurements such as weight, height, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure were collected through standardized procedures. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the coefficient of variability of blood pressure due to selected socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics, and physical measurements. Results A total of 3713 adults participated in the study. About 20 % of males and 38 % of females were overweight (body-mass-index ≥ 25 kg/m 2), with 10. 8 (9. 49, 12. 11) % of the females being obese (body-mass-index ≥ 30 kg/m 2). Similarly, 17 % of the males and 31 % of the females were classified as having low level of total physical activity. The age-adjusted prevalence (95 % confidence interval) of high blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg (<b>millimetres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury)</b> or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg or reported use of anti-hypertensive medication, was 31. 5 % (29. 0, 33. 9) among males and 28. 9 % (26. 8, 30. 9) among females. Conclusion High blood pressure is widely prevalent in Addis Ababa and may represent a silent epidemic in this population. Overweight, obesity and physical inactivity are important determinants of high blood pressure. There is an urgent need for strategies and programmes to prevent and control high blood pressure, and promote healthy lifestyle behaviours primarily among the urban populations of Ethiopia. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Refractory {{hypertension}} {{is blood}} pressure that remains above 140 / 90 <b>millimetres</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> (mmHg), despite the adherence to appropriate lifestyle {{changes and the}} concurrent use of optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents of different classes (Pisoni et al., 2009). Hypertension results in 7. 6 million deaths annually and 92 million disability adjusted years worldwide (Mooren, 2012), and thus it {{is the number one}} attributable risk for death throughout the world (Pickering, 2008). It has also been observed to be higher in urban populations compared to rural populations (Peltzer & Mafuya, 2013). A direct positive relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk has been observed in men and women of all ages, races and ethnic groups regardless of other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (Hall et al., 2008). Conventional treatment involves lifestyle modification and antihypertensive drug therapy however these measures may not reduce blood pressure effectively (McPhee et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2008). Some preliminary studies have shown the usefulness of homoeopathic complexes in the treatment of essential hypertension (Kohler et al., 2004; Mogapi & Tsele-Tebakang, 2014). There has been no research done to date on the effect of the combination of Amylenum nitrosum 6 cH, Crataegus oxyacantha 6 cH, Natrum muriaticum 6 cH and Scutellaria lateriflora 6 cH in adults with refractory hypertension. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a homoeopathic complex containing Amylenum nitrosum 6 cH, Crataegus oxyacantha 6 cH, Natrum muriaticum 6 cH and Scutellaria lateriflora 6 cH on blood pressure in adults with refractory hypertension, by means of blood pressure readings. This study was a six week, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. Potential participants aged 35 - 65 years with refractory hypertension that responded to the advert (Appendix A) attended an initial consultation and were requested to read and sign a Participant Information and Consent Form (Appendix C). All consultations took place under the supervision of a qualified homoeopath. The medical history and physical examination (including vital signs, fundoscopic exam, cardiovascular exam, respiratory exam and urinalysis) were recorded on the Case Form (Appendix D). Blood pressure readings were taken on each arm with a manual blood pressure cuff according to standard operating procedures (Appendix E). Individuals with secondary organ damage from hypertension were excluded from the study. Those participants that qualified for the study were placed into two groups.
