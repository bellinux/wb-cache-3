5000|$|By {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, major {{advances}} in design theory, graphic statics, and knowledge of <b>material</b> <b>strengths</b> had been achieved. As the nineteenth century neared its end, the major factor contributing to the need for scientific design of bridges was the railroads. Engineers had to know the precise levels of stresses in bridge members, in order to accommodate the impact of trains. The first design solution was obtained by Squire Whipple in 1847. His major breakthrough was that truss members could be analyzed as a system of forces in equilibrium. This system, known as the [...] "method of joints," [...] permits the determination of stresses in all known members of a truss if two forces are known. The next advance in design was the [...] "method of sections," [...] developed by Wilhelm Ritter in 1862. Ritter simplified the calculations of forces by developing a very simple formula for determining the forces in the members intersected by a cross-section. A third advance was a better method of graphical analysis, developed independently by J.C. Maxwell (UK) and Karl Culmann. (Switzerland).|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Timber is an organic, {{orthotropic}} {{material of}} which the strength is currently not fully utilised in structural designs. Most design codes treat timber as an isotropic material with special clauses {{to compensate for the}} weaker strength across the grain. Several safety factors are used to accommodate the large variations in the strength of timber. In the orthotropic approach presented here, the unidirectional properties of timber are assumed as constant. It is also assumed that the large strength variation which is observed between samples of the same group, can mostly be attributed to the grain slope variation in a sample. The finite element method is employed to model grain slopes around a predetermined defect in a sample. The sample is then forced to fail at this defect, and the finite element model is then analyzed at the failure load to determine which stress combination led to the failure. Initial unidirectional <b>material</b> <b>strengths</b> are used in a failure criterion to evaluate the critical stress combination. The method of least squares is used to fit the predicted strength against the experimental strength. In this process new values are found for the unidirectional <b>material</b> <b>strengths.</b> The process is then repeated to determine whether another stress combination is not more critical than the original choice. As soon as the numerically acquired <b>material</b> <b>strengths</b> stabilise, it is compared with known values. The results indicate that the strength of a timber section can be predicted {{on the grounds of the}} observed fibre directions if the unidirectional <b>material</b> <b>strengths</b> are known...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} effects of loading paths and stress states on rock {{strength}} and deformation, marble specimens were axially compressed to various displacements under a confining pressure (CP) firstly, and then the damaged specimens were recompressed under another CP. The bearing capacity of a marble specimen depends merely on CP at the stage of ductile deformation, and it has no relation with the loading history when CP keeps constant or increases. However, the damaged specimen turns into brittle when it is recompressed uniaxially or at a lower CP, and the Young’s modulus and strength are lower than those of a dense specimen. The increasing ratio of triaxial strength to CP has a close relation with the areas of fissures in the damaged specimens but not the internal friction angle. <b>Material</b> <b>strength</b> and bearing capacity are two different conceptions for rocks. <b>Material</b> <b>strength</b> decreases continually as the plastic deformation increases; however, the bearing capacity is determined by both the stress state and the <b>material</b> <b>strength...</b>|$|R

We find that the power-law index of the small body population is unaffected by the strength law for the large bodies, and vice versa. Simple analytical expressions describe a wave that is superimposed on the large body population because of the transition between the two power laws describing the strength. These analytical results yield excellent agreement with a numerical simulation of collisional evolution. These results will help to interpret observations of the asteroids and KBOs, and constrain the strength properties of those objects...|$|R
