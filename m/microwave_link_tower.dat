40|$|This article {{tells the}} story behind the {{uncovering}} of the US operated global telecommunications interceptions system now known as ECHELON. It begins with the use of fieldwork techniques in the early 1970 ’s exploring the configuration of Britain’s Post Office Towers – these were ostensibly the <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> through which Britain’s long distance telephone calls were made. This modelling process revealed a system within the system of <b>microwave</b> <b>towers</b> <b>linked</b> to the American Base of Menwith Hill in the North York Moors. All the key researchers were then promptly arrested, a raid by Special Branch on the author’s university at Lancaster ensued and later a show trail for the other main researchers, most notably Duncan Campbell. Eventually in 1988, Duncan wrote up the ECHELON story, which for its time was an incredible piece of detective work using materials lifted from waste bins by the women activists campaigning around the Menwith Hill Base. Little notice was taken until 1997 when an obscure book by Nicky Hager, Secret Power explained the role and function of ECHELON in more depth. The author represented these findings in a policy report to the European Parliament on the technology of political control that led to a process of political debate and disagreement of the ethics of such a system which continues even today...|$|R

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>links</b> {{are very}} {{commonly}} used in carrier networks especially towards the access side. They not only ease deployment of a network but are also very cost effective. However, they bring along a multitude of challenges which are characteristic of the wireless technology. <b>Microwave</b> <b>links</b> are fickle. Being exposed to varying weather conditions, they experience bandwidth fluctuations. This is true {{especially in the case}} of links operating at higher frequencies. The unpredictable nature of <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> makes it quite challenging to plan capacity in a network beforehand. Radio links employ adaptive modulation. They operate on a range on modulation schemes each of which offers different throughput and bit error rates. When operating at a low bit rate modulation scheme, a situation may arise where the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> is not able to support the entire traffic incident from the backbone network. As a result, the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> will suffer from congestion and packets arriving at the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> will eventually be dropped. The switching nodes that precede the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> along a communication path are unaware of the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> conditions and, therefore, continue to transmit traffic at a high rate. Large carrier networks cannot afford to have performance inconsistencies like data loss and increased latency. Service degradation, even for a very short duration, can have dire consequences in terms of customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss. The goal of this thesis is to use MPLS-TP Linear Protection to load balance traffic across alternative paths in a network where links use adaptive modulation. Rerouted traffic must take other paths so that the congested <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> is completely avoided. The idea is augmented by the use of a radio condition signaling mechanism between the packet switching node and the microwave node that precede a <b>microwave</b> <b>link.</b> The <b>microwave</b> node sends radio condition control messages to the preceding packet switching node to rate limit traffic and avoid congestion at the <b>microwave</b> <b>link.</b> The result of this thesis work is a system prototype that achieves the stated goal. Evaluation of the prototype is carried out through graphical results, generated by a traffic generator, that advocate the correctness, performance and robustness of the system...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{rainfall}} observations {{with high}} {{spatial and temporal}} resolutions are needed for many applications, for instance, as input for hydrological models. Weather radars often provide data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, but usually need adjustment. In general, only few rain gauge measurements are available to adjust the radar data in real-time, for example, each hour. Physically based methods, such as a Vertical Profile of Reflectivity (VPR) correction, can be valuable and hold a promise. However, they are not always performed in real-time yet and {{can be difficult to}} implement. The estimation of rainfall using <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> from commercial cellular telephone networks is a new and potentially valuable source of information. Such networks cover large parts of the land surface of the earth and have a high density. The data produced by the <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> in such networks is essentially a by-product of the communication between mobile telephones. Rainfall attenuates the electromagnetic signals transmitted from one telephone tower to another. By measuring the received power at one end of a <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> as a function of time, the path-integrated attenuation due to rainfall can be calculated. Previous studies have shown that average rainfall intensities over the length of a link can be derived from the pathintegrated attenuation. A recent study of us shows that urban rainfall can be estimated from commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data for the Rotterdam region, a densely-populated delta city in the Netherlands. A data set from a commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> network over the Netherlands is analyzed, containing approximately 1500 links covering the land surface of the Netherlands (35500 km 2). This data set consists of several days with extreme rainfall in June, July and August 2011. A methodology is presented to derive rainfall intensities and daily rainfall depths from the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data, which have a temporal resolution of 15 min. The magnitude and dynamics of these rainfall intensities is compared with those obtained from weather radar. Rainfall maps are derived from the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data and are verified against rainfall maps based on gaugeadjusted weather radar data. Although much more work needs to be done, the first results look promising. Since cellular telephone networks are used worldwide, data from such networks could also become a valuable source of rainfall information in countries which do not have continuously operating weather radars, and no or few rain gauges. Apart from rainfall maps which are solely based on <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data, a preliminary analysis will be presented to assess whether commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data can be used to adjust radar rainfall accumulations...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{microwave}} communication {{networks have}} been shown to be valuable tools for rainfall monitoring, based on the well-known Power-Law which relates rain-rate to attenuation in microwave frequencies. However, once precipitation other than pure rain exists (e. g., snow), the Power-Law relation is no longer accurate. In this paper we propose a model which relates the induced attenuation to rain, snow, and sleet. Based on this model we propose estimating the total accumulated precipitation, regardless of the precipitation type, using measurements from multiple <b>microwave</b> <b>links.</b> Our technique takes advantage of the commercial communication networks, need for redundancy, which dictates the use of multiple <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> at the same area. We show that by using measurements from at least three <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> better estimation of the total accumulated precipitation fall can be provided, when rain, snow, sleet, or a mixture of them coexists. To demonstrate the proposed approach, it has been applied on actual <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> attenuation measurements, which were provided by a cellular carrier. The estimation results were compared with Rain-Gauges and disdrometer measurements and show very good agreement and improved accuracy...|$|R
