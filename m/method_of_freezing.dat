40|$|This {{comprehensive}} review describes the effects <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing {{on the physical}} quality parameters of meat. The formation of ice crystals during freezing damages the ultrastructure and concentrates the solutes in the meat which, in turn, leads to alterations in the biochemical reactions that occur at the cellular level and influence the physical quality parameters of the meat. The quality parameters that were evaluated are moisture loss, protein denaturation, lipid and protein oxidation, colour, pH, shear force and microbial spoilage. Additionally mechanisms employed to mitigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing were also reviewed. These include the use <b>of</b> novel <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing, ante and post mortem antifreeze protein inclusion and vitamin E supplementation, brine injection and modified atmospheric packaging.

50|$|Applejack is {{a strong}} {{alcoholic}} beverage made in North America by concentrating cider, either by the traditional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>freeze</b> distillation or by true evaporative distillation. In traditional freeze distillation, a barrel of cider is left outside during the winter. When the temperature is low enough, {{the water in the}} cider starts to freeze. If the ice is removed, the (now more concentrated) alcoholic solution is left behind in the barrel. If the process is repeated often enough, and the temperature is low enough, the alcohol concentration is raised to 20 - 30 % alcohol by volume. Home production of applejack is not illegal in the US, but popular in Europe.|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1950s, the {{logistics}} of producing as many as 6,000 bagels for sale on Sunday morning, in contrast to relatively low activity {{the rest of the}} week, began to demand a solution.

40|$|A {{histological}} {{technique was}} used to evaluate modifications on the microstructure of peach and mango due to classical <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and those produced by high-pressure-shift freezing (HPSF). With the high-pressure-shift method, samples are cooled under pressure (200 MPa) to - 20 Â°C without ice formation, then pressure is released to atmospheric pressure (0. 1 MPa). The high level of supercooling (approximately 20 Â°C) leads to uniform and rapid ice nucleation throughout the volume of the specimen. This method maintained the original tissue structure to a great extent. Since problems associated with thermal gradients are minimized, high-pressure-shift freezing prevented quality losses due to freeze-cracking or large ice crystal presence. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The results show that the construction process of reinforced concrete structure could be simulated well based on perturbation stochastic finite element method.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{comparing}} two traditional <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> drying of enzymes and at verifying the efficiency of each one and their advantages and disadvantages. The experiments were performed with a laboratory spray dryer and freeze-dryer using &# 945;-amylase as the model enzyme. An experimental design in star revealed that spray drying is mainly influenced by the inlet air temperature and feed flow rate, which {{were considered to be}} the main factors influencing the enzymatic activity and water activity; the long period of material exposure to high temperatures causes a partial activity loss. In the experiments <b>of</b> <b>freeze</b> drying, three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> were used (freezer, acetone and dry ice, and liquid nitrogen) and samples subsequently freeze-dried for times ranging between 0 - 24 hours. The product obtained from the two techniques showed high enzymatic activity and low water activity. For the drying of heat-resistant enzymes, in which the product to be obtained does not have high added value, spray drying may be more economically viable because, in the freeze drying process, the process time can be considered as a limiting factor when choosing a technique...|$|R
40|$|Water-washed Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli were {{freeze dried}} in a circulating-gas system at {{atmospheric}} pressure. This convective procedure {{resulted in a}} substantially higher survival of organisms than could be obtained by the vacuum <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>freeze</b> drying. There was little or no decrease in cell viability during convective drying when the residual moisture content was 15 % or higher. Below this level, survival declined with decreasing moisture content. A detailed comparison of the convective and vacuum methods indicated that the advantage gained by freeze drying bacteria in air accrues in the early period of sublimation, at which time cells {{were found to be}} sensitive to vacuum drying but insensitive to air drying. An explanation for this difference is proposed, based upon the kinetics of water removal in the two processes. In brief, it is suggested that the convective method permits samples to be dried more uniformly; and regional over-drying, which may be deleterious even if transient, is thus avoided in achieving the optimal level of moisture...|$|R
