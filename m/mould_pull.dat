60|$|It is well to take, {{if not to}} make, {{a proper}} needle for putting the wicks into the moulds. It should be a hooked piece of wire, like a crochet needle, which catches the wick by its middle and pulls it doubled through the hole. A stick across {{the mouth of the}} mould secures the other end. When the tallow is setting, give an {{additional}} pull downwards. A gun-barrel, with a cork or wad put the required distance down the barrel, has been used for a <b>mould.</b> <b>Pull</b> the candle out by the wick after heating the barrel. Two wads might be used; the one strongly rammed in, to prevent the tallow from running too far, the other merely as a support for the wick. Perhaps, even paper moulds might be used; they could be made by gumming or pasting paper in a roll.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} body {{produced by}} Buchanan was a fibreglass item {{based on an}} Aston Martin DB3-S racing car. Buchanan borrowed a DB3-S and <b>pulled</b> <b>moulds</b> from it while it was in Australia. The styling was altered by filling in the scallops {{either side of the}} bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval. Because the target market was for rebodying of early model MGs, the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches, adding several centimetres to the body length.|$|R
