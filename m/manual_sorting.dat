Method: Anonymized computer {{data from the}} Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) trial (n =  942   031) were analysed using a binary method to assess the accuracy of data on diabetes diagnosis. Diagnostic codes were processed and stratified into: definite, probable and possible diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by using prescription compatibility and temporally sequenced anthropomorphic and biochemical data. Bayesian false detection rate {{analysis was used to}} compare findings with those of an entirely independent and more complex <b>manual</b> <b>sort</b> of the first round QICKD study data (n =  760   588). Results:  The prevalence of definite diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes were 0. 32 % and 3. 27 % respectively when using the binary search method. Up to 35 % of Type 1 diabetes and 0. 1 % of Type 2 diabetes were miscoded or misclassified on the basis of age/BMI and coding. False detection rate analysis demonstrated a close correlation between the new method and the published hand-crafted sort. Both methods had the highest false detection rate values when coding, therapeutic, anthropomorphic and biochemical filters were used (up to 90 % for the new and 75 % for the hand-crafted search method). Conclusions:  A simple computerized algorithm achieves very similar results to more complex search strategies to identify miscoded and misclassified cases of both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It {{has the potential to be}} used as an automated audit instrument to improve quality of diabetes diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Tablet {{production}} {{is a complex}} process. The ultimate goal of pharmaceutical manufacturing is to provide quality products to its end user or the patient. It is explicable that during this manufacturing process some of the tablets may end up with defects. It is mandatory to separate these defective tablets from the high-quality tablets {{in order to ensure}} the safety, quality and efficacy of the tablets. At State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC), sorting of defective tablets are carried out using a <b>manual</b> tablet <b>sorting</b> machine. <b>Manual</b> tablet <b>sorting</b> is a very difficult task, as operators have to keep their eyes on a moving tablet bed all the time and eye is easily fatigued by this. The process is less efficient and does not cost effective. The accuracy and speed of this process exclusively depends on the ability of the operators. Once the operators are fatigue, the whole process is interrupted. The objective of this research project is to upgrade this manual tablet-sorting machine into an automated system with the aim of improving the speed and accuracy of the sorting process. Dark color spots on white colored tablets and color variation among colored tablets are two common defects that can be found in tablets. Therefore, these two defects were considered {{for the purpose of this}} project. Using the newly developed automated tablet-sorting machine, these two defects could be easily identified and separated from a tablet bed. A web camera was used to capture images of moving tablets on conveyor belt, those images were processed and defects on tablets could be extracted from images using basic image processing techniques and mathematical models such as Euclidean distance. After detecting a defective tablet, a pneumatic system was used to separate defective tablet from others. The result shows that system has 100 % accuracy to detect defects, if the defect size is higher than 0. 5 mm. However, the speed cannot be maximized since the web camera used has a lesser speed (30 frames per second) and the programming software does not support to give the results immediately. Although the speed of the automated machine is less than expected, the high accuracy and precision are important. It can reduce the manpower needed and does not depend on the ability of the operator. Use of a high-speed inspection camera and compatible software would increase the speed of the process further...|$|R

The plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address {{automated}} visual inspection of tablets that may, in contrast to <b>manual</b> tablet <b>sorting,</b> provide objective and reproducible tablet quality assurance. Visual inspection of the ever–increasing numbers of the produced imprinted tablets, regulatory enforced for unambiguous identification of active ingredients and dosage strength of each tablet, is especially demanding. The problem becomes more tractable by incorporating some a priori knowledge of the imprint shape and/or appearance. For this purpose, we consider two alternatives, the so-called geometrical and statistical image analysis methods. The geometrical method, incorporating geometrical a priori knowledge of the imprint shape, enables specific inspection of imprinted and non-imprinted tablet surface, while the statistical method exploits a priori knowledge of tablet surface appearance, derived from a training image database. The two methods were evaluated on a large tablet image database, consisting of 3445 images of four types of imprinted tablets, with and without typical production defects. A “gold standard ” for testing the performances of the two inspection methods was established by manually classifying the tablets. The results, obtained by ROC analysis, indicated that statistical method yields better defect detection sensitivity and specificity and is thus more suitable for automatic visual inspection of imprinted tablets. 1...|$|R
