5000|$|Optical storage media, such CD-ROM {{which is}} {{read-only}} (analogous to <b>masked</b> <b>ROM).</b> CD-R is Write Once Read Many (analogous to PROM), while CD-RW supports erase-rewrite cycles (analogous to EEPROM); both {{are designed for}} backwards-compatibility with CD-ROM.|$|E
50|$|The Hitachi 6301 {{processor}} is {{an enhanced}} development {{based on the}} Motorola 6801 implemented in CMOS, {{with a number of}} extra instructions, various hardware system-on-single chip facilities on-chip, power management and support for a sleep state. The particular variant chosen also had 4 KiB of <b>masked</b> <b>ROM</b> on-chip, so an external ROM was not needed on the board.|$|E
50|$|The {{timespan}} {{over which}} a ROM remains accurately readable {{is not limited}} by write cycling. The data retention of EPROM, EAROM, EEPROM, and Flash may be limited by charge leaking from the floating gates of the memory cell transistors. Leakage is accelerated by high temperatures or radiation. <b>Masked</b> <b>ROM</b> and fuse/antifuse PROM do not suffer from this effect, as their data retention depends on physical rather than electrical permanence of the integrated circuit, although fuse re-growth was once a problem in some systems.|$|E
50|$|Some {{integrated}} circuits contain only <b>mask</b> <b>ROM.</b> Other {{integrated circuits}} contain <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> {{as well as}} a variety of other devices. In particular, many microprocessors have <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> to store their microcode. Some microcontrollers have <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> to store the bootloader or all of their firmware.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is its cost. Per bit, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is more compact {{than any other}} kind of semiconductor memory. Since the cost of an integrated circuit strongly depends on its size, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is significantly cheaper than {{any other kind of}} semiconductor memory.|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} {{technologies}} improved {{the flexibility of}} ROM, but at a significant cost-per-chip, so that in large quantities <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> would remain an economical choice for many years. (Decreasing cost of reprogrammable devices had almost eliminated the market for <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> by the year 2000.) Rewriteable technologies were envisioned as replacements for <b>mask</b> <b>ROM.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 8049 has 2 kB of <b>masked</b> <b>ROM</b> {{as well as}} 128 bytes of RAM and 27 I/O ports. The µC's {{oscillator}} block {{divides the}} incoming clock into 15 internal phases, thus with its 11 MHz max. crystal, one gets 0.73 MIPS (of one-clock instructions). Some 70% of instructions are single byte/cycle, but 30% need two cycles and/or two bytes, so raw performance is closer to 0.5 MIPS. The minimum instruction length is 8 bits and the maximum instruction length is 16 bits.|$|E

The µC's oscillator block divides the incoming clock into 15 internal phases, thus with its 11 MHz max. crystal one gets 0.73 MIPS (of one-clock instructions). Some 70% of instructions are single byte/cycle ones, but 30% need two cycles and/or two bytes, so the raw performance would be closer to 0.5 MIPS.|$|E
5000|$|F: Indicates {{a memory}} type or {{specialized}} application. [...] "F" [...] indicating flash memory {{is by far}} the most popular. Other options for memory type include [...] "C" [...] for <b>masked</b> <b>ROM,</b> [...] "FR" [...] for FRAM, [...] "G" [...] for Flash Value Line, and [...] "L" [...] as in the MSP430L09x series, which indicates a RAM-only part; it must remain continuously powered to retain its programming. A second letter (except for [...] "FR") indicates a specialized application for the part. For example, [...] "G" [...] is an optional specialization letter indicating hardware support for a specialized use. [...] "E" [...] indicates special electricity meter functions, [...] "G" [...] devices are designed for medical instrumentation, and [...] "W" [...] devices include a special [...] "scan interface" [...] designed for flow meters.

50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to use rewritable non-volatile memory - such as UV-EPROM or EEPROM - {{for the development}} phase of a project, and to switch to <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> when the code has been finalized.

50|$|The MSP430x3xx Series is {{the oldest}} generation, {{designed}} for portable instrumentation with an embedded LCD controller. This also includes a frequency-locked loop oscillator that can automatically synchronize to a low-speed (32 kHz) crystal. This generation does not support EEPROM memory, only <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> and UV-eraseable and one-time programmable EPROM.

50|$|GI-SP0256 {{refers to}} a family of closely related NMOS LSI chips {{manufactured}} by General Instrument in the early 1980s, able to model the human vocal tract by a software programmable digital filter, creating a digital output converted into an analog signal through an external low pass filter.

5000|$|<b>Mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is {{impractical}} for R&D {{work since}} designers frequently need {{to modify the}} contents of memory as they refine a design.|$|R

5000|$|It is only {{economical}} to buy <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> {{in large}} quantities, since users must {{contract with a}} foundry to produce a custom design.|$|R
50|$|For mask-programmed devices (e.g. gate arrays, mask-programmed single chip microcontrollers, <b>Mask</b> <b>ROMs)</b> a {{three or}} four digit mask number follows the type {{designation}} (e.g. К1801ВП1-014).|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of solid-state ROM {{is as old}} as {{the semiconductor}} technology itself. Combinational logic gates can be joined manually to map -bit address input onto arbitrary values of -bit data output (a look-up table). With the invention of the integrated circuit came <b>mask</b> <b>ROM.</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>ROM</b> consists of a grid of word lines (the address input) and bit lines (the data output), selectively joined together with transistor switches, and can represent an arbitrary look-up table with a regular physical layout and predictable propagation delay.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} microcontrollers used <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> {{to store}} firmware. Later microcontrollers (such {{as the early}} versions of the Freescale 68HC11 and early PIC microcontrollers) had quartz windows that allowed ultraviolet light in to erase the EPROM.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mask</b> <b>ROM</b> (MROM) {{is a type}} of {{read-only}} memory (ROM) whose contents are programmed by the integrated circuit manufacturer (rather than by the user).

5000|$|Nintendo DS games use a {{proprietary}} solid state <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> in their game cards. The <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> chips are manufactured by Macronix {{and have an}} access time of 150 ns. Cards currently range from 8-512 MiB (64 Mib to 4 Gib) in size (although data on the maximum capacity has not been released). Larger cards have a 25% slower data transfer rate than more common smaller cards. The cards usually have {{a small amount of}} flash memory or an EEPROM to save user data such as game progress or high scores. However, there are few games that have no save memory such as Electroplankton. The game cards are 35 x 33 x 3.8 mm (about half the width and depth of Game Boy Advance cartridges) and weigh around 3.5 g ( [...] oz).|$|R
50|$|However, the {{one-time}} masking cost {{is high and}} there is a long turn-around time from design to product phase. Design errors are costly: if an error in the data or code is found, the <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is useless and must be replaced in order to change the code or data.|$|R

50|$|When a device's {{firmware}} {{is stored}} in <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> or one-time programmable PROM, it cannot be modified without physically replacing the integrated circuit, so such a device cannot be field-programmable in the modern sense.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-invasive, half-blind firmware extraction technique that subverts a <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> boot-loader {{in order to}} recover the firmware of a microcon-troller. A stack based buffer overflow is used to forcibly enter the bootloader. Further, a practical method of blind return-oriented programming is presented in which a gadget’s entry point is brute forced, being unknown a priori. In this paper we show that when a software vul-nerability has been found (e. g. by fuzzing), the attacker can locate by brute force the sequences of instructions, gadgets, required for bypassing the protections present in a bootloader. In a half-blind attack, {{the presence of a}} bootloader in <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> helps the attacker in that, while he must still discover blindly a vulnerability in unknown firmware and the appropriate gadgets, he knows the exact contents of the bootloader. ...|$|R
