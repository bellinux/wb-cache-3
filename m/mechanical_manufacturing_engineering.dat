50|$|National Formosa University {{was founded}} in 1980 as Provincial Yunlin Institute of Technology by the Taiwan Provincial Government. Dr. Tien-Chin Chang was {{appointed}} as its first president. Five departments were established: <b>Mechanical</b> and <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering,</b> <b>Mechanical</b> and Materials Engineering, Mechanical Design, Power Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.|$|R
25|$|Education {{in systems}} {{engineering}} {{is often seen}} as an extension to the regular engineering courses, reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background {{in one of the}} traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., aerospace engineering, civil engineering, electrical <b>engineering,</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering,</b> industrial engineering)—plus practical, real-world experience to be effective as systems engineers. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare. Typically, systems engineering is offered at the graduate level in combination with interdisciplinary study.|$|R
50|$|Courses in {{architectural}} conservation, construction management, civil <b>engineering,</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering,</b> electrical engineering, electronics, motorsport technology, music technology, popular music, live event {{technology and}} product design are {{taught at the}} School of Technology. Previously housed at Kedleston Road, the school has now moved, along with the School of Humanities and the School of Art and Design, to the new £21 million Markeaton site, an eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable site with workshops, auditoria, studios, a student shop, a café, an Apple centre and a print bureau.|$|R
