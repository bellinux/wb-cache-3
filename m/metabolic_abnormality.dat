The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> among different PCOS phenotypes, including diabetes mellitus (DM), metabolic syndrome (MS), pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM), insulin resistance (IR) and dyslipidemia were compared. A total of 2436 women who were ≥ 18 years old and who were hospitalized in Sun Yat-Sen University affiliated hospital from 1998 to 2015 in GuangZhou, China, were included in this study. PCOS phenotypes were recorded according to the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, including the polycystic ovary morphology (PCO), hyperandrogenism (HA) and ovulation dysfunction (OD) phenotype (PCO+HA+OD); the ovulation phenotype (PCO+HA); the non-PCO phenotype (HA+OD); and the non-HA phenotype (PCO+OD).

However, limited information exists about the prevalence of this cluster of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in population-based studies. A large cohort of men and women (24, 798 men and 20, 558 women), age 20 - 69, participants in a series of epidcmiological investigations, were pooled. Estimates of the prevalence of Syndrome X and the individual factors comprising this cluster of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were calculated according to gender and age gronps. The majority of participants at baseline presented {{one or more of the}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> ie, elevated blood levels of glucose, triglycerides, high blood pressure, lower levels of high density lipoproteins. However, the prevalence of the full cluster (Syndrome X) of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> was low in the population as a whole, with only 2. 4 % of men and 3. 1 % of women exhibiting the full Syndrome X. These data from a large population-based epidemiological investigation indicate that the presence of a full cluster of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> from Syndrome X is limited. The majority of individuals present elevation in any one or two of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The notion of the cluster of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (Syndrome X) should not distract our attention from established individual risk factors that have been proven to be major causes of cardiovascular death and disability in our society. © 1997, Medikal Press...|$|R
40|$|We {{attempted}} to determine {{sex differences in}} obesity-related <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in a relatively large middle-aged Japanese population. The study population consisted of 2935 men and 1622 women who were 35 to 59 years old. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were determined using the Japanese criteria for metabolic syndrome, and we evaluated the number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> discriminated by waist circumference. In men, {{the mean number of}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> increased as the waist circumference increased. In women, although the mean number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> increased as the waist circumference increased, the mean number was less than 1 even in those with a waist circumference of at least 95 cm. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cutoff levels yielding the maximal sensitivity plus specificity for predicting the prevalence of one or more obesity-related <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were 80 cm in men and 73 cm in women. However, the positive predictive value was as low as 28. 8 % in men and 7. 1 % in women, which may not be suitable for a screening test, especially in women. Middle-aged Japanese women seem to be resistant to obesity-induced <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and waist circumference would not effectively predict the existence of metabolic syndrome. In setting the cutoff points in guidelines, a greater emphasis should be placed on the absolute risk of having abnormalities or diseases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The PCC is {{commonly}} affected by neurodegenerative disease. In fact, reduced metabolism in the PCC {{is an early}} sign of Alzheimer's disease, and is frequently present before a clinical diagnosis. The reduced metabolism in the PCC is typically one part in a diffuse pattern of metabolic dysfunction in the brain that includes medial Temporal lobe structures and the anterior thalamus, and these metabolic abnormalities {{may be due to}} damage in isolated but connected regions. For instance, Meguro et al. (1999) show that experimental damage of the rhinal cortex results in hypometabolism of the PCC. In Alzheimer's disease, the <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormality</b> is linked to Amyloid deposition and brain Atrophy with a spatial distribution that resembles the nodes of the Default mode network (DMN). In early Alzheimer's, the functional connectivity within the DMN is reduced and affects the connection between the PCC and the hippocampus, and these altered patterns can reflect ApoE genetic status (a risk factor associated with the disease). It has been found that neurodegenerative diseases spread 'prion-like' through the brain. For example, when the proteins amyloid-b and TDP-43 are in their abnormal form, they spread trans-synaptically and are associated with Neurodegeneration. This transmission of abnormal protein would be constrained by the organization of white matter connections and could potentially explain the spatial distribution of Alzheimer's pathology within the DMN. In Alzheimer’s disease, the topology of white matter connectivity helps in predicting atrophic patterns, which could explain why the PCC is affected {{in the early stages of}} the disease.|$|E

In collaboration with Samuel Gurin at the University of Pennsylvania, Brady discovered the enzyme system for the biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids, and later discovered the role of malonate coenzyme A in this process. After two and one-half years on active duty in the U.S. Naval Medical Corps, he joined the National Institutes of Health in 1954. He was Chief of the Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 1972 to 2006. Dr. Brady and his colleagues identified the enzymatic defects in Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease and the specific <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormality</b> in Tay-Sachs disease. He and his associates developed diagnostic, carrier detection, prenatal tests for these conditions, and effective enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher disease and Fabry disease.

40|$|The {{derangements}} in energy/substrate metabolism seen in oncology {{patients are}} similar {{regardless of the}} tumor's site of origin, and in advanced disease these metabolic derangements can be manifested as cancer cachexia. The relationship between tumor size {{and the degree of}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormality,</b> however, remains unclear. Using primed constant infusions of stable and radiolabeled isotopes and indirect calorimetry, the authors have determined the rates of net protein catabolism (NPC), glucose oxidation, Cori cycling of glucose, and oxygen consumption in 85 patients with cancer. They have assessed the association between bulk of tumor and <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormality</b> using regression analysis. A positive correlation was found between tumor bulk and the rates of NPC (r 2 = 0. 8), plasma glucose appearance (r 2 = 0. 72), plasma glucose clearance (r 2 = 0. 70), the percentage of tissue glucose uptake recycled to lactate (r 2 = 0. 62), and oxygen consumption (r 2 = 0. 79). The percentage of tissue glucose uptake oxidized was negatively correlated with tumor bulk (r 2 = 0. 75). The data indicate that the degree of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormality</b> seen in cancer patients is closely related to the quantity of malignant tissue present. Progressive increase in tumor size is associated with an increase in peripheral substrate mobilization, an increase in the rate of hepatic glucose production, an increase in tissue glucose uptake, an increase in energy-expensive glucose cycling to lactate, and an increase in protein loss...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that preserved muscle mass is protective against obesity-associated insulin resistance and <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> we analyzed the relationship of lean body mass and computed tomography-assessed sectional areas of specific skeletal muscles with insulin resistance and <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in a healthy cohort. Methods: A total of 195 subjects without diabetes who had completed a medical examination were included in this study. Various anthropometric indices such as circumferences of the arm, waist, hip, thigh, and calf were measured. Body composition (fat and lean body mass) was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Sectional areas of specific skeletal muscles (iliopsoas, erector spinae, gluteus, femoris, and rectus abdominis muscles) were measured using computed tomography. Findings: Fat and lean body mass were significantly correlated with <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and insulin resistance indices. When adjusted by weight, relationships of fat and lean body mass with metabolic parameters were mirror images of each other. The weight-adjusted lean body mass negatively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures; fasting plasma glucose, HbA 1 c, alanine aminotransferase, and triglyceride, and insulin levels; and hepatic insulin resistance indices, and positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol levels and muscle insulin sensitivity indices. Compared with weight-adjusted lean body mass, weight-adjusted sectional areas of specific skeletal muscles showed similar, but not as strong, correlations with metabolic parameters. Among anthropometric measures, the calf circumference best reflected lean body mass, and weight-adjusted calf circumference negatively correlated with <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and insulin resistance indices. Interpretation: Weight-adjusted lean body mass and skeletal muscle area are protective against weight-associated insulin resistance and <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The calf circumference reflects lean body mass and may be useful as a protective marker against obesity-associated <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities...</b>|$|R

In this 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, metformin at 500 mg/d or 1000 mg/d was prescribed to clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia who had pre-existing <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The recruited patients underwent physical and laboratory evaluations at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The outcomes were any changes in metabolic traits. Among the 96 clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia screened for the trial, 55 patients with pre-existing <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 18), metformin dosage at 500 mg/d (n = 18), and metformin dosage at 1000 mg/d (n = 19) groups. The body weight (BW) of patients in the metformin 1000 mg/d group significantly decreased, by a mean of 0. 97 kg over the 12 week trial period. Moreover, patients in the metformin at 500 mg/d and 1000 mg/d groups had a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) after 12 weeks, with the mean decrease being 0. 70 and 0. 50 kg/m 2, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the other metabolic parameters of patients in the three groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients with {{schizophrenia}} are at {{high risk}} of developing <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Method A prospective study focusing on metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia, including an oral glucose tolerance test, is currently ongoing at our University Hospital and affiliate services. The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> at baseline was assessed in a cohort of 415 patients with schizophrenia. The sample was divided into 4 groups according to duration of illness: first-episode patients (20 years). Results <b>Metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were already present in first-episode patients, and considerably increased with increasing duration of illness. When compared to the general population matched for age and gender, much higher rates of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes were observed for patients with schizophrenia. For MetS, the increase over time was {{similar to that of the}} general population. In contrast, the difference in the prevalence of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia and the general population dramatically and linearly increased from 1. 6 % in the 15 – 25 age-band to 19. 2 % in the 55 – 65 age-band. Conclusion Thus, the current data suggest that on the one hand <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> are an inherent part of schizophrenic illness, as they are already present in first-episode patients. On the other hand, however, our results suggest a direct effect of the illness and/or antipsychotic medication on their occurence.

Hormones have direct impacts on systemic metabolism, which in turn, may affect the progression of PA. Nowadays, conventional therapeutic strategies for PA do not include modalities of adjusting whole-body metabolism, which is most likely due to the current consideration of the aberrant whole-body metabolism of PA patients as a passive associated symptom and not involved in PA progression. Because systemic <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> are presented by 22. 3 %– 52. 5 % PA patients and are closely correlated with disease progression and prognosis, we propose that assessment of metabolic status should be emphasized during the treatment of PA and that control of <b>metabolic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> should be added into the current therapies for PA.
