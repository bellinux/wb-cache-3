60|$|Whether {{each of the}} innumerable {{autonomous}} {{elements of}} the body is a cell or the <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> of a cell, is a more doubtful question, even if so wide a definition be given to the term, as to include cell-like bodies without walls and without nuclei. (27/40. For the most recent classification of cells, see Ernst Hackel 'Generelle Morpholog.' b. 2 1866 s. 275.) The doctrine of omnis cellula e cellula is admitted for plants, and widely prevails with respect to animals. (27/41. Dr. W. Turner 'The Present Aspect of Cellular Pathology' 'Edinburgh Medical Journal' April 1863.) Thus Virchow, the great supporter of the cellular theory, whilst allowing that difficulties exist, maintains that every atom of tissue is derived from cells, and these from pre-existing cells, and these primarily from the egg, which he regards as a great cell. That cells, still retaining the same nature, increase by self-division or proliferation, is admitted by every one. But when an organism undergoes great changes of structure during development, the cells, which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from previously existing cells, must likewise be greatly changed in nature; this change is attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to some inherent power which the cells possess, and not to any external agency. Others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be formed, independently of pre-existing cells, from plastic lymph or blastema. Whichever view may be correct, every one admits that the body consists of a multitude of organic units, all of which possess their own proper attributes, and are to a certain extent independent of all others. Hence it will be convenient to use indifferently the terms cells or organic units, or simply units.|$|E

50|$|In 1873 due to {{requests}} from his clients and dissatisfaction {{with his own}} imported range in his home Shacklock designed and built a prototype cast iron coal range. Shacklock built a ‘self setting’ stove with specially designed grates and flues that worked using lignite coal unlike the British and American kitset imports which were designed to run on bituminous coal. This design was a continually improved and <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> that warmed kitchens, heated water, baked scones and cooked porridge throughout thousands of New Zealand homes. Shacklock named his design the ‘Orion’ due to his interest in astronomy. Before he patented the range in 1882 he introduced many features {{to appeal to the}} potential customer. The curves and angles were designed for aesthetics as well as strength. The fire doors would stay open by themselves horizontally, the chimney and flue damper could be removed for cleaning and the door was also made with varying thicknesses to distribute the heat evenly. By the late 1880s, the Orion range grew to include many different models including double ovens and featuring a ‘destructor’ firebox that was advertised as a safe and hygienic way of disposing of kitchen waste.|$|E
40|$|During the {{transport}} of iron as ferrichrome complex into cells of Escherichia coli K- 12, the ligand was modified and excreted into the medium. The rate {{of the formation of}} the <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> corresponded with the rate of iron transport. The <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> showed a decreased affinity for ferric iron and did not serve as an effective iron ionophore. After all of the ferrichrome had been converted, the <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> was taken up into the cell in an iron-free form. The uptake of ferrichrome and of the <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> depended on {{the transport}} system specified by the tonA and tonB genes. The <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> could be converted back into ferrichrome by mild acid or alkaline hydrolysis. One mole of acetate was released per mole of ferrichrome. It is proposed that one N-hydroxyl group of ferrichrome is acetylated to explain the low affinity for iron as the N-hydroxyl groups form the ligands for iron (III). A weak ester linkage by which the acetyl group is covalently bonded would account for the easy hydrolysis. The iron-free form of ferrichrome, deferri-ferrichrome, was also rapidly converted when incubated with cells with a functional transport system. It is therefore likely that iron is released from ferrichrome by reduction before modification takes place. The conversion of the ligand could be a mechanism by which cells rid themselves of a potentially deleterious ligand for iron in the cytoplasm. A possible role in ferrichrome transport is discussed...|$|E
