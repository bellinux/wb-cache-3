In this paper, well organized BTO {{system in the}} sanitary materials manufacturer is seek {{with the aid of}} high accuracy demand forecasting, which is newly developed by us. Focusing that the equation of ESM is equivalent to (1, 1) order ARMA model equation, a new method of estimation of smoothing constant in ESM was derived. Trend removal method was also devised. AR model is also used for forecasting. After removing trend, AR model is utilized and forecasting is executed. Better one in the forecasting accuracy between them was chosen for the final forecasting. Thus, we could obtain the high accuracy demand forecasting. These methods are examined by the data of sanitary materials manufacturer and the BTO system is newly built by utilizing this method. Further development of this system should be performed hereafter.

40|$|There is an {{impressive}} body of empirical evidence which indicates {{the existence of an}} intraday U-shaped curve in stock prices. In an effort to shed additional light on the U-shaped curve a new procedure for U-shape testing is introduced. From careful analysis of intraday data it is observed that minimum or maximum stock prices can occur several times during the day. Here, attention is focused on the first time during the day that the maximum or <b>minimum</b> <b>stock</b> price occurred. Because {{of the importance of the}} first time during the day that the maximum or <b>minimum</b> <b>stock</b> price occurred, an attempt is made to model these two characteristics with probability distributions. The objective of this study is to use a generalized beta distribution to examine the intradaily behaviour of stocks, using closing stock prices for each one-minute interval, using data from Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). This generalized beta distribution has not been used before to model U-shaped behaviour. The results are consistent with the intraday U-shaped curves, i. e. the time to first maximum (or <b>minimum)</b> <b>stock</b> prices follows a U-shaped pattern. In addition, some potential applications of the generalized beta distribution are discussed and exemplified by analysing the relationship between herd behaviour and U-shaped. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{single-stage}} production-inventory system produces {{parts in}} a make-to-stock mode, and unsatisfied demand is backordered. The system operates under a so-called base stock with WIP cap replenishment policy, which works as follows. Whenever the Work-In-Process (WIP) plus finished goods inventory falls below a specified level, called base stock, a replenishment {{order for the}} production of a new part is issued. If the WIP inventory is below a different specified level, called WIP cap, the order goes through and a new part is released for production; otherwise, the order is put on hold until the WIP inventory drops below the WIP cap. First, it is shown that the optimal base stock that minimizes the long-run, average, inventory holding cost for a given minimum customer service level, is a non-increasing function of the WIP cap that reaches a minimum value, called <b>minimum</b> optimal base <b>stock,</b> at a finite WIP cap value, called critical WIP cap. Then, it is shown that the optimal WIP cap is {{less than or equal to}} the critical WIP cap and therefore the optimal base stock is greater than or equal to the <b>minimum</b> optimal base <b>stock.</b> More interestingly, however, it is conjectured that the optimal WIP cap is in fact exactly equal to the critical WIP cap and therefore the optimal base stock is exactly equal to the <b>minimum</b> optimal base <b>stock.</b> The <b>minimum</b> optimal base <b>stock</b> is none other than the optimal base stock of the same system operating under a classical base stock policy (with no WIP cap).

Citramart Minimarket as a retail business has not yet been used that grouping and consideration in their sales information system for processing their item's <b>minimum</b> <b>stock</b> level and profit margin. The process is still done manually by arbitrary observations from a stock division staff. The categories that is used to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>stock</b> and profit margin are also not the moving speed of item but rather the kind of items. This study aim to support the process of determining the <b>minimum</b> <b>stock</b> and profit margin by building a model that can group items into categories ‘fast moving’ and slow moving’ using k-means clustering. K-means clustering is used in this study because the number of clusters required in categorization of items already set. The group cluster which has highest centroid will be the fast moving group, while the lowest centroid is the slow moving group. The data {{to be used in the}} research is taken from sales data for year 2014 and 2015. The clustering scenario uses combination of time, e. g. yearly and monthly, and variable, e. g. count of items and their transaction values. Using 3 clusters and delta value 0. 2, the resulting best scenario is using yearly time and transaction value variable.
