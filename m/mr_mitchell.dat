500|$|Phil Hogan of Fine Gael, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, {{attacked}} Martin McGuinness {{claiming that}} US multinational companies would be [...] "appalled" [...] if Martin McGuinness were elected and {{foreign direct investment}} would drop. This {{was followed by a}} tweet made by Government Chief Whip Paul Kehoe which claimed that McGuinness profited from the Northern Bank robbery. This was in response to a pledge made by McGuinness to only take the average industrial wage, if elected President. McGuinness dismissed both charges as [...] "black propaganda". It was reported in The Irish Times that Fine Gael's [...] "strategy of levelling strongly worded accusations at Mr McGuinness was part of a drive to motivate party voters to come out in support of <b>Mr</b> <b>Mitchell</b> in the October 27th election".|$|E
500|$|Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave a warm review, {{calling it}} [...] "inspired" [...] and {{comparing}} {{the work to}} other successful recent Broadway musicals: [...] "Like The Full Monty (choreographed by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell)</b> and Billy Elliot the Musical, it {{is set in a}} hard-times British factory town, where jobs are in jeopardy and spirits need lifting. Like La Cage aux Folles and Priscilla Queen of the Desert, it presents drag queens as the show’s official spirit lifters. And like Hairspray, the musical this production most resembles in tone, Kinky Boots is about finding your passion, overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes." [...] Brantley wrote that Lauper's [...] "love- and heat-seeking score" [...] wowed with her [...] "trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity", and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for [...] "big red scene stealers". He also praised “Raise You Up/Just Be,” as [...] "one of the best curtain numbers since 'You Can’t Stop the Beat' sent Hairspray audiences dancing out of the theater.” Brantley, however, did not extend his praise to Fierstein's script, writing that his [...] "sticky, sermonizing side" [...] comes through in the second half, where [...] "all the clichés stand naked before you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Rachel {{talked to}} them about the F. U. E. E., and was delighted by the flush of eager {{interest}} on Mrs. Mitchell's thin face. [...] "Objects" [...] swarmed in their parish, but where were the seven shillings per week to come from? At any rate <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell</b> would, the first leisure day, come over to St. Herbert's with her, and inspect. He did not fly off at the first hint of Mr. Mauleverer's [...] "opinions," [...] but said he would talk to him, and thereby rose steps untold in Rachel's estimation. The fact of change is dangerously pleasant to the human mind; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell</b> walked at once into popularity, and Lady Temple had almost conferred a public benefit by what she so little liked to remember. At any rate she had secured an unexceptionable companion, and many a time resorted to his wing, leaving Bessie to amuse Lord Keith, who seemed to be reduced to carry on his courtship to the widow by attentions to her guest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of another thing. I never heard of an {{industrial}} school where the great want was not food for industry. Now I know the Colonel and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell</b> have some notion floating in their minds about getting a house for convalescents down here, and {{it strikes me that}} this might supply the work in cooking, washing, and so on. I think I might try what they thought of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I do, I am {{the only}} pebble {{on the shore of}} time that does or will," [...] {{retorted}} the unreal editor. [...] "But he wrote you for only two months. I well remember what a pleasure he had in it. And he knew how to make his readers share his pleasure! Still, it was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell</b> who invented you, and it was Curtis who characterized you beyond all the rest." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Mitchell</b> {{said she}} {{supposed}} he might, {{and then she}} cuffed young Ted's ears for making a noise while 'e was eating, and then cuffed 'im agin for saying that he'd finished 'is supper five minutes ago.|$|R

60|$|Rachel did not dwell {{much on the}} subject, it {{was only}} the climax of conceit, croquet, and mere womanhood; and she was chiefly anxious to know whether <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> the {{temporary}} clergyman, would support the F. U. E. E., and be liberal enough to tolerate Mr. Mauleverer. She had great hopes from a London incumbent, and, besides, Bessie Keith knew him, and spoke of him as a very sensible, agreeable, earnest man.|$|E
60|$|I {{am sorry}} to say that I am {{not one of the}} Zoologicals, or I should have been delighted to have had a hand in the {{introduction}} of a child to the lions and tigers.

60|$|Indeed the {{military}} society was soon in better odour with her than the clerical. She {{had been making}} strenuous efforts to get to St. Herbert's, with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> for some time past, but the road {{was in a state}} of being repaired, and the coachman was determined against taking his horses there. As to going by train, that was equally impossible, since he would still less have driven her to the station, finally, Rachel took the resolute stop of borrowing Fanny's pony carriage, and driving herself and the clergyman to the station, where she was met by Mrs. Morris, the mother of one of the girls, to whom she had promised such a visit, as it had been agreed that it would be wisest not to unsettle the scholars by Christmas holidays.|$|E
