30|$|The {{most popular}} {{mechanism}} for ferromagnetic order in DMO is the bound magnetic polaron (BMP) where a trapped electron {{at the site}} of the VO, with a hydrogenic radius (0.4 to 0.6  nm), intercepts and polarizes the magnetic moment from 3 d ions creating ferromagnetic order. Percolation of such BMPs creates a spin-polarized impurity band. The polarization of this band depends on the energetic overlapping with the spin split 3 d bands of the cation. This is a reason which holds that no ferromagnetism would be expected for certain systems such as SnO 2 : Sc, Ti, and Zn [3] or ZnO: Cr [11]. On the other hand, ferromagnetism evidence on SnO 2 :Zn nanorods [12] was recently reported. It was proposed that substitutional Zn induced the formation of Sni defects to which is attributed the magnetic moment. This model is reinforced by theoretical calculations carried out by several groups [13, 14]. The model used to refer the origin of magnetism based on interstitial cations is named BMP’ [15].

It {{can be found}} that the stress distribution pattern of nano-scale polycrystalline machining is overall consistent with that of conventional machining, {{as well as that}} of nano-scale machining of <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structures</b> [20, 31]. For all the cases, the stress concentration is observed in the primary shear zone, where the chip is formed by high-strain-rate shearing in the primary shear zone, as well as the second shear zone, which is the friction-affected zone between the tool rake face and the chip. For each case, the maximum stress occurs at the primary shear zone and it increases as the depth of cut increases. For instance, at the tool travel distance of 240  Å, the maximum equivalent stress values are 41.7, 42.7, and 43.6  GPa for cases C 10, C 4, and C 11, respectively. Meanwhile, our results indicate that the equivalent stress on grain boundaries is generally 30 % to 60 % higher than the stress inside the grains. Note that the difference of equivalent stresses on grain boundaries and inside the grains is not only caused by the exertion of cutting force. It is believed that the crystallographic orientation of grains could introduce stress concentration on and nearby boundaries. The literature also indicates that a higher amount of stress and lattice distortion can develop nearby the grain boundaries [32].|$|R

The primary CuO nanoparticles are linked by the G 2 Td(COOH) (16) dendrimer. This method provides a way to preserve the original properties of primary CuO nanoparticles in the ordered hybrid nanomaterials by using the 3 D rigid polyphenylene dendrimer (G 2 Td(COOH) (16)) as a space isolation. The primary CuO nanoparticles with diameter of (6. 3 +/- 0. 4) nm are synthesized via four successive reaction steps starting from the rapid reduction of Cu(NO 3) (2) by using NaBH 4 as reducer and G 2 Td(COOH) 16 as surfactant. The obtained hybrid CuO-G 2 Td(COOH) (16) RSA, formed in the last reaction step, possesses a crystal structure analogous to a monocrystal as observed by transmission electron microscopy(TEM). In particular, the formation process of the RSA is monitored by UV-vis, TEM, and X-ray diffraction.

30|$|Existing {{studies on}} MD {{simulation}} of nano-scale machining usually adopt defect-free monocrystalline structures {{as the work}} material [19]. The most popular ones have been monocrystal copper, aluminum, and silicon. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of}} engineering materials exist in polycrystalline (instead of monocrystalline) forms. It is not difficult to understand that machining polycrystalline structures may yield different results compared with machining monocrystalline structures. Moreover, the grain size in polycrystalline structures is often a controlling factor for material properties and material responses to deformation. It is important to investigate how it impacts the machining performance at nano/atomistic scale. In a preliminary study, Shi and Verma [20] constructed one polycrystalline copper structure, simulated nano-scale machining of the structure, and made a comparison with monocrystalline machining. It was discovered that for all cutting conditions simulated, the polycrystalline structure requires smaller cutting forces compared with the <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structure.</b> This result might be expected as the existence of grain boundary is usually regarded as defects, and thus, it reduces material strength. However, many more interesting questions arise from the preliminary finding, such as ‘Will the polycrystalline structures with different grain sizes behave differently in nano-scale machining?’, ‘What are the roles of grain boundaries in measured machining performances?’, and ‘How do the machining parameters affect the performances of nano-scale polycrystalline machining?’ In an effort to answer these research questions, we carry out this study.|$|E

Morphological and structural characterizations, carried out by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, indicated a TiO 2 rutile <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structure</b> of the nanowires. An in situ thermal growth analysis was performed by means of an environmental electron microscope, providing additional insights into the TiO 2 NWs growth dynamics.

TiO 2 NWs revealed a 70 % improvement of the degradation rate compared to a reference TiO 2 bulk sample. Moreover, NWs were additionally annealed in forming gas (5 % H 2 in N 2) in order to promote the formation of oxygen vacancies and an increase of the carrier density. Indeed, the photocatalytic activity of the NWs treated in forming gas was 3 times higher than that of the reference TiO 2 bulk sample. The photonic efficiency and the quantum efficiency, also showed an increase versus bulk TiO 2 of about 20 % in the presence of NWs, and of about 100 % with the forming gas annealing. Moreover, this increase in the photocatalytic activity after the forming gas annealing also correlates with the disappearance of a deep level recombination center as observed by deep level transient spectroscopy...|$|E

The U 4 f and O 1 s core-electron peak intensities {{as well as the}} U 5 f relative intensity before and after the ¹²⁹Xe²³⁺ and ²³⁸U³¹⁺ irradiations were employed. It was found that the presence of uranium dioxide film in air results in formation of oxide UO₂₊ₓ on the surface with mean oxygen coefficients ko in the range 2. 07 - 2. 11 on LSAT and 2. 17 - 2. 23 on YSZ substrates. These oxygen coefficients depend on the substrate and weakly on the crystallographic orientation. On the basis of the spectral parameters it was established that uranium dioxide films AP 2, 3 on the LSAT substrates have the smallest ko values, and from the XRD and EBSD results it follows that these samples have a regular <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structure.</b> The XRD and EBSD results indicate that samples AP 5 - 7 on the YSZ substrates have monocrystalline structure; however, they have the highest ko values. The observed difference in the ko values was probably caused by the different nature of the substrates: the YSZ substrates provide 6. 4 % compressive strain, whereas (001) LSAT substrates result only in 0. 03 % tensile strain in the UO₂ films. ¹²⁹Xe²³⁺ irradiation (92 MeV, 4. 8 × 10 ¹⁵ ions/cm²) of uranium dioxide films on the LSAT substrates was shown to destroy both long-range ordering and uranium close environment, which results in an increase of uranium oxidation state and regrouping of oxygen ions in uranium close environment. ²³⁸U³¹⁺ (110 MeV, 5 × 10 ¹⁰, 5 × 10 ¹¹, 5 × 10 ¹² ions/cm²) irradiations of uranium dioxide films on the YSZ substrates were shown to form the lattice damage only with partial destruction of the long-range ordering.

Hence, research on finite-dimensional systems strive to unearth and expand the knowledge of fundamental physical properties in certain key materials which exhibit numerous concurrent and exploitable functions. Correspondingly, ferroelectric nanostructures, which particularly display a plethora of complex phenomena, prevalent in countless fields of research, are noteworthy candidates. Presently, however, the assimilation of zero-(0 D) and one-dimensional (1 D) ferroelectric into micro- or nano-electronics has been lagging, in part {{due to a lack of}} applied and fundamental studies but also due to the paucity of synthetic strategies yielding high quality <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structures.</b> In this work, the problematics of size reduction, which affects many aspects of electronic devices, was addressed. Furthermore, the depolarizing effects associated with finite thickness in ferroelectric nanostructures was investigated in connection with other crucial boundary conditions. The work reported in this dissertation concerned isolated 0 D and 1 D BaTiO 3 nanocrystals and nanocomposites composed of periodic arrays of BaTiO 3 nanowires embedded in a matrix formed by another ferroelectric material. A systematic investigation was conducted for those three types of nanostructures from a quantum mechanical and atomistic perspective using both direct-first-principles and first-principles-derived methods. Using first-principles-based calculations, the structural phase sequences in 0 D (cubic-to-tetragonal-to-monoclinic-to-rhombohedral) and 1 D (cubic-to-tetragonal-to-orthorhombic-to-monoclinic) BaTiO 3 nanoparticles revealed differences from that of the bulk and thin film systems. The monoclinic symmetry found in the 0 D compounds, and as for the ground-state of 1 D systems, were also affected by size effects and tuned by varying parameters related to the depolarizing effect. Strong electromechanical responses characteristic to the monoclinic symmetry, were also found. In addition, by partially screening the uncompensated charges at the surface of the nanodots, a small range existed (∼ 87 % to ∼ 95 % screening) where both the polarization and toroidal moment coexisted within the nanoparticles. Ferroelectric $nanocomposites$ are novel systems that were also examined and were found to exhibit completely original properties not yet observed in either constituents alone. The temperature-dependent properties such as the structural phases and behavior of the polarization within these nanocomposites were obtained. Interesting new features related to flux-closure configurations were discovered. Transitions associated with the cores of electric dipole vortices were correlated to the direction of in-plane polarization. In addition, vortex-antivortex pairs in a peculiar phase-locked configuration were ascertained in these structures. Complementary density-functional theory calculations were also performed for BaTiO 3 nanowires with dissociated-water adsorbates as a function of the out-of-plane lattice constant. Topological defects with winding numbers ranging from 1 to - 3 were found in the water-covered nanowires. The ground-state was found to be of triclinic symmetry. Ab-initio calculations were also performed for nanocomposites to investigate the electronic properties of the phase-locked configuration. Similarly to the Monte-Carlo simulations, a configuration containing both vortices (not localized in the nanowires though) and antivortices was found to be the ground state. Mastery of nanomaterials requires merging theoretical research with experimental observation, hence a synthesis project was developed to obtain BaTiO 3 nano-tubes and wires using direct pore filling of nanoporous templates. The preliminary results suggested the synthesis of polycrystalline nanostructures depend on the template pore surface polarity and size. The results presented in this dissertation suggested that ferroelectric nanostructures continue to be of great fundamental value and may substantially impact advancement in certain technologies.

The HERCULES strategy is to transfer the developed processes to industrial scale by considering all major cost drivers of the entire manufacturing process chain. The final objective is to obtain both high-efficiency solar cells and modules, based on adequately simple process sequences. It requires strong expertise and equipment mastering in order to provide a commercially viable technology that can be implemented by the European PV industry. To this end, the HERCULES consortium takes advantage of its leading European expertise in both research and production. In this paper, major results are presented concerning the first 30 months in material, solar cell development, module integration and pilot line activity. The strong improvements achieved in all the value chain demonstrate the strong need of collaboration within all partners to reach very ambitious objectives from the optimization of n-type solar cells & modules up to production level.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of material self-assembling and self-organization mechanisms, at mesoscale, {{is crucial for}} nanotechnologies development. Such structures, hierarchically organized in superlattices or colloïdal crystals, are observed in inorganic or organo-metallic precipitates. The classical characterization, using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, of a synthesized powder is inadequate to describe the hierarchically organized polycrystalline structure of the final particles. Here, we have highlighted the successive steps {{that lead to the}} spontaneous formation of a cobalt oxalate dihydrate (COD) colloïdal crystals that precipitate in aqueous media. The characterization of the final particles, made by X-ray and electronic diffraction, has allowed us to determine the controversial crystalline phase of the precipitated COD. The β and γ COD phases has been discriminated by comparing experimental results with simulations of X-ray diffractogram and electron diffraction patterns for these both structures. The precipitated COD corresponds to the γ phase indicating that it comes from solid dehydration of cobalt oxalate tetrahydrate. The final powder characterization, performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), low voltage high resolution scanning electron microscopy (LVHRSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gives some diverging results about monocrystalline or polycrystalline nature of the precipitates. XRD and AFM analysis show a polycrystalline structure of particles whereas LVHRSEM, TEM and electron diffraction observations indicate a <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structure.</b> This apparent contradiction has led us to elaborate a new characterization method allowing to follow the growth and the structural evolution of the precipitate as a function of time. The cryo- preparation techniques are well adapted as they allow freezing and direct observation of solid state suspension by electron microscopy. The freeze/drying method has been modified and used for both SEM and TEM, and has allowed us to study the morphological and structural evolution of the COD precipitate from nanoscale to mesoscale. In addition, TEM analysis of samples prepared by classical techniques has been performed to complement cryo-electron microscopy observations. The combination of these two methods show that COD precipitation is a complex multi-step process leading to the formation of a core/shell heterostructure. The anisotropic core is porous and partially crystalline. It is formed by agglomeration of isolated primary particles and agregated ones (15 - 20 nm sized secondary particles). The crystalline shell corresponds to the final particles faces and is made up by the layer by layer self-assembling and alignment of 5 - 7 nm sized crystalline primary particles. These nanoparticles are aligned and perfectly ordered in strings of nanograins in the layer structure. The self-assembling occurs in the last step of growth where we have a lower ionic strength and supersaturation inducing slower kinetics of growth and aggregation. Moreover, the crystalline order in the primary and secondary particles increase with the time of reaction consistent with a continuous process of primary particle nucleation and growth. Our results show that self-assembling occurs layer by layer with terraces, kinks and steps that are present on the faces. This reminds the layer by layer crystalline growth models but in this case, the buiding blocks are colloïdal instead of atomic or molecular. Based on these different results, we propose an original model describing the COD precipitate growth. In addition, we have studied the poly(methacrylic acid-sodium salt) effect on the COD precipitation. This additive (PMMA) appeared {{to be a very good}} growth inhibitor. The PMMA effect on the final particles morphology is dramatic. Its concentration variation in solution slows down the nanoparticles aggregation rates along a [101] preferential direction. The crystal habit can then be controlled and we have synthesized platelets, cubes and rods with tailored length. The use of cryogenic electron microscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool for the {{understanding of}} time dependent aspects of particle growth. The use of such techniques for the study of other systems, where the final precipitate appearance may hide particle substructures, will help to elucidate growth mechanisms and allow finer control of nanostructured materials for many applications. The complex self-assembling and self-organization processes could then be highlighted and studied on a nanometer to micrometer scale...|$|E
30|$|For {{almost two}} decades, the largest parts of silicon {{nanostructures}} {{that have been}} performed were porous silicon (pSi) using silicon wafers as a starting material. In recent years, the attention of several researchers and industrials has been gradually swerved from pSi to silicon nanowires (SiNWs). Indeed, SiNWs show noticeable advantages. Due to their good <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>structure</b> and electrical properties, SiNWs have been broadly explored for nanoscale electronic devices[1, 2]. Microstructured silicon in wire shape is a good candidate to replace carbon lithium-ion batteries. SiNWs {{would be able to}} overcome problems caused by huge volume expansion during lithiation, enabling larger capacity and longer stability[3, 4]. In addition to the excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility of silicon dioxide[5, 6], SiNWs exhibit a relatively high surface-to-volume ratio. Hence, they could be readily oxidized and then functionalized with various biochemicals through different linkage chemistries. These properties have stimulated intensive researches attempting to evaluate the performance of SiNWs as biosensors and drug delivery systems[7, 8]. It has been shown that porous SiNWs exhibit visible light emission and the luminescence is likely to be related to their porosity[9, 10]. Improved NW porosity results in enhanced PL. Various synthetic methods have been reported to produce SiNWs. Bottom-up SiNWs are nearly totally grown from a high-purity silicon substrate for specific use in microelectronics and photonics. The bottom-up technique is expensive because it is time consuming and needs multistep fabrication and vacuum reactors (CVD, PLD, etc.)[11]. Even though metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) is a top-down technique, which is rapid, simple, and of low cost, it relies on noble metal nanoparticles acting as catalysts in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions with an oxidant agent such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Highly localized successive Si oxidation and etching take place underneath the metal nanoparticles. The etching procedure leads to the formation of a wirelike structure with a diameter close to that of the metal nanoparticle. SiNW morphology is affected by many factors such as the type of the semiconductor, orientation of the substrate, concentration of the oxidant, etching temperature, and etching time. Several papers and reviews reported the effect of those parameters and exposed in detail the methods as well as the chemical mechanisms that explain SiNW formation[12 – 15]. SiNWs sculpted in Si substrates may be collected by lift-off technique or by scratching the wires with a sharp blade followed by an additional grinding to obtain photosensitive nanoparticles. This method is simple but has a dramatically low output. To meet the huge demand of nanostructured silicon, a growing number of research teams are active to find new strategies and develop high-output batch processing capable of producing nanostructured silicon powder in quantities allowing upscaling to industrial demands[16 – 18]. So far, a low-cost and scalable method of silicon nanowire production remains a major challenge. This work is aiming to contribute to addressing this challenge. First, we chose silicon powder as the feedstock starting material instead of upgraded silicon wafers. This allows reducing nearly tenfold the price of the starting material. Practically, almost all SiNWs grown by the top-down approach were made from a monocrystalline silicon substrate. Very few works reported the processing of such nanostructure using silicon powder as a feedstock starting material[19, 20]. Second, owing to the advantages offered by wirelike versus porous nanostructures, we preferred using a two-step MACE method instead of the widespread used stain etching in HF/nitric acid (HNO 3) solution[21, 22] by transferring MACE processing from Si wafers to Si powder. The starting samples are small amounts of metallurgical-grade polycrystalline silicon powder having 99.9 % purity. We use silver as a metal catalyst, but other biocompatible metals and trace elements such as Fe and Mg could be experimented[20, 23]. Many authors report synchronized anisotropic growth of SiNWs and branches of treelike silver dendrites during MACE[24 – 32]. However, some other authors report a simultaneous anisotropic etching of Si and isotropic growth of a fractal structure of silver clusters[24, 25]. In this paper, we propose an explanation to the formation mechanism of rod-shaped overlapping silver microclusters. Besides, we highlight the role of the reagents in providing enough holes to facilitate the oxidation and the dissolution of the silicon atoms at the silver/silicon interface. Morphological and structural characterizations of the etched silicon powder have been conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra (RS), and a laser diffraction instrument (LDI). On the basis of these characterizations, we present a correlative study clearing up the SiNW film structure and morphology in connection to the etching duration.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of <b>monocrystalline</b> silicon's well-defined <b>structure</b> {{and the ability}} to prepare hydrogen-terminated surfaces (Si-H) easily and reproducibly has made this material a very attractive substrate for immobilizing functional molecules. The functionalization of Si-H using the covalent attachment of organic monolayers has received intense attention due to the numerous potential applications of controlled and robust organic/Si interfaces. Researchers have investigated these materials in diverse fields such as molecular electronics, chemistry, and bioanalytical chemistry. Applications include the preparation of surface insulators, the incorporation of chemical or biochemical functionality at interfaces for use in photovoltaic conversion, and the development of new chemical and biological sensing devices. Unlike those of gold, silicon's electronic properties are tunable, and researchers can directly integrate silicon-based devices within electronic circuitry. Moreover, the technological processes used for the micro- and nanopatterning of silicon are numerous and mature enough for producing highly miniaturized functional electronic components. In this Account, we describe a powerful approach that integrates redox-active molecules, such as ferrocene, onto silicon toward electrically addressable systems devoted to information storage or transfer. Ferrocene exhibits attractive electrochemical characteristics: fast electron-transfer rate, low oxidation potential, and two stable redox states (neutral ferrocene and oxidized ferrocenium). Accordingly, ferrocene-modified silicon surfaces could be used as charge storage components with the bound ferrocene center as the memory element. Upon application of a positive potential to silicon, ferrocene is oxidized to its corresponding ferrocenium form. This redox change is equivalent to the change of a bit of information from the " 0 " to " 1 " state. To erase the stored charge and return the device to its initial state, a low potential must be applied to reduce the whole generated ferrocenium. In this type of application, the electron is transferred from the ferrocene headgroups to the underlying conducting silicon surface by a tunneling process across the monolayer. To produce a stable and reproducible electrical response, this process must be efficient, fast, and reversible. The stability, charge density, and capacitance performances of high-quality ferrocene-terminated monolayers could compete with those of the existing semiconductor-based memory devices, such as dynamic random access memories, DRAMs. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that a series of immobilized ferrocene centers can efficiently communicate via a lateral electron hopping process. Using these modified interfaces, we demonstrate that the thin redox-active monolayer can behave as a purely conducting material, highlighting an unprecedented very fast electron communication between immobilized redox groups. Perhaps more importantly, the surface coverage of ferrocene allows us to precisely control the rate of this process. Such characteristics are relevant not only for electrocatalytic reactions but also for widening the potential applications of these assemblies to novel molecular electronic devices (e. g. chemiresistors, chemically sensitive field-effect transistors (CHEMFETs)) and redox chemistry on insulating surfaces...|$|R
