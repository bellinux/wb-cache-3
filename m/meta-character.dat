40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{teaching in}} mathematics teacher education {{and is based}} on the implementation of a learning study at teacher training. The overall purpose was to investigate in what way teacher training could facilitate and improve student teachers’ Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT). In the learning study design, MKT was conceptualized as an object of learning with a <b>meta-character,</b> which meant that it was applicable to and transferable between different content areas of mathematics. This made it possible to vary the mathematical content between lessons but to keep the object of learning constant. Four critical features of the object of learning were found, giving insight in some of the problems related to teacher education. Student teachers {{had to be able to}} formulate proper aims for a lesson and to give detailed descriptions of elements of MKT for coherence in their MKT to occur. A focus on student teachers’ role as mathematics teachers had to be established and finally, sufficient mathematical knowledge was found to be a prerequisite for their MKT to develop. The study shows that enactment of these critical features improved the teaching by the teacher educators, which in its turn improved the student teachers’ learning with regard to MKT. The study also indicates that the prescribed design is worth considering for future collaborative efforts of improving teaching where other objects of learning with a similar <b>meta-character</b> are involved. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} the ironic and critical function that the “meta” reflection plays in dramatic and narrative works. In particular, a comparison is {{made between the}} metatheatrical strategies used in Golden Age comedies and the metaliterary discourse proposed by Cervantes in Don Quixote. These self-reflexive elements form part of a ludic structure of detachment and complicity that creates a dynamic and interactive relationship among author, characters and receiver. The main vehicle of this communication is the <b>meta-character,</b> which is projected outside the conventional confines of the work to dialogue with the spectator or the reader and to question the author’s control...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{securities}} trading industry recent technological innovations enable Institutional Investors to self-directed trading and thus {{lead to a}} reassessment of their intermediation relationships. This may yield to an in-sourcing of trading activities by buy-side organization. Scientific literature outlines {{advantages and disadvantages of}} some of them but no empirical investigations are reported concerning drivers for the adoption or refusal of such innovations. Against the background of the increasing market share of technologies, such as Algorithmic Trading, this conceptual paper introduces a model that aims at closing this gap, by identifying the drivers and inhibitors for the adoption of new technology-based execution opportunities. To account for the organizational context of the survey and the <b>meta-character</b> of the innovation, the model incorporates the following modifications of TAM: First, a generalization towards TRA and TPB in order to account for competitive pressure and inhibitors. Second, the integration of TTF, as it is said to exhibit better results for work-related tasks and thus enables the model to account for the fit between the technology and the given task requirements. Finally, a perceived risk construct is added, as in an organizational context the adoption of innovations is associated with risks...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Web {{applications}} {{have been}} the main intrusion target, and input errors from the web users lead to serious security vulnerabilities. Many web applications contain such errors, making them vulnerable to remotely exploitable input validation attacks such as SQL Injection, Command Injection, <b>Meta-Characters,</b> Formatting String, Path Traversal and Cross Site scripting. In this paper, we present ontology to represent patterns of input validation attacks on web applications. More specifically, our ontology is based on individual subclasses, properties and inverse functional properties, domain and range of input validation attack patterns. The ontology is implemented and interpreted with the web application development language OWL (Ontology Web Language) ...|$|R
40|$|Law in the {{contemporary}} United States has achieved unchallenged ascendancy as the principal arena and discourse for decisionmaking in social and political affairs. Law 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to dominate in such decisionmaking is largely dependent on popular confidence in the legitimacy and efficacy of the rules it produces. Legitimacy is in turn grounded upon the repeated invocation over time of foundational values associated with the juridical form: law 2 ̆ 7 s objectivity in application (no one is above the law), universality in implementation (one law for all), and neutrality in outcome (the law does not take sides). Together, these values compose what I shall call law 2 ̆ 7 s meta-character-the normative idealization of the workings of law in society that emanates from 2 ̆ 2 {{the world of the}} law. 2 ̆ 2 As resort to law proliferates, however, actual 2 ̆ 2 legalities 2 ̆ 2 -the legal conditions of social life-are produced not through the elaboration of holistic jurisdictional narratives, but from competitive struggles, adversarial or bureaucratic, to achieve specific, instrumental outcomes. Individuals, agencies, interest groups and social movements (including legal professionals themselves) make particular, self-serving investments in law. The availability of law for widespread use furnishes a practical quotidian basis for law 2 ̆ 7 s social efficacy, but use itself is indifferent to, and may even contradict, law 2 ̆ 7 s <b>meta-character.</b> How is law 2 ̆ 7 s legitimacy - and thus its overall social authority maintained when actual legality is produced in self-serving competition? This Article holds that maintaining law 2 ̆ 7 s social authority is the principal concern of the complex of institutions, actors and ideologies that comprise the world of the law. In particular, it ascribes to the juridical professions (of bench, bar and academy) a major interest in sustaining law 2 ̆ 7 s claim to legitimacy in rulemaking {{in the face of the}} particularism and fragmentation that the professions 2 ̆ 7 pursuit of their own self-interest simultaneously encourages. That is, even as their members use law instrumentally in the service of particular clients, outcomes, or ideas, the juridical professions perform a crucial managerial role in the state formation composed by law 2 ̆ 7 s ascendancy by maintaining a representation of law that validates its proclamations of objectivity, neutrality, universality-and therefore autonomy...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{science and}} its {{political}} appearance are studied through an empirical exploration of their representations in narrative expressions. The field of investigation is allocated to formal and informal discourse on university, education and research in Sweden and China. The analysed expressions were taken from 202 written reports, as students and personnel in both countries answered an open ended-question, and four formal documents: the Chinese and Swedish laws on higher education and documents on research, science, and technology. The narratives were processed through a Meaning-Constitution-Analysis (MCA), a tool used to perform a deep study of a text based on a phenomenological approach that aims at making the implied assumptions and worldviews explicit. The analysis revealed a common representation of the university as an intermediary {{between the government and}} the student in the Swedish narratives and as a <b>meta-character</b> differentiated from the government in the Chinese narratives. Further, the meaning of science appeared as an adjective that characterizes a certain sphere of life in the informal narratives and as a dynamic behind a desired development in the formal narratives. The meaning of politics emerged in the Swedish narratives as the formation of an environment, mainly for activities in an institutional balance between input and outcomes. In the Chinese narratives, politics appeared as a competition for status, in which both academia and the government claim the recognition awarded for successful development. These representations of politics can guide the interpretation of the otherwise quite general understanding of education as a structure to be filled with activities in the Swedish narratives and an object for a discussion based on values in the Chinese narratives as well as the representation of research as an asset in the Swedish narratives and a source of legitimacy in the Chinese narratives. The narrative contexts are similarly shaped by representations of an acting government, but they are different as the government takes the initiative in Swedish narratives in a task-oriented discourse, while it gets involved in ongoing academic life in the Chinese narratives in a process-oriented discourse. The narrative contexts in the formal narratives are mainly centred on the outcomes, regarding a development that is the result of a dynamic, while the informal narratives are centred on the drivers. The revealed dimensions were analysed in relation to theories on historical phases as stories, inspired by Hayhoe (1996), and science cultures, inspired by Elzinga and Jamison (1995). The approaches in the Chinese narratives indicate a tension between academic/civic and bureaucratic/political science cultures which are advantageously framed by the differences in imperial and nationalist stories in contrast to a socialist story. The analysed Swedish narratives indicate a homogeneous representation of a dominant bureaucratic/economic science culture, in which the universities and their staffs represent the government and are centred on the rights of the students and an expected outcome. The central concerns appear in the light of attributed tasks and invested means, and is advantageously framed by a story of an increasing focus on the uses of the university on the potential expense of academic concerns...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} effort by {{molecular}} systematists, the trees {{of life of}} eukaryotic organisms still remain partly unresolved or in conflict with each other. An ever increasing number of fully-sequenced genomes of various eukaryotes allows to consider gene and species phylogenies at genome-scale. However, such phylogenomics-based approaches also revealed that more taxa {{and more and more}} gene sequences are not the ultimate solution to fully resolve these conflicts, {{and that there is a}} need for sequence-independent phylogenetic meta-characters that are derived from genome sequences. Spliceosomal introns are characteristic features of eukaryotic nuclear genomes. The relatively rare changes of spliceosomal intron positions have already been used as genome-level markers, both for the estimation of intron evolution and phylogenies, however with variable success. In this thesis, a specific subset of these changes is introduced and established as a novel phylogenetic marker, termed near intron pair (NIP). These characters are inferred from homologous genes that contain mutually-exclusive intron presences at pairs of coding sequence (CDS) positions in close proximity. The idea that NIPs are powerful characters is based on the assumption that both very small exons and multiple intron gains at the same position are rare. To obtain sufficient numbers of NIP character data from genomic and alignment data sets in a consistent and flexible way, the implementation of a computational pipeline was a main goal of this work. Starting from orthologous (or more general: homologous) gene datasets comprising genomic sequences and corresponding CDS transcript annotations, the multiple alignment generation is an integral part of this pipeline. The alignment can be calculated at the amino acid level utilizing external tools (e. g. transAlign) and results in a codon alignment via back-translation. Guided by the multiple alignment, the positionally homologous intron positions should become apparent when mapped individually for each transcript. The pipeline proceeds at this stage to output portions of the intron-annotated alignment that contain at least one candidate of a NIP character. In a subsequent pipeline script, these collected so-called NIP region files are finally converted to binary state characters representing valid NIPs in dependence of quality filter constraints concerning, e. g., the amino acid alignment conservation around intron loci and splice sites, to name a few. The computational pipeline tools provide the researcher to elaborate on NIP character matrices that can be used for tree inference, e. g., using the maximum parsimony approach. In a first NIP-based application, the phylogenetic position of major orders of holometabolic insects (more specifically: the Coleoptera-Hymenoptera-Mecopterida trifurcation) was evaluated in a cladistic sense. As already suggested during a study on the eIF 2 gamma gene based on two NIP cases (Krauss et al. 2005), the genome-scale evaluation supported Hymenoptera as sister group to an assemblage of Coleoptera and Mecopterida, in agreement with other studies, but contradicting the previously established view. As part of the genome paper describing a new species of twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), the NIP method was employed to help to resolve the phylogenetic position of them within (holometabolic) insects. Together with analyses of sequence patterns and a further <b>meta-character,</b> it revealed twisted-wing parasites as being the closest relatives of the mega-diverse beetles. NIP-based reconstructions of the metazoan tree covering a broad selection of representative animal species also identified some weaknesses of the NIP approach that may suffer e. g. from alignment/ortholog prediction artifacts (depending on the depth of range of taxa) and systematic biases (long branch attraction artifacts, due to unequal evolutionary rates of intron gain/loss and the use of the maximum parsimony method). In a further study, the identification of NIPs within the recently diverged genus Drosophila could be utilized to characterize recent intron gain events that apparently involved several cases of intron sliding and tandem exon duplication, albeit the mechanisms of gain for the majority of cases could not be elucidated. Finally, the NIP marker could be established as a novel phylogenetic marker, in particular dedicated to complementarily explore the wealth of genome data for phylogenetic purposes and to address open questions of intron evolution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{define a}} novel {{variation}} on the constrained sequence alignment problem in which the constraint is given {{in the form of}} a regular expression. Given two sequences, an alphabet Γ describing pairwise sequence alignment operations, and a regular expression R over Γ, the problem is to compute the highest scoring sequence alignment A of the given sequences, such that A ∈Γ^* L(R) Γ^*. Two algorithms are given for solving this problem. The first basic algorithm is general and solves the problem in O(nmr ^ 2 r) time and O({n,m}r) space, where m and n are the lengths of the two sequences and r is the size of the NFA for R. The second algorithm is restricted to patterns P that do not contain the Kleene-closure star, and exploits this constraint to reduce the NFA size factor r in the time complexity to a smaller factor |P|. |P| is compacted by supporting alignment patterns extended by <b>meta-characters</b> including general insertion, deletion and match operations, as well as some cases of substitutions. For a regular expression P=P_ 1 ∪ [...] . ∪ P_k, these time bounds range from O(knm) to O(knm({|P_i|})), depending on the <b>meta-characters</b> used in P. An additional result obtained along the way is an extension of the algorithm of Fischer and Paterson for String Matching with Wildcards. Our extension allows the input strings to include "negation symbols" (that match all letters but a specific one) while retaining the original time complexity. We implemented both algorithms and applied them to data-mine new miRNA seeding patterns in C. elegans Clip-seq experimental data...|$|R

Such languages are usually complex, making learning of the language difficult and error-prone. For this reason, a simple description of any command language is crucial to its success.

One method uses special <b>meta-characters</b> to represent grammatical relations, whereas a graphic method uses boxes and arrows much like a flowchart. In Experiment], the graphic method was learned faster and with fewer errors.

40|$|Most digital {{forensic}} analysis tools allow the specification of search strings as regular expressions {{and the search}} for all terms included in keyword lists (for example, slang terms that criminals use to refer to certain drugs). Unfortunately, due to the combination of characters and <b>meta-characters</b> used in regular expressions, many agents have problems writing them. Also, it can take them years to build a solid, complete keyword list, adding a few new terms with each case that they investigate. ^ I created a repository so that law enforcement agents can create, access, download and comment on validated search string expressions and keyword lists. I collaborated with the team from the URI Digital Forensics Center who developed a regular expression generator, so my repository is flawlessly integrated with this tool and agents can easily upload new search strings. This project has followed sound software engineering practices and the repository has been deployed in the Electronic Crime Technology Center of Excellence (ECTCoE) site of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). ...|$|R
