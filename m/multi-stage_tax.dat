25|$|Value-added tax (VAT) in Vietnam is {{a broadly}} based {{consumption}} tax assessed {{on the value}} added to goods and services arising {{through the process of}} production, circulation, and consumption. It's an indirect tax in Vietnam on domestic consumption applied nationwide rather than at different levels such as state, provincial or local taxes. It is a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>tax</b> which is collected at every stage of the production and distribution chain and passed on to the final customer. It is applicable to the majority of goods and services bought and sold for use in the country. Goods that are sold for export and services that are sold to customers abroad are normally not subject to VAT.|$|E

The understanding and awareness of people and taxable person about GST can be seen from the success of the advertisements and programs held by the Royal Malaysian Custom Departments (RMCD) and other government agencies throughout 2014 onwards. GST is known as a <b>multi-stages</b> <b>tax</b> affected to each stage of products or services circulation. In other words, there will be 6 % tax imposed on all goods and services with some exception on certain items. Therefore, RMCD shall look after GST governance to ensure that taxable entities are continuously complying with all the regulations enforced under GST Act 2014, GST Rules 2014 and GST Order 2014. The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection are very important for government to support the socioeconomic development of the country. GST governance as a process in guiding an entity with regards to their tax responsibilities will lead the entity to be more concerned about their contributions to the nation building. This study discusses the GST governance from overseas practices such as governance and risk management, processing and reporting, resources and capabilities and assurance that can be adapted into Malaysian context for best practice actions. It will contribute to the GST literature from the Malaysian perspective which might differ from other countries...|$|R
