40|$|Seven butyrophenones {{in human}} whole blood were {{analyzed}} by LC/MS/MS using a new polymer column (MSpak GF- 310), which enabled direct injection of crude biological samples without complicated pretreatments. The quantitation was made by mass chromatography for each product ion, The recoveries were more than 50 % for haloperidol, bromperidol, <b>moperone</b> and spiroperidol at 80 ng/ml in whole blood, but less than 10 % for pimozide. The regression equations showed good linearity for haloperidol, bromperidol, <b>moperone</b> and spiroperidol {{in the range of}} 10 - 80 ng/ml, for timiperone in the range of 20 - 80 ng/ml and for pimozide in the range of 50 - 200 ng/ml using the chlorinated analog of haloperidol as internal standard, Their detection limits were about 5 ng/ml for haloperidol, bromperidol, <b>moperone</b> and spiroperidol, about 10 ng/ml for timiperone and about 25 ng/ml for pimozide. Thus, the present method seems useful for sensitive and specific detection and determination of their high therapeutic and toxic levels present in biological specimens including whole blood. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Haloperidol, <b>moperone,</b> {{pipamperone}} and bromperidol {{were found}} measurable with high sensitivity by gas chromatography (GC) with surface ionization detection (SID). The calibration curves using <b>moperone</b> as internal standard were linear {{in the range}} of 0. 4 - 4 pmol on column for haloperidol, pipamperone, and bromperidol. The detection limit of the drugs was about 0. 1 pmol on column. For their actual determination with forensic samples, a detailed procedure for their extraction from human whole blood and urine was established with Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges. The recovery of the 4 drugs, which had been added to whole blood and urine, was more than 90 %. Haloperidol in whole blood and urine of a schizophrenic patient, who had been administered with this drug (3 mg/day p. o.), could be quantitated by the present GC-SID, and the levels were 7. 18 and 43. 2 pmol/ml, respectively. rights:日本法医学会rights:本文データは日本法医学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{specificity}} of several classes of {{drugs such as}} antipsychotics and antiischemic agents was assessed for σ receptors labeled with [(3) H] haloperidol. Specific binding of [(3) H] haloperidol {{in the presence of}} 25 nM spiperone was saturable and high affinity) Kd= 1. 96 ± 1. 31 nM, Bmax= 2. 37 ± 0. 27 pmol/mg of protein;n= 8). Among the 29 antipsychotics tested in inhibition studies, bromperidol and haloperidol were the most potent inhibitors (Ki= 0. 9 nM, 1. 0 nM, respectively). The conventional antipsychotics <b>moperone,</b> timiperone etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and remoxipride potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar. On the other hand, among the other 27 drugs tested, the antispasmodics eperisone and tolperisone, the antiischemic agents ifenprodil, the Ca(2 +) antagonist flunarizine and cinnarizine, and the antitussives carbetapentane, cloperastine and dextromethorphan, were especially potent inhibitors. These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E
