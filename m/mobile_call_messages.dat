50|$|As {{responsible}} rapporteur in {{the industry}} committee {{and one of the}} most active supporters of the citizens initiative Europeans for Fair Roaming it was Rübig, as the key actor, who enforced the roaming rules at European level. Against massive opposition of the telecom industry, following his initiative, the costs for cross-border <b>mobile</b> <b>calls,</b> text <b>messaging</b> and <b>mobile</b> data transfers were gradually reduced. From 1 July 2013 on, mobile communication providers are only allowed to charge consumers following maximum prices: 24 cents (active calls), 7 cents (passive calls), 8 cents (text messages) and 45 cents (1 MB data packet). These ceilings will be again reduced before the summer 2014. Regardless of a further reduction of these ceilings in summer 2014, Rübig pushes now for a general abolition of roaming charges before the elections to the European Parliament in May 2014. In the New York Times he called upon the responsible Commissioner Neelie Kroes for swift and concrete implementation plans.|$|R
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen {{striking}} increases in travel and in communications at-a-distance through <b>mobile</b> phone <b>calls,</b> text <b>messaging</b> and emailing. People in prosperous societies are both travelling and communicating more to connect with absent others. People can travel, relocate and migrate and yet still be connected {{with friends and family}} members 'back home'. So, increasingly, people who are near emotionally may be geographically very far away; yet they are only a journey, email or a phone call away. In this article we attempt to examine how such strong ties are spatially distributed and sustained through specific geographies of travel, meetings and communications. How often do strong ties meet, talk at-at-distance and write, and to what degree does distance determine regularity? To what extent are communications enhancing and/or substituting for physical travel? We examine in particular to what degree far-flung ties and emotional networking at-a-distance are characteristic of many people other than the transnational 'elites' and 'underprivileged' migrants. We consider the notion of 'network capital'...|$|R
50|$|The Dark {{social media}} {{is the social}} media tools used to {{collaborate}} between individuals where contents {{are supposed to be}} only available to the participants. However, unlike <b>mobile</b> phone <b>calls</b> or <b>messaging</b> where information is sent from one user, transmitted through a medium and stored on each user devices, with the medium having no storage permission of the actual content of the data, more and more communication methods include a centralized server where all the contents are received, stored, and then transmitted. Some examples of these new mechanisms include Google Doc, Facebook Messages or Snapchat. All of the information passes through these channels has largely been unaccounted for by users themselves and the data analytics. However, in addition to their respective users private companies (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat) that provided these services do have complete control over such data. The number of images, links, referrals and information pass through digital is supposed to be completely unaccounted for in the marketing scheme of things.|$|R
40|$|The growing {{awareness}} that human communications and social interactions are assuming a stratified structure, {{due to the}} availability of multiple techno-communication channels, including online social networks, <b>mobile</b> phone <b>calls,</b> short <b>messages</b> (SMS) and e-mails, has recently led {{to the study of}} multidimensional networks, as a step further the classical Social Network Analysis. A few papers have been dedicated to develop the theoretical framework to deal with such multiplex networks and to analyze some example of multidimensional social networks. In this context we perform the first study of the multiplex mobile social network, gathered from the records of both <b>call</b> and text <b>message</b> activities of millions of users of a large mobile phone operator over a period of 12 weeks. While social networks constructed from mobile phone datasets have drawn great attention in recent years, so far studies have dealt with text <b>message</b> and <b>call</b> data, separately, providing a very partial view of people sociality expressed on phone. Here we analyze how the call and the text message dimensions overlap showing how many information about links and nodes could be lost only accounting for a single layer and how users adopt different media channels to interact with their neighborhood.

40|$|Research {{on social}} network {{analysis}} (SNA) has been actively pursued. Most SNAs focus on either social relationship networks (e. g., friendship and trust networks) or social interaction networks (e. g., email and phone call networks). It is expected that the social relationship network and social interaction network of a group would be closely related to each other. For instance, people in the same community in a social relationship network are expected {{to communicate with each}} other more frequently than with people in different communities. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is not yet any empirical evidence to support the existence of such interaction locality in large-scale online social networks. This paper aims to bridge the evidence gap between intuition about interaction locality and confirmation that it occurs. We investigate the strength of interaction locality in large-scale social networks by analyzing several types of data: logs of <b>mobile</b> phone <b>calls,</b> email <b>messages,</b> and message exchanges in a social networking service. Our results show that strong interaction locality is observed equally in the three datasets and suggest that the strength of the interaction locality is fractal, by which we mean that the strength is invariant with regard to the scale of the community...|$|R
40|$|Delay {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) are a {{class of}} emerging networks that exhibit significantly different characteristics from today's Internet, such as intermittent connectivity, large delay, and high loss rates. DTNs have important applications in disaster relief, military, rural Internet access, environmental sensing and surveillance, interplanetary communication, underwater sensing, and vehicular communication. While not the common case for networking, DTNs represent {{some of the most}} critical cases, where the ability to communicate can make a huge difference for human lives. Supporting effective communication in DTNs, however, is challenging. First, with intermittent connectivity, DTNs are often extremely limited in capacity. Second, given resource limitations and uncertainty in DTNs, it is critical to deliver data efficiently and robustly. The situation is especially acute for multicast which sends data to multiple destinations. This thesis seeks to address these two issues. To enhance network capacity in DTNs, we propose a message ferrying scheme that exploits the use of special <b>mobile</b> nodes (<b>called</b> <b>message</b> ferries) and controlled device mobility to deliver data. Message ferries are utilized to transport data via mobility between sources and destinations. We develop a foundation for the control of the mobility of message ferries, and nodes if possible, to cooperatively deliver data under a variety of conditions. We also study another approach which deploys new nodes called throwboxes to enhance capacity. Throwboxes are small and inexpensive wireless devices. By relaying data between mobile nodes, throwboxes are able to create data transfer opportunities that otherwise would not exist. We systematically investigate the issues of deployment and routing, and develop algorithms for various deployment and routing approaches. Based on extensive evaluation, we obtain several findings to guide the design and operation of throwbox-augmented DTNs. To address the issue of efficient and robust data delivery, we focus on DTN multicasting. Given the unique characteristics of DTNs, traditional solutions such as IP multicast can not be simply ported to DTNs. We identify the limitations of IP multicast semantics in DTNs and define new semantic models for DTN multicast. Based on these semantic models, we develop and evaluate several multicast routing algorithms with different routing strategies. Ph. D.

40|$|In today’s technology-assisted society, social {{interactions}} may be expressed {{through a variety}} of techno-communication channels, including online social networks, email and <b>mobile</b> phones (<b>calls,</b> text <b>messages).</b> Consequently, a clear grasp of human behavior through the diverse communication media is considered a key factor in understanding the formation of the today’s information society. So far, all previous research on user communication behavior has focused on a sole communication activity. In this paper we move forward another step on this research path by performing a multidimensional study of human sociality as an expression of the use of mobile phones. The paper focuses on user temporal communication behavior in the interplay between the two complementary communication media, text <b>messages</b> and phone <b>calls,</b> that represent the bi-dimensional scenario of analysis. Our study provides a theoretical framework for analyzing multidimensional bursts as the most general burst category, that includes one-dimensional bursts as the simplest case, and offers empirical evidence of their nature by following the combined phone call/text message communication patterns of approximately one million people over three-month period. This quantitative approach enables the design of a generative model rooted in the three most significant features of the multidimensional burst- the number of dimensions, prevalence and interleaving degree- able to reproduce the main media usage attitude. The other findings of the paper include a novel multidimensional burst detection algorithm and an insight analysis of the human media selection process...|$|R

30|$|The channel {{assignment}} {{problem is a}} complex problem which requires that under certain constraints a minimum number of channels have to be assigned to <b>mobile</b> <b>calls</b> in the wireless mobile system. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, {{which is based on}} double band frequency and channel borrowing strategy. The proposed scheme takes into account factors such as limited bandwidth of wireless networks and the capacity of underlying servers involved in processing <b>mobile</b> <b>calls.</b> It aims to ensure end-to-end performance by considering the characteristics of mobile devices. This is achieved by determining the position of users (or mobile stations) in wireless mobile systems. The proposed scheme is simulated in order to investigate its efficiency within a specific area of a large city in Saudi Arabia. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the performance of <b>mobile</b> <b>calls</b> as well as reduces the blocking when the number of <b>mobile</b> <b>call</b> increases.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, we {{witnessed}} the {{growing awareness of}} the fact that human communications and social interactions are built on a stratified structure [1]. Today, a variety of techno-communication channels—including online social networks, <b>mobile</b> phone <b>calls,</b> short <b>message</b> services (SMSs), and e-mails—provides an intricate bundle of interactions that is overlaid on real life relationships enabled by individuals’ spatial proximity. Among all, communication networks constructed on top of mobile phone interactions have attracted increasing research activities in recent years, becoming a relevant topic in the computational social science [2]. Results have led to important advances in understanding the communication behaviors of mobile users [3, 4] at different scales. For instance, the structural properties of the mobile phone graphs have been investigated by Nanavati et al. [5] and by Onnela et al. [3], whose studies represent the first attempt to analyze large social networks as they emerge from mobile communications. On the other side, a great effort has been devoted to study the local properties of mobile phone graphs. Many researchers proposed measures to characterize the properties of the links: the burstiness level [6, 7] and the link persistence [4] are often used to describe link dynamics, whereas the link overlap [3] captures the role of the link with respect to (w.r.t.) dense/sparse structures. Nonetheless, most of these studies limit their analysis to one or two ways of communication, while an all-around vision is still missing. Mainly, studies consider the set of voice call data, while, for instance, text messages (either instant messages or SMSs) have been considered rarely and separately from phone calls [5, 8], when analyzing human communications and spatial proximity.|$|R
