5|$|There {{was also}} air {{activity}} over German-held territory. RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne, Calais, Ostend, Dunkirk, and Antwerp. The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> Hamm and Krefeld. One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed to return. It {{was lost to}} ground fire over the Netherlands. A total of 157 sorties were flown overall. By the September 1940, some 10–13% of invasion barges had been sunk.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, Edwards became {{commanding}} officer of No. 105 Squadron replacing the previous incumbent, {{who had been killed}} in an anti-shipping raid on Stavanger. At that time, the Squadron was engaged in a series of daylight operations against Germany and the occupied countries, with its principal targets being enemy shipping, power installations, shipbuilding yards, locomotives, steelworks and <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards.</b> On 15 June, by now an acting wing commander, Edwards led six Blenheims on a search for enemy shipping and soon sighted a convoy of eight merchantmen anchored near The Hague. He launched an attack at low level, his bombs striking a 4,000 ton ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.|$|E
5|$|The Allies also {{conducted}} a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges {{over the river}} Seine from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during {{an attack on the}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> at Lille on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April {{as part of an effort}} to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E

5|$|The {{spoil heap}} of Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, which includes 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.|$|E
50|$|Leipzig-Engelsdorf <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (Bahnhof Leipzig-Engelsdorf) is {{the central}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in the Leipzig rail node in the German state of Saxony.

The halts of Leipzig Werkstättenstraße (on the Leipzig-Geithain railway) and Leipzig-Engelsdorf Hp (Haltepunkte, on the Leipzig-Dresden railway) are located in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> area.

50|$|On 1 December 1941, a {{new line}} was opened between Ranam and Ch'ŏngjin to allow trains to bypass the Ch'ŏngjin <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard.</b> The {{existing}} line, running via Kangdŏk and the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> was detached from the Hamgyeong Line and designated the Kangdŏk Line; at the same time, a 2.4 km connection from Ch'ŏngjin Sŏhang Station (Ch'ŏngjin West Port, today called Songp'yŏng) to Kangdŏk was built, to allow southbound trains to access the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> without having to reverse at Ranam.|$|R

25|$|The newly amalgamated Southern Railway {{needed a}} group of {{powerful}} shunting tank locomotives to work in its <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> around London and on freight transfers between them. Robert Urie's G16 class 4-8-0 performed this task well, and further examples were on order in 1922, but Richard Maunsell considered the firebox to be too large and the superheater an unnecessary expense on such locomotives. He therefore cancelled the order in favour of a new design.|$|E
