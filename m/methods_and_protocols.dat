40|$|AbstractExcitation mapping is {{a method}} of {{visualizing}} the signaling history of neurons with permeant organic cations. It is compatible with high-resolution imaging, allowing concurrent visualization of all neuronal classes and their glutamate-gated excitation histories. Excitation mapping documents the stability and precision of neuronal signaling within a given neuronal class, arguing that single unit electrophysiological sampling accurately reflects neuronal diversity. We here review the theory of excitation mapping, provide <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocol</b> links; outline imaging concepts; provide parametric data on the temporal range and physiological sensitivity of excitation mapping; and show that immunocytochemical methods for macromolecules are compatible with excitation mapping...|$|R

40|$|A novel <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocol</b> {{establishing}} common secrecy {{based on}} physical parameters between two users is proposed. The four physical parameters of users are their clock frequencies, their relative clock phases {{and the distance}} between them. The protocol proposed between two users is backed by theoretical model for the measurements. Further, estimators are proposed to estimate secret physical parameters. Physically exchanged parameters are shown to be secure {{by virtue of their}} non-observability to adversaries. Under a simplified analysis based on a testbed settings, it is shown that 38 bits of common secrecy can be derived for one run of the proposed protocol among users. The method proposed is also robust against various kinds of active timing attacks and active impersonating adversaries...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{cerebral}} autoregulation, {{that is the}} {{transient response}} of cerebral blood flow to changes in arterial blood pressure, is currently assessed {{using a variety of}} different time series <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> data collection <b>protocols.</b> In the continuing absence of a gold standard for the study of cerebral autoregulation it is unclear to what extent does the assessment depend on the choice of a computational <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocol.</b> We use continuous measurements of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery from the cohorts of 18 normotensive subjects performing sit-to-stand manoeuvre. We estimate cerebral autoregulation using a wide variety of black-box approaches (ARI, Mx, Sx, Dx, FIR and ARX) and compare them in the context of reproducibility and variability. For all autoregulation indices, considered here, the ICC was greater during the standing protocol, however, it was significantly greater (Fisher's Z-test) for Mx (p < 0. 03), Sx (p< 0. 003) $ and Dx (p< 0. 03). In the specific case of the sit-to-stand manoeuvre, measurements taken immediately after standing up greatly improve the reproducibility of the autoregulation coefficients. This is generally coupled with an increase of the within-group spread of the estimates. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn intact {{vascular}} endothelium {{is critical to}} the maintenance of normal arterial tone and coagulation status. Endothelial injury leading to dysfunction is thought to be a precursor to most if not all vascular disease, and has been implicated as a critical event in atherosclerosis. At present there are several methods available for detection of in vivo endothelial function, and the aim {{of this study was to}} critically review these methods. Five distinct <b>methods</b> were identified <b>and</b> studied in detail. These <b>methods</b> are diverse <b>and</b> each assesses a different vascular bed. Importantly there is no uniformity among investigators over choice of <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocol,</b> making it difficult to compare in vivo enothelial dysfunction between groups. These issues need to be addressed in large scale comparative analyses so that investigators can agree a common approach to endothelial function assessment...|$|R
