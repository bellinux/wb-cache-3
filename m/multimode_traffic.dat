In this the Mixed Signal Processor is used for the controlling of the whole system. This controller unit is placed in both the vehicle as well as road side. An algorithm based on this is Vehicular Ad-hoc Network, from this algorithm the vehicle and road side networks could communicate with each other wirelessly. The developed sensor system is compact, wireless, and inexpensive. Vehicle classification is useful in a number of applications, including road maintenance and management, roadway design, emissions evaluation, <b>multimode</b> <b>traffic</b> model development, traffic control, traffic signal design, and tol...|$|E
