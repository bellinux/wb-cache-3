5|$|On the estate, Wason built a {{model village}} called Barrhill, with avenues forming a grid layout and a central market square. Barrhill had 28 sections, {{including}} a post office, bakery, school, church, other facilities, and fifteen cottages were built.

The post office opened in 1876 {{and in the}} same year, construction of the church began, and these buildings <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> Barrhill.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|The early {{plays of}} Henry Fielding <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> Fielding's {{literary}} career. His early plays span {{the time period}} from his first production in 1728 {{to the beginning of}} the Actor's Rebellion of 1733, a strife within the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his ideas on these matters throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of {{children and their families}} is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E

5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to {{an aristocratic}} family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon. In 1754, having left school, Crèvecœur visited relatives in England where he became engaged; this visit would <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a lifelong admiration for the culture and politics of the country. Shortly after this, possibly due {{to the death of}} his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|The 1882 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1882 college football season. The team {{was the second}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy, and the first since 1879. The team was coached by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and was entirely student-operated. It was captained by squad member Alex Jackson. The team played just a single game, an 8 to 0 (8–0) shutout of Johns Hopkins, which was the school's first ever win. The squad was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. The season would <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> eight season rivalry between the Midshipmen and Johns Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E
5|$|Various astronomical {{alignments}} and numerological formulae were {{proposed as}} pertaining to this date. A New Age interpretation {{held that the}} date marked {{the start of a}} period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a new era. Others suggested that the date marked {{the end of the world}} or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth's collision with a planet called Nibiru.|$|E
5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office {{was not on}} the cursus honorum, and therefore did not <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, while under the presidency of a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E

5|$|GDRT {{was most}} likely the first Aksumite king to be {{involved}} in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The last {{decades of}} the 19th century saw concerted {{political}} campaigns for Irish home rule. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852. Home rule {{was supported by the}} British Prime minister, William Gladstone, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the break-up of the empire. A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons. A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
