500|$|The {{title of}} the song came from a street named Blue Jay Way, one of the [...] "bird streets" [...] high in the Hollywood Hills West area {{overlooking}} the Sunset Strip, where Harrison had rented a house for his stay. Jet-lagged after the flight from London, he began writing the composition on a Hammond organ as he and Boyd waited for Taylor and the latter's wife, Joan, to join them. The home's location, on a hillside of narrow, winding roads, together with the foggy conditions that night, created the backdrop for the song's opening lines: [...] "There's a fog upon L.A. / And <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>have</b> lost their way." [...] Harrison had almost completed the song {{by the time the}} Taylors arrived, around two hours later than planned.|$|E
500|$|Taylor later {{expressed}} amusement at {{how some}} commentators interpreted [...] "don't be long" [...] as meaning [...] "don't belong" [...] – {{a message to}} Western youth {{to opt out of}} society – and at how the line [...] "And <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>have</b> lost their way" [...] supposedly conveyed the idea that [...] "a whole generation had lost direction". With regard to whether Harrison was telling contemporary listeners not to [...] "belong", Inglis writes, this [...] "alternative reading" [...] of the song aligned with Timothy Leary's catchphrase for the 1960s American psychedelic experience, [...] "Turn on, tune in, drop out". In Gould's opinion, the continual repetition of the line at the end of [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] transforms the words into [...] "a plea for nonattachment – 'don't belong'". Rather than attaching any countercultural significance to this, however, Gould views it as the Beatles repeating the wordplay first used in the chorus of Lennon's 1963 song [...] "It Won't Be Long".|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{journalist}} Sacha Kester, in a 2003 {{article in the}} Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of Sathya Sai Baba whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book Karma Cola describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta, [...] "It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>have</b> become crazy in India". She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners {{do not believe in}} spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.|$|E
