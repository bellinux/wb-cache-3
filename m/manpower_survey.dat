The objective {{of this research is}} to examine whether independent variables (honored employee status, wage effect, promotion, effect of economy status, and employee performance) has a significant relationship on workers retention and alternative age and education level play a moderate role in the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. The research found that independent variable (wage effect and employee performance) has a significant relationship with the workers retention and independent variables (honored employee status, promotion, and effect of economy cycle) do not have significant relationship with workers retention. Also there are no moderating effect of age and education levels on the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. The research hypothesis tested using SPSS tools of multiple regression and hierarchical regression. From the result, the reason on why honored employee status is not significant because according to <b>Manpower</b> <b>survey</b> (2010) and employers indicated their organization does not have a proactive process in place to capture a person's job knowledge and according to Aberdeen Group (2009) human resources executives and line of business managers surveyed rated 'Capturing and transferring knowledge from those who have it to those who need it' as a top workforce-related challenge. It shows that not all private sector willing to do transfer knowledge or proactively honored their employee status. Usually this is because they only focusing on monetary benefits. According to Singler, (1999). p ay rates as their prime weapon in retaining staff, pay incentives will help align the employees Interest with those of the organization's owner and efforts to improve job satisfaction through employee autonomy, training, and pleasant working conditions will help retain talented employees. Base on Lazear (1986) he stated that promoted workers may develop general human capital, making them more valuable to the firm's competitors, making turnover more likely. Accordingly, it might be said that though a recent promotion provides a timely motivation to deter turnover, on the average, promotion Inversely increases propensity to turnover and reduces the length of time one retains his or her job. Meanwhile, according to <b>Manpower</b> <b>survey</b> (2010), It stated that employers cited 'to start own business or retire' as the most common reason their employees left voluntarily in 2009. A person who is working in private sectors will run their own business although they are working. This Is maybe because they are having less stress, enjoying their live {{and at the same time}} getting a work life balance. Lazear (1999) he found better performers were less likely to turnover. He argued that individual performance is often closely associated with some degree of firm-specific characteristics. Better performance, thus, reflects more beneficial firm-specific skills, which may motivate retention. According to Pelled (1996) when he argued that demographics, such as, age, education level race, and gender are visible and silent.

Furthermore, by comparing the different residual means between industry switchers and stayers based on each industry's wage equation, it is found that the switchers are low-wage workers who tend to be located in the high-wage industries.

Paper {{presented}} 16 October, 1995 At {{the end of}} the 1960 s, after South African capitalism {{had experienced}} a decade of unprecedented economic growth, scholars were deeply divided over the impact of this economic growth on racial inequality. Although the deepest differences were between liberal scholars who argued that economic growth would erode racial inequality and revisionists who argued the converse, there was little agreement even among revisionists on the extent and pattern of changes to the racial division of labour in South Africa. I shall argue that the reasons for the different estimates of the extent and pattern of African advancement are due to the limitations inherent in neo-Marxist theories of class and of the sources of data used by revisionists. To provide a reliable estimate of the extent and pattern of African advancement that overcomes some of these limitations, I have relied on a somewhat eclectic classification scheme that incorporates insights from labour process theory and Weberian class theory. Following the example of Simkins and Hindson, I turned to the <b>Manpower</b> <b>Survey</b> data instead of the Population Census because it provides a more detailed occupational classification and time series. The results of my analysis are restricted to the formal urban workforce. Following earlier analyses of African advancement, this study does not deal with the question of African unemployment. Although an analysis of unemployment would greatly enrich this study, there are no data which provide an occupational breakdown of the unemployed population. A study of the inequalities caused by unemployment therefore has to be conducted through an analysis of trends in wages and income which I have dealt with elsewhere...|$|E

The {{continued}} {{growth of the}} South African tourist industry was assumed and projections up to year 2020 were made to establish the corresponding growth in employment opportunities in the hotel industry. Overseas tourism is sensitive to and dependent on many factors. These were identified and the performance {{over the past two}} decades for bona fide overseas visitors, excluding mere border crossings, were extrapolated, accepting that oscillations about the suggested trend line will become greater in the future. In order to predict the growth of domestic tourism, cognisance had to be taken of the demographic development of the various population groups. The distribution of wealth among the various groups was estimated in the short, medium and long terms. On it depends the choice of accommodation when going on holiday. An evaluation was made of the employment pattern in the South African hotel industry. Published data from the Central Statistical Services and the Bureau of Financial Analysis (BFA) of the University of Pretoria were used. The 1982 <b>Manpower</b> <b>Survey</b> of the BFA proved particularly useful in establishing the present distribution of skilled staff in the industry by hotel grading and by geographical area. Performance ratios were calculated relative to capital invested and to revenue earned. The lowest staff to room ratios were used as criterion for optimal and most efficient usage of staff. The model thus developed with the aid of the Hewlett Packard STATP computer program, was based on actual present performance of a certain category of hotels. Unlike other approaches reported in the literature, a clear distinction was here made between skilled and unskilled labour. This distinction is considered to be of prime importance to any developing country where a shortage of skilled staff generally prevails, in contrast to a vast supply of untrained labour...|$|E

MethodsThe survey instrument was updated from the 2005 survey. It was received by 5265 surgeon members of the STS/AATS during November and December 2009. There was a superb 50 % return rate. The data were entered into a comprehensive database. Perception Solutions, Inc, independently performed the analysis. ResultsThe median age of the active US thoracic surgeons is 52. 9 years. Women comprise 3. 4 % of adult cardiac, 5. 2 % of congenital heart, and 7. 9 % of general thoracic surgeons. The decision {{to pursue a career}} in thoracic surgery was made before or in medical school by 45. 3 % of surgeons. The majority of survey respondents had a mean of 8. 7 years of residency training after medical school graduation. The cumulative average educational debt was $ 56, 000. Overall career satisfaction was 46 % (very or extremely satisfied). Database participation was 84 %. Operative volume over the past 12 months decreased for 30 % of surgeons. Malpractice premiums have steadily increased over the past 5 years from $ 55, 947 to $ 59, 673. The number of additional years the currently active US cardiothoracic surgeon plans to practice is 12. 6 years. Therefore, the projected retirement age of the thoracic surgery workforce will be 65. This is consistent among all surgeons: adult cardiac, 66 years; congenital heart, 65 years; and general thoracic, 67 years. ConclusionsThese data give a clear profile of the specialty at this time. The major challenges remain length of training and educational debt of the thoracic surgeon. Case volume, scope of practice, malpractice costs, and career satisfaction remain major elements to provide a positive environment to recruit new surgeons in to the specialty. The resident pool has contracted while the workforce ages and retirement looms. Significant shortages may develop as the US population ages in the environment of health care reform...|$|R
