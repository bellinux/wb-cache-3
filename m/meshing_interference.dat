In this paper, considering elastic deformation of gear pair, using orthogonal design to obtain the optimal isometric modification parameters, and then using the optimal isometric modification parameters and symmetric crowned modification parameters to modify tooth separately. Three-dimensional solid models of standard gears and modification gears are established by SolidWorks, then dynamic contact FEA is carried out based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA.

40|$|Screen {{printing}}, {{unlike other}} printing processes, requires ink {{to be pushed}} through the image carrier to the substrate. When the mesh threads and their intersections cross the image area, they act as obstructions to the ink flow. In large image areas, the effect of <b>mesh</b> <b>interference</b> is minimal. In fine detail screen printing, <b>mesh</b> <b>interference</b> is a primary cause of poor or inaccurate resolution. The trend in screen printing has been toward more and finer fine line, halftone and four-color process printing. Researching methods to minimize <b>mesh</b> <b>interference</b> will enable screen printers to gain greater control over the printing process and better utilize technologies currently available for fine detail reproduction. Previous experiments had shown that the angle of a fine line image relative to the mesh threads will {{have an effect on}} resolution quality. This thesis developed a theoretical model for hypothesizing that image angle may also affect resolution in halftone screen printing. A fine line test image was developed to attempt to reproduce the results of experiments indicating a critical angle exists for fine lines, and to determine if the direction of the squeegee motion is also a factor. Halftone gray scales screened at all of the common four-color and black and white reproduction angles, {{as well as at the}} aforementioned hypothesized fine line critical angle, were used to determine if image angle has an effect on reproduceable tonal range and on the accuracy of resolution in halftone screen printing. Exposure and squeegee conditions were optimized, and the test images were printed. Data on fine line and halftone resolution was collected and statistically analyzed to determine if image angle had an effect on the resolution. In all cases, angle was found to have an effect on image resolution. However, no one angle or small range of angles was found to provide significantly better resolution than another. In the fine line test, it appeared that a relationship does exist between image resolution and the direction of squeegee motion. This was not evident in the halftone resolution data. The halftone data, however, does indicate a relationship exists between loss of percent dot area and tonal range. Further investigation of these factors in screen printing is recommended...|$|R

Usually, symmetrical crowning is adopted to improve above phenomenons, however, due to the influence of complicated tooth loads and other complicated factors, the symmetrical crowned gear may not reach a good modification effect. In this paper, we adopt target variable curvature crowning according to the specific conditions of bevel gears in order to obtain good modification effect, nevertheless, because of the complexity of the variable curvature crowning, the conventional method of using space spherical involute stretch and sweep standard gear model to remove tooth surface materials has been unable to meet the accurate requirements of the variable curvature crowned model, at the same time, this method can not realize parametric modeling of modification bevel gear. Therefore, this paper puts forward an easy to realize parametric modeling method of accurate variable curvature crowning for involute {{straight bevel gear}} based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA, Imageware, Matlab and Solidworks. This method can realize the accurate modeling for variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear and ensure the accuracy of modification gears and follow-up finite element simulation, meanwhile, it provides theoretical basis for parametric modeling of variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear. Finally, the superiority of variable curvature crowning is tested through numerical simulation under specific conditions...|$|E

As a result, changing to a lower bit-rate with same synchronization scheme will not make the transmission more resilient to interference.

30|$|We {{assume a}} single mesh gateway (GW). All mesh nodes, except the GW, are sources of flow. The GW is the sink for all flows. We {{formulate}} the MRMC WMN routing problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) whose {{objective is to}} maximize the network throughput while maintaining fairness among the multiple flows subject to flow conservation, half-duplex, and node-degree constraints. The problem of assigning channels to the links involved in routing so that communication among <b>mesh</b> nodes is <b>interference</b> free is similar to the minimum coloring problem for the conflict graph, which is known to be NP-hard for general graphs [8]. This amounts to finding the smallest number of maximal independent sets (MaISs), where the number of channels required is equal to the number of MaISs. To minimize the number of channels required, we use our existing Select x for less than x topology control algorithm (TCA) [2] to build the connectivity graph (CG). By controlling network connectivity, it lowers the transmitted power as much as possible without sacrificing network throughput and so tends to reduce transmitted power throughout the network, which supports green networking for WMNs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Radio {{interference}} {{should be}} taken into account to assign time slots to links in time division multiple access (TDMA) -based wireless mesh networks. In many graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms, the protocol interference model is widely used to obtain radio interference information, although this model is considered to be inaccurate when compared with actual radio interference. On the other hand, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio model (SINR model) is a well-known and accurate model of radio interference. However, the SINR model requires time slot information to obtain radio interference relationship, and thus it is difficult to apply the SINR model to graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms. In this paper, we extend the protocol interference model to represent radio interference more accu-rately for wireless mesh networks. To do this, we adjust the interference ratio parameter of the protocol interference model by considering SINR. We propose three methods for adjusting this parameter. Through simulation, it is shown that higher accuracy of the protocol interference model can be achieved by adjusting the interference ratio parameter for each node.

40|$|Abstract—Wireless mesh {{networks}} are {{considered as a}} potential attractive alternative to provide broadband access to users. They have been studied extensively by the research community since they {{raised a lot of}} new issues due to their unique characteristics. Here, we focus on scenarios where these {{networks are}} installed and managed to provide broadband access to a set of fixed nodes. While a lot of research has been done on this type of networks, there are very few insightful engineering results that can help network operators deploy and manage such networks. It is the objective of this paper to present some major engineering insights on such networks. We limit our scope to networks that are single rate and in which all nodes use the same transmit power. In particular, we quantify the advantage of multi-hop over single-hop. We illustrate the importance of multipath routing over single path routing, and of optimal routing versus min-hop routing. We revisit the notion of spatial reuse. Finally we present results showing the importance of selecting an appropriate interference model.

40|$|In multi-hop {{wireless}} networks such as wireless <b>mesh</b> networks, <b>interference</b> {{from hidden}} nodes {{increases the likelihood}} of packet loss. Such probabilistic packet loss can make the end-to-end packet delivery ratio (PDR) (or throughput) unacceptably bad for many applications that require reliable data transmissions in multi-hop wireless networks. The widely deployed IEEE 802. 11 standard defines a MAC-layer retransmission mechanism for hop-by-hop error recovery. However, sending a packet through a poor-quality wireless link may require many retransmissions to make progress. In multi-hop wireless networks, data transmissions using a routing path formed by multiple poor-quality wireless links may consume excessive amounts of network bandwidth without ensuring a satisfactory end-to-end PDR. This motivates the development of efficient algorithms that can find high-throughput paths for multi-hop wireless routing. The first contribution of this thesis is a cross-layer approach that enables high-throughput routing in multi-hop wireless networks. This approach builds on a MAC-layer cooperative retransmission mechanism, which we call Delta-MAC, which is explicitly designed to exploit the benefits of MAC-layer retransmission for reliability, cooperative communications, and link-quality awareness. Based on this mechanism, we devise a routing metric, called the expected cooperative transmission count (ECTX), that captures the combined effects of MAC-layer cooperative retransmission and per-link estimates of packet delivery ratios. The second contribution of this thesis is low-latency routing that exploits the rate diversity feature of wireless transmission. We design an opportunistic rate-adaptive expected transmission time (ORETT) scheme, which exploits cooperative (relay-aided) retransmissions to achieve high-throughput routing in multi-rate wireless mesh networks. This scheme captures the effects of MAC-layer cooperative retransmission by neighbour nodes with transmission rate diversity (and rate-dependent link quality). In our approach, a relay node is selected among one-hop neighbours to assist with packet retransmissions and minimize the expected retransmission time. The third contribution of this thesis is to present a new routing metric, termed Expected Cooperative Forwarding Delay (ECFD). It selects a minimum end-to-end delay path for multi-hop multi-rate wireless mesh networks. In contrast to previously proposed cooperative-aware routing metrics such as ORETT, the ECFD metric is based on expected cooperative transmission time and also accounts for queueing and backoff delays in the path selection process. This metric ensures that apparently attractive transmission paths will not be overloaded, resulting in excessive delays and packet loss...|$|R

The objective of this project is to design control circuit and integrate electric and electronic devices to the mechanism of the anti theft car seat. This Project involved of Infrared Transmitter circuit and Infrared Receiver circuit of 12 volts DC Motor. The motor will rotate bidirectional due the command of code that has been installing in the microcontroller. The coding inside the microcontroller has been programmed by using the Visual Basic software. PICAXE 14 M microcontroller has been selected for the control circuit because it is very appropriate with this control circuit system and PICAXE 14 M also good for the motor controller. 12 volt of DC motor is connected to control a new mechanism of seat movement which is rack and pinion gearing system and Internal gearing system. The rack and pinion gearing system is the system for the movement forward and backward of the car seat whiles the internal gearing system for bend the backrest of the seat down and up. Both of this mechanism involved of same types of gearing profiles. The types of gear used in this mechanism are the spur gear. A pair of spur gear is mesh together. One essential for correct meshing of the gears is {{that the size of}} the teeth on the pinion {{is the same as the}} size of teeth on the wheel. The pinion is the smallest gear and the larger gear is called the gear wheel. The 10 teeth of the smaller pinion and the 20 teeth of the wheel lay to the parallel axes. The module types used in this gearing system are 1 module. Module is the unit of size that indicates how big or small gear is. It is the ratio of the reference diameter of the gear divided by the number of teeth. The 20 teeth of gear wheel are coupled together with the 40 teeth of gear as the output gear. The purpose used the 40 teeth of output gear because of the gear reduction. The output speed of a DC motor is usually too fast for normal used. Most DC motors at normal operating voltages spin at high RPM or revolutions per minute so it is really necessary to reduce the rate at the wheel spins to suit the normal movement of seat. The gear reduction also can increase the torque of the motor to the output gear. This output gear is attached and mesh together with a rack and the internal gear. A rack is a rectangular prism with gear teeth machined along one side. The internal gear is hollow. The profile and teeth shape is similar as of external gear except that the internal gear had different addendum and dedendum values modified to prevent <b>interference</b> <b>meshes.</b> They are used in planetary gears to produce large reduction ratios. The gear ratio is the relationship between the numbers of teeth on two gears that are meshed. In this project all the gear ratio is 1 : 2.
