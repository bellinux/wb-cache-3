40|$|Aims This study {{examined}} whether parental drinking <b>motives</b> {{are associated with}} young adults' drinking <b>motives,</b> and their association with young adults' drinking behaviors. Methods: The sample consisted of 290 18 -year-old and 289 20 -year-old drinking young adults and their parents. Results: For the younger group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> were related to stronger social and enhancement <b>motives,</b> while stronger paternal coping <b>motives</b> were associated with stronger young adult coping <b>motives.</b> For the older group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> were related to stronger social <b>motives</b> and stronger paternal enhancement <b>motives</b> were associated with stronger overall young adult drinking <b>motives.</b> For the younger group, both enhancement and conformity <b>motives</b> were predictive of their alcohol use. For the older group, only higher social <b>motives</b> were predictive of higher alcohol use. Both groups' higher coping and enhancement <b>motives</b> were associated with more drinking problems. Conclusions: While, concerning content, there are some differences due to parent gender and adolescent age, stronger parental drinking <b>motives</b> are indeed associated with stronger adolescent drinking <b>motives,</b> which in turn are quite consistently related to more adolescent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems...|$|R

The <b>Motives</b> for Parasuicide Questionnaire (MPQ), comprising 14 suggested <b>motives,</b> was presented to 53 patients at a psychiatric ward that specialized in suicide attempters. Escape <b>motives</b> were very common, whereas interpersonal <b>motives</b> were rare. Patients with substance abuse, anxiety, or personality disorders more often chose communicating <b>motives</b> and mentioned higher numbers of <b>motives</b> than those with mood or adjustment disorders. Hopelessness was positively associated with a stated wish to die and with escape <b>motives,</b> and negatively correlated to communicating/unclear <b>motives.</b> Suicidal intent was related to some <b>motives.</b> The psychiatric disorder or mental state seems to be more important than socio-demographic characteristics for the choice of <b>motives.</b> Further studies are required to investigate the associations between psychiatric features and <b>motives,</b> as well as the clinical usefulness of such assessments...|$|R

40|$|High heavy {{drinking}} prevalence persists in students. Recently, drinking motivation {{received a lot}} of attention as an important determinant. Enhancement and coping <b>motives</b> are mostly positively related and conformity <b>motives</b> are mostly negatively related with {{heavy drinking}}. Relations are less clear for social <b>motives.</b> This study aimed at gaining more insight in the role of drinking <b>motives</b> in heavy drinking students. Overall, 15 897 Belgian university and college students (mean age: 20. 7, SD = 2. 6) anonymously participated in an online survey. Logistic regressions tested relationships between <b>motives</b> and problematic drinking (>weekly drinking, ≥monthly binge drinking and being at risk for problematic drinking by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]). Social <b>motives</b> had the highest prevalence, followed by enhancement, coping and conformity <b>motives.</b> Men engaged more in problematic drinking and reported more <b>motives,</b> except for coping. Enhancement, coping and social-motivated students have higher chances for problematic drinking, while the opposite is true for conformity-motivated students. Although this study found a similar ranking of <b>motives</b> as in other studies, a relationship between problematic drinking and all <b>motives,</b> including social <b>motives,</b> was revealed. This might indicate the different functions of social <b>motives</b> in heavy drinking in different cultures/sub-populations and countries. This finding is relevant for the development of interventions...|$|R
40|$|Drinking <b>motives</b> {{are among}} the most {{proximal}} factors for drinking behavior and serve as a mechanism through which more distal factors are mediated. However, it is less clear whether drinking <b>motives</b> are precursors of drinking or, in contrast, shaped by previous drinking experiences (reciprocal effects), or both. Moreover, in adults it is unclear whether drinking <b>motives,</b> usually shaped in adolescence, influence each other over time. In this longitudinal study (N = 2440, 47 % women, average age 53 years), drinking <b>motives</b> and drinking behavior (i. e., number of drinks on the heaviest drinking day and number of drinking days; both during the past week) were assessed at 2 time points, separated by 3 months. Full cross-lagged regression models revealed that drinking <b>motives</b> were positively associated with drinking behavior over time and that drinking <b>motives</b> are shaped by the number of drinking days (i. e., reciprocal effects). Furthermore, coping and enhancement <b>motives,</b> as well as social and conformity <b>motives,</b> positively reinforced each other. Moreover, social <b>motives</b> were positively associated with enhancement <b>motives</b> over time. In conclusion, drinking <b>motives</b> influence each other over a 3 -month period in adulthood and predict drinking behavior over time, making them important candidates for prevention efforts. Drinking <b>motives</b> are likely to be modifiable and might be used to stimulate drinking decrease...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{consumer}} {{food choices}} {{is crucial to}} stimulate sustainable food consumption. Food choice <b>motives</b> are shown to be relevant in understanding consumer food choices. However, there is a focus on product <b>motives,</b> such as price and taste, whereas process <b>motives</b> (i. e. environmental welfare) are understudied. The current study aims {{to add to the}} existing literature by investigating the added value of sustainable process <b>motives</b> (environmental welfare, animal welfare and social justice) above product <b>motives.</b> Two on-line surveys of representative Dutch samples tested whether process <b>motives</b> increase the explained variance of sustainable consumption. The results indicate that sustainable process <b>motives</b> are of added value above product <b>motives</b> in the understanding of consumer food choices. In addition, product categories differ in the sustainable process <b>motives</b> that are most useful in explaining sustainable purchases in that category (Study 1), and different types of sustainable products (organic versus fair trade) differ in the sustainable process <b>motives</b> that are most useful in explaining these purchases (Study 2). In conclusion, this paper shows that understanding of sustainable consumption can be improved by considering sustainable process <b>motives</b> above product <b>motives.</b> Thereby, it is important to take the sustainability dimension (e. g., social justice versus environmental welfare) and the product category (e. g., meat versus fruit) into account...|$|R

At baseline and 15 months later, 4, 575 men (mean age = 19. 4) in Switzerland completed a questionnaire assessing drinking <b>motives,</b> average weekly consumption, risky single-occasion drinking, and alcohol-related consequences. Results indicated that social and enhancement <b>motives</b> more strongly influenced alcohol use over time than the other way round. Coping <b>motives</b> predicted an increase in alcohol-related consequences, and vice versa. Higher social <b>motives</b> predicted an increase in coping <b>motives</b> while higher coping <b>motives</b> predicted a decrease in enhancement <b>motives.</b> These results suggest that social and enhancement <b>motives</b> amplify each other in early adulthood and predict increases in risky drinking.
