50|$|Another {{way to look}} at the {{monetary}} multiplier is derived from the concept of money supply and <b>money</b> <b>base.</b> It is the number of dollars of money supply that can be created for every dollar of monetary base. Money supply, denoted by M, is the stock of money held by public. It is measured by the amount of currency and deposits. <b>Money</b> <b>Base,</b> denoted by B, is the summation of currency and reserves. Currency and Reserves are monetary policy that can be affected by the Federal Reserve. For example, the Federal Reserve can increase currency by printing more money and they can similarly increase reserve by requiring a higher percentage of deposits to be stored in the Federal Reserve.|$|E

5000|$|According to De Grauwe, {{none of the}} {{arguments}} is valid for the following reason: (1) The money stock does not necessarily increase if the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> is increased. (2) All open market operations generate taxpayer risk, and if the lender of last resort is successful in preventing countries from moving into the bad equilibrium, it will not suffer any losses. (3) The risk of moral hazard {{is identical to the}} moral hazard in the financial market and should be overcome by risk-limiting regulation. (4) If the distinction between illiquid and insolvent were possible, the market would not need the support of the lender of last resort, but in practice, the distinction cannot be made. (5) While Article 21 of the treaty prohibits buying debt from national governments directly because it [...] "implies a monetary financing of the government budget deficit," [...] Article 18 allows the ECB to buy and sell [...] "marketable instruments," [...] and government bonds are marketable instruments. Finally, De Grauwe asserts that only the central bank itself has the necessary credibility to act as a lender of last resort and so it should replace the European Financial Stability Facility (and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism). The two institutions cannot guarantee that they will always possess enough liquidity or [...] "fire power" [...] to buy debt from sovereign bond holders.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the problems posed by Japans recent macroeconomic experience for conventional monetary policy theory and practice. Japans experience with deflation and the zero lower bound for nominal official interest rates {{is placed in}} the context of neo-Wicksellian and monetarist interpretations of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The neo-Wicksellian approach to the zero bound problem is shown to suffer significant limitations in view of Japans experience, while a monetarist interpretation of the transmission mechanism is shown to be more robust. The thesis considers the role of the official interest rate and the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> in vector autoregression models of the Japanese economy, finding that the economy became less amenable to effective stabilisation by monetary policy from the early 1990 s onwards. A new approach to estimating a neo-Wicksellian monetary policy rule for the Bank of Japan is proposed and the robustness of the parameters of this rule determined. The thesis motivates a role for the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> in the determination of real output and inflation. A policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal <b>money</b> <b>base</b> is estimated and the stability of its parameters with respect to a hypothesised structural break and changes in the governorship of the Bank of Japan is considered. Aggregate demand and supply specifications for the Japanese economy are estimated that show a distinct role for the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> that is independent of the official interest rate. These specifications are extended to develop a model of the Japanese economy. The model is distinctive in incorporating both neo-Wicksellian and monetarist views of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The macroeconomic stabilisation properties of various interest rate and <b>money</b> <b>base</b> growth rules are compared {{in the context of the}} model, using stochastic simulation methods. In particular, a policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal <b>money</b> <b>base</b> with the nominal official interest rate set to zero is simulated and shown to have macroeconomic stabilisation properties that compare favourably to conventional interest rate rules. The thesis concludes that the neglect of money in contemporary monetary policy theory and practice is mistaken in view of Japans recent macroeconomic experience...|$|E

40|$|Australian {{monetary}} {{economists have}} {{for some time}} been intermittently concerned with {{the relationship between the}} monetary base and the money stock. Controversy has centred around a number of issues, including: the exogeneity of the money base; the substitutability of cash and other liquid assets in the management of banks’ reserves; the causal significance of the budget deficit of the consolidated government sector relative to imported disturbances; and the appropriate definition of the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> in Australia. This paper provides some additional evidence relevant to this debate. Changes in the financial system during the last two decades, including partial deregulation of the banking system, and the growth of finance companies and permanent building societies, suggest the need for a careful examination of the money/money base relationship. These changes are likely to have altered both the time series properties of the monetary aggregates and may also have changed the observed relationship between various measures of <b>money</b> <b>base</b> and the money stock. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that this may have occurred. The analysis is directed towards three questions. Does the money multiplier vary significantly in terms of its stability with differing measures of money and <b>money</b> <b>base?</b> What is the behavioural significance of differences in stability? How does the causal relationship between money and <b>money</b> <b>base</b> vary over time and with different concepts of base and money? Graphical, numerical and time series analysis are used to shed light on these issues. The results are in some cases conflicting due to the strigent techniques for determining causality but we conclude: • there is evidence of considerable instability in the money multiplier for most concepts of <b>money</b> <b>base</b> during the 60 s and 70 s. Financial innovation may have been important in this instability. The timing of significant changes in the financial system is consistent with observed instabilities of the multipliers; • the evidence suggests that the M 2 money multiplier for the extended base is the most stable for both the sixties and seventies; • there is evidence of contemporaneous correlation between <b>money</b> <b>base</b> measures and the money stock (for M 2 and M 3) but that the results for the seventies indicate the presence of both a positive causal effect on the money supply from innovations in the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> and feedback effects from the money stock to money base; • there is evidence of some structural change in the time series models for some aggregates between the late sixties and the late seventies; in addition, there is evidence of a structural change within the sixties relating primarily to the private sector’s demand for cash relative to other monetary aggregates and to the growth of the permanent building societies. ...|$|E
