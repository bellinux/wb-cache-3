40|$|The main {{challenge}} of an augmented reality {{system is to}} obtain perfect alignment between real and virtual objects {{in order to create}} the illusion that both worlds coexist. To that end, the position and orientation of the observer has to be determined in order to configure a virtual camera that displays the virtual objects in their corresponding position. This problem is known as tracking, and although there are many alternatives to address it by using different sensors, tracking based on optical sensors is the most popular solution. However, optical tracking is not a solved problem. This thesis presents a study of the existing optical tracking methods and provides some improvements for some of them, particularly for those that are real time. More precisely, <b>monocular</b> <b>optical</b> marker tracking and model-based <b>monocular</b> <b>optical</b> markerless tracking are discussed in detail. The proposed improvements are focused on industrial environments, which is a difficult challenge {{due to the lack of}} texture in these scenes. <b>Monocular</b> <b>optical</b> marker tracking methods do not support occlusions, so this thesis proposes two alternatives: (1) a new tracking method based on temporal coherence, and (2) a new marker design. Both solutions are robust against occlusions and do not require more environment adaptation. Similarly, the response of model-based <b>monocular</b> <b>optical</b> markerless tracking methods is jeopardized in untextured scenes, so this thesis proposes a 3 D object recognition method that uses geometric properties instead of texture to initialize the tracking, as well as a markerless tracking method that uses multiple visual cues to update the tracking. Additionally, the details of the augmented reality system that has been developed to help in disassembly operations are given throughout the thesis. This serves as a tool to validate the proposed methods and it also shows their real world applicability...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} system for {{increasing}} <b>optical</b> <b>instrument</b> calibration and prediction accuracy {{within and across}} different <b>optical</b> <b>instrument</b> platforms can comprise two main submethods or routines. The first routine can include one for correcting differences among <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> of different model types regardless of the manufacturer and correcting differences among <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> of the same model type. The second main routine or sub-method can include one for analyzing new samples of a product over time and maintaining prediction accuracy as compared to a reference method over time. The first routine can include a "TRANS" procedure, a "MIN" procedure, and checkcell tests. The second main routine provides techniques on how a product database can be cleaned, condensed, and expanded automatically as it is used {{by one or more}} different <b>optical</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
