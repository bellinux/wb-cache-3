40|$|Mobile {{blogging}} {{is a novel}} form of blogging {{in which}} users upload blog contents to the web via mobile devices. Although mobile blogging has been popularly used in many countries, such as Japan and America, its utilization rate in Taiwan is still low. In such case research on the acceptance of this new technology in Taiwan and the impact on marketing strategy is inevitable. In past two decades, numerous theories and models in regard to technology acceptance have been developed. In this research, we apply three of them, namely Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Combined TAM and Theory of Planned Behavior (C-TAM-TPB) and Revised Technology Acceptance Model (RTAM). Subsequently, eleven hypotheses explaining the user acceptance (behavior intention and action use) of mobile blogging are postulated and validated by conducting research based on questionnaires during March to May of 2009. All subjects are the <b>mobile</b> <b>blog</b> users in Taiwan. The total number of respondents is 384, of which 351 are effective. By statistical analysis, all three models show GFI higher than 0. 8 which indicate their high degree of adaptability. However, only eight (out of eleven) hypotheses are significant. (1) More positive the perceived ease of use, the more positive the perceived usefulness is. (2) More positive the perceived ease of use, the more positive the attitude toward use is. (3) More positive the perceived usefulness, the more positive the attitude toward use is. (4) More positive the attitude toward use, the more positive the behavioral intention is. (5) More positive the behavioral intention, the more positive the action behavior is. (6) More positive the attitude toward use, the more positive the action behavioral is. (7) More positive the subjective norm, the more positive the behavioral intention is. (8) More positive the perceived behavioral control, the more positive the behavioral intention is. To validate the insignificancy of other three hypotheses, we revised the TAM, C-TAM-TPB and RTAM by excluding these hypotheses and found slightly increase in the GFIs. Thus reconfirm that perceived usefulness {{does not have any}} impact on either behavior intention or action use. Perceived control behavior does not have impact on the action use. From an informal interview of a few experienced mobile bloggers, we have also found that social impact is actually one important factor influencing the behavior intention, which re-iterates the results analyzed from the questionnaires collected. Concluding from these analysis results, it is suggested that (1) coupon or cash rebate for active mobile bloggers, (2) bundling mobile blogs with other entertainment services should be two strategies that service providers should take into account to increase the users' attitude towards using <b>mobile</b> <b>blog.</b> Service providers should improve their <b>mobile</b> <b>blog</b> interface by adding more instructive manual for new bloggers and new functions, and even a forum for bloggers to exchange their opinions in the usability of the interface. Thus could improve the perceived ease of use and the usefulness of their blogging services. Besides, service providers should develop online platform for these communities to spread out the advantages of using <b>mobile</b> <b>blog</b> and thus enrich the knowledge of a mobile blogger on <b>mobile</b> <b>blog.</b> In the end, a large group of mobile bloggers could be maintained. This research can facilitate Taiwan's companies, which provide mobile blogging services and related business, to adjust their corporate strategies and tactics for customer-oriented mobile blogging services摘要	i Abstract	ii Contents	i List of Table	iii List of Figure	iv Chapter 1 Introduction	 1 1. 1 Research Procedure	 2 Chapter 2 Literature Survey	 4 2. 1 About Mobile Blogging	 4 2. 1. 1 About Blog	 5 2. 1. 2 What are Mobile Blogging and its History?	 6 2. 2 Technology Acceptance Model	 6 2. 2. 1 Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) 	 7 2. 2. 2 Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) 	 8 2. 2. 3 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 	 8 2. 2. 4 C-TAM-TPB	 10 2. 2. 5 Revised Technology Acceptance Model	 11 2. 2. 6 Revised Technology Acceptance Model (Taiwan) 	 12 Chapter 3 Research Method	 13 3. 1 Research Structure & Hypotheses	 13 3. 2 Research Design	 17 3. 3 Survey Method	 19 Chapter 4 Research Analysis	 20 4. 1 Descriptive Statistics	 20 4. 2.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of communication technology, {{it becomes a}} reality to hear or watch anything, anywhere. Applications such as audio/video streaming, digital libraries, on-line businesses, and live camera remote surveillance are widely deployed. Users {{will be able to}} access these services anytime, anywhere, and using any computing device in a pervasive way. For example, a user may bring a PDA on a field trip, carry a laptop (with both wireless and wired network cards) on a business trip, use high performance workstations at work, and use desktop PCs at home (with dial-up, cable, or DSL connection). In another example, a user continues to watch the soccer game over home TV, while he watches the game through a mobile device out of home. Some other applications include mobile games and entertainment, <b>mobile</b> <b>blog,</b> mobile community, home network, smart home services, etc. Since these multimedia applications are constructed on the convergence of various networks, such as wired or wireless networks, broadcasting or multicasting networks, broadband or band-limited networks, and devices (e. g.

Records in the form of multimedia created through <b>mobile</b> <b>blogging</b> can assist people to keep a versatile representation of artefacts they encounter on the move in everyday life. Overseas students are an example of a large group of people whose cultural learning could be supported by this technology. They could share contextual information and their own stories with other people currently experiencing the host culture, as well as people who do not have the opportunity to experience the host culture first-hand. To examine and evaluate how the <b>mobile</b> group <b>blog</b> could be applied in learning, a case study was conducted on involving overseas students. This research explored the suitability, appropriateness and benefits of a <b>mobile</b> group <b>blog</b> in assisting overseas students to manage their culture shock. It illustrates how the mobility of mobile devices assists the capture of contextual information on the move when overseas students start adapting to the new environment. The group blog site provided a platform to share and exchange their experiences and thoughts, as well as a resource of information on authentic cultural transition for future students. Four sub-studies were conducted around this theme. The first two studies investigated the demands and needs of a <b>mobile</b> group <b>blog</b> application in cultural transition. The third study investigated real and practical <b>mobile</b> <b>blogging</b> activities with a group of twelve Chinese overseas students who had newly arrived in Nottingham.
