In {{his early years}} while still a television director, Robert Altman stated that {{when he first saw}} Rashomon he was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work. It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, [...] "One thing that distinguishes [...] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, eight masterpieces." [...] Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model, and Scorsese called him his [...] "sensei," [...] using the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, [...] "I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker {{on the face of the}} earth", while Scorsese remarked, [...] "Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was <b>my</b> <b>master,</b> and... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years." [...] Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on Kagemusha, while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, Dreams, helped bring that picture to fruition.|$|E
