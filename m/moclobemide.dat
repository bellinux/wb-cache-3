25|$|In a {{study of}} 1022 outpatients, overall sexual {{dysfunction}} with all antidepressants averaged 59.1% with SSRIs values between 57 and 73%, mirtazapine 24%, nefazodone 8%, amineptine 7% and <b>moclobemide</b> 4%. <b>Moclobemide,</b> a selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor, does not cause sexual dysfunction, and can actually lead to an improvement {{in all aspects of}} sexual function.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{reversible}} MAOI antidepressant drug <b>moclobemide,</b> {{significantly more}} impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone.|$|E
25|$|Hyperorgasmia, is the {{experience}} of a significantly larger number of orgasms {{in a short period of}} time than what is normal. It has been reported to occur as a side effect of the antidepressant drug, <b>moclobemide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that sertraline {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to <b>moclobemide,</b> nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and mirtazapine. There is low quality evidence that sertraline is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|Citalopram is well tolerated and as {{effective}} as <b>moclobemide</b> in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram {{can be useful in}} reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer’s disease.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. It is similar in efficacy to the antidepressant drug <b>moclobemide.</b> It has also been used to treat nocturnal enuresis because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, imipramine is used with xylazine to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and <b>moclobemide.</b> A clinical trial has been conducted to compare its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results of this trial showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, <b>moclobemide,</b> phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} drug {{interactions}} can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Concurrent use of MDMA high dosages with another serotonergic drug {{can result in}} a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or <b>moclobemide</b> (Aurorix, Manerix).|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine shows {{efficacy}} against serious depressive episodes (major depression), {{comparable to}} amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It {{was shown to}} be more effective than maprotiline in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety. Tianeptine also displays significant anxiolytic properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% CO2 gas (carbogen) on paroxetine or tianeptine therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects. Like many antidepressants (including bupropion, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, <b>moclobemide</b> and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with depression-induced cognitive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Other {{prescription}} drugs are also used, if other methods are not effective. Before {{the introduction of}} SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine were frequently used {{in the treatment of}} social anxiety. Evidence continues to indicate that MAOIs are effective in the treatment and management of social anxiety disorder and they are still used, but generally {{only as a last resort}} medication, owing to concerns about dietary restrictions, possible adverse drug interactions and a recommendation of multiple doses per day. A newer type of this medication, Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase subtype A (RIMAs) such as the drug <b>moclobemide,</b> bind reversibly to the MAO-A enzyme, greatly reducing the risk of hypertensive crisis with dietary tyramine intake.|$|E
25|$|Dietary taboos {{are often}} {{associated}} with the use of ayahuasca. In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in foods containing tyramine has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of tyramine and MAOIs could lead to a hypertensive crisis. However, evidence indicates that harmala alkaloids act only on MAO-A, in a reversible way similar to <b>moclobemide</b> (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church União do Vegetal, suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} the TCAs {{were the first}} choice for {{pharmacological}} treatment of clinical depression. Although they are still considered to be highly effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI <b>moclobemide.</b> However, tricyclic antidepressants are possibly more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants {{are thought to have}} fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially lethal overdose (see therapeutic index) are far wider in comparison.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must not}} be given in {{combination}} or within 3 weeks before or after treatment with an monoamine oxidase inhibitor. (<b>Moclobemide</b> included, however clomipramine can be initiated sooner at 48 hours following discontinuation of <b>moclobemide.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with parenteral epinephrine, norepinephrine, with clonidine, reversible MAO-A Inhibitors (such as <b>moclobemide,</b> toloxatone) or 5-HT1D-agonists (e.g. triptan migraine drugs) ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{concluded that}} antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, {{and sleep in}} fibromyalgia syndrome. Tricyclics {{appear to be the}} most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% versus 28% for placebo. For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common. Antidepressants including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, milnacipran, <b>moclobemide,</b> and pirlindole are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on [...] "limited evidence".|$|E
2500|$|Both {{forms of}} the drug carry {{warnings}} about food restrictions, to avoid hypertensive crisis {{that are associated with}} MAO inhibitors. [...] The patch form of the drug was created in part to overcome the issues with food restrictions: the clinical trials did not include food restrictions, and no hypertensive crisis during the course of them. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor <b>moclobemide,</b> require a low tyramine diet.|$|E
2500|$|Clomipramine may {{interact}} {{with a number}} of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, <b>moclobemide,</b> phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine {{due to the fact that}} clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 [...] ) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moclobemide</b> {{has fewer}} {{interactions}} than irreversible MAOIs. Cimetidine, however, causes a significant rise in <b>moclobemide</b> levels and therefore if the combination is used, lower doses of <b>moclobemide</b> have been recommended. There is little {{increase in the}} effects of alcohol when combined with <b>moclobemide</b> and, in fact, <b>moclobemide</b> causes a reduction in alcohol-related impairments. <b>Moclobemide</b> also interacts with pethidine/meperidine, and dextropropoxyphene. Ephedrine in combination with <b>moclobemide</b> {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular adverse effects. <b>Moclobemide</b> is also likely to interact with warfarin.The combination of <b>moclobemide</b> with prescription or over the counter sympathomimetic drugs is not recommended due to the potential of significant drug interactions.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sold under}} many trade names {{worldwide}} including Apo-Moclob, Apo-Moclobemide, Auromid, Aurorix, Bei Su, Biorix, Depnil, Eutac, Hai Bei Lin, Langtian, Manerix, Mobemid, Moclamine, Moclo A, Moclobemid - 1 A Pharma, Moclobemid AL, Moclobemid HEXAL, Moclobemid ratiopharm, Moclobemida, Moclobemida Genedec, Moclobemida Teva, <b>Moclobemide</b> Actavis, <b>Moclobemide</b> Aurobindo, <b>Moclobemide</b> CF, <b>Moclobemide</b> Mylan, <b>Moclobemide</b> Sandoz, <b>Moclobemide</b> Sopharma, <b>Moclobemide</b> Teva, Moclobemid-neuraxpharm, Moclobemid-ratiopharm, Moclobeta, Moclod, moclodura, Moclostad, Mocrim, Modafinil Arrow, Moklar, Teva-Moclobemide, Tian Tai, Ya Zheng, and Zorix.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moclobemide</b> {{increases}} {{levels of}} extracellular monoamines and decreases levels of their metabolites in rat brains; tolerance to these effects {{does not seem}} to occur with chronic use of <b>moclobemide.</b> <b>Moclobemide</b> lacks anticholinergic effects and cognitive impairments can be improved by <b>moclobemide.</b> <b>Moclobemide</b> suppresses the unstimulated release of certain proinflammatory cytokines which are believed {{to be involved in the}} pathophysiology of major depression and stimulates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Long-term treatment with <b>moclobemide</b> leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).|$|E
50|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} {{has been}} reported when <b>moclobemide</b> has been taken {{in combination with other}} serotonin enhancing drugs; however, due to moclobemide's reversible MAO inhibition, serotonin syndrome is significantly less likely to occur with <b>moclobemide</b> than with older irreversible MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported}} when trazodone was abruptly replaced with <b>moclobemide.</b> Taking at the same time or starting <b>moclobemide</b> too soon after discontinuing clomipramine, or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as SSRIs may result {{in the development of a}} serotonin syndrome. SNRIs, such as venlafaxine in combination with <b>moclobemide</b> have also been associated with serotonin syndrome. Cimetidine, causes a doubling of the blood plasma levels of <b>moclobemide.</b> Blood plasma levels of trimipramine and maprotiline and possibly other tricyclic antidepressants increase when used in combination with <b>moclobemide</b> and may require dosage adjustments if the combination is used for treatment resistant depression. The elimination of zolmitriptan is reduced by <b>moclobemide</b> and if the combination is used, a dosage reduction of zolmitriptan is recommended. <b>Moclobemide</b> reduces the metabolism of dextromethorphan.|$|E
50|$|Smoking cessation. <b>Moclobemide</b> {{has been}} tested in heavy {{dependent}} smokers against placebo based {{on the theory that}} tobacco smoking could be a form of self-medicating of major depression, and <b>moclobemide</b> could therefore help increase abstinence rates due to <b>moclobemide</b> mimicking the MAO-A inhibiting effects of tobacco smoke. <b>Moclobemide</b> was administered for 3 months and then stopped; at 6 months follow-up it was found those who had taken <b>moclobemide</b> for 3 months had a much higher successful quit rate than those in the placebo group. However, at 12-month follow-up the difference between the placebo group and the <b>moclobemide</b> group was no longer significant.|$|E
50|$|In {{healthy people}} <b>moclobemide</b> has a {{relatively}} small suppressing effect on REM sleep; in contrast, depressed {{people who have been}} treated with <b>moclobemide,</b> progressively show improved sleep over a 4-week period, with an increase in stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. There have been conflicting findings with regard to <b>moclobemide</b> altering cortisol levels and whether <b>moclobemide</b> increases growth hormone levels. Testosterone levels increase significantly with long-term use of <b>moclobemide</b> in depressed males.|$|E
50|$|The {{doses of}} <b>moclobemide</b> in breast milk are very low (0.06% of <b>moclobemide</b> being {{recovered}} in breast milk) {{and therefore it}} has been concluded that <b>moclobemide</b> is unlikely to have any adverse effect on a suckling baby.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{described}} as a 'slow binding inhibitor', whereby conformational changes to either <b>moclobemide</b> or the enzyme to MAO-A slowly form a more tightly bound complex, resulting in the non-competitive MAO inhibition by <b>moclobemide.</b> With three times daily dosing the inhibition on MAO-A was relatively constant with <b>moclobemide.</b> The MAO inhibition of <b>moclobemide</b> lasts about 8-10 hours and wears off completely by 24 hours after dosing. The inhibition of MAO-A by <b>moclobemide</b> is 10 times more potent than the irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and approximately equivalent to tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid.|$|E
50|$|Reversible MAOIs such as <b>moclobemide</b> {{may have}} {{advantages}} {{in the treatment}} of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease due to its effect on noradrenaline. Cognitive impairments have been found to improve in people with dementia when depression is treated with <b>moclobemide.</b> Due to its superior safety profile, <b>moclobemide</b> has been recommended as a first line agent for the treatment of depression in the elderly. Due to the side effect profile of <b>moclobemide,</b> it may be a better option for this sub group of people than other antidepressants. Research has found evidence that <b>moclobemide</b> may be able to counter cholinergic induced cognitive impairments thus making <b>moclobemide</b> a good choice in the depression in the elderly and those with dementia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Moclobemide.</b> <b>Moclobemide</b> is advised not to {{be started}} until at least one week after {{treatment}} with TCAs is discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to other}} MAOIs, {{reversible}} MAOIs such as <b>moclobemide</b> {{may also be}} effective {{in a range of}} other psychiatric disorders. Menopausal flushing may also respond to <b>moclobemide.</b> <b>Moclobemide</b> may also have benefit for some patients with Parkinson's Disease by extending and enhancing the effects of l-dopa.|$|E
50|$|ADHD. Two small studies {{assessing}} {{the benefit of}} <b>moclobemide</b> in people with attention deficit disorder found that <b>moclobemide</b> produced favourable results.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of adverse events is not correlated with age; however, adverse events occur {{more often in}} females than in males. <b>Moclobemide</b> {{is regarded as a}} generally safe antidepressant and due to its favorable side effect profile, it can be considered a first-line therapeutic antidepressant. Side effects of <b>moclobemide</b> are exceptionally low, with insomnia, headache and dizziness being the most commonly reported side effects in the initial stages of therapy with <b>moclobemide.</b> Many antidepressants have an adverse effect on sexual function; however, treatment with <b>moclobemide</b> has actually been found to improve sexual function. <b>Moclobemide</b> does not have any adverse effect on cognitive abilities, thus there are no impairments of <b>moclobemide</b> therapy on memory, attention functions nor is ability to drive a motor vehicle affected adversely. In fact, <b>moclobemide</b> has been found to improve cognition, especially memory; this is relevant with regard to the elderly as adverse effects on cognition are of particular concern in this population. People with dementia and comorbid depression also show improvements in cognitive impairments; these improvements are unrelated to alleviation of depression. Alcohol related cognitive impairments are also improved by <b>moclobemide.</b> Improvements in cognition also occur in young depressed people after 6 weeks of treatment. There is a mild impairment in psychometric performance in elderly people but none in younger people. <b>Moclobemide,</b> even at high doses of 600 mg, does not impair the ability to drive a motor vehicle. The tolerability of <b>moclobemide</b> is similar in women and men and it is also well tolerated in the elderly. <b>Moclobemide</b> is tolerated to a similar degree to the SSRI antidepressants, although unlike SSRIs <b>moclobemide</b> does not cause sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal disturbance is less common. <b>Moclobemide</b> {{has been found to be}} superior to tricyclic and irreversible MAOI antidepressants in terms of side effects, as it does not cause anticholinergic, sedative or cardiovascular adverse effects as well as not causing weight gain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moclobemide</b> {{also has}} neuroprotective {{properties}} in its demonstrated anti-hypoxia or anti-ischemia effects; {{there is a}} possibility that <b>moclobemide</b> may possess similar neuro-rescuing properties, similar to selegiline, however, research is required to determine this. <b>Moclobemide</b> has also been demonstrated in a single dose research study to possess antinociceptive properties.|$|E
50|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{appear to}} be very rare with <b>moclobemide</b> compared to other antidepressants; a single report of relatively mild flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 days after rapid reduction of high dose <b>moclobemide</b> therapy {{has been reported in}} one patient. Withdrawal of <b>moclobemide</b> causes a rebound in REM sleep.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{irreversible}} MAOIs {{there is}} no evidence of liver toxicity with <b>moclobemide.</b> <b>Moclobemide</b> has a similar efficacy profile compared to other antidepressants but is significantly superior to the tricyclic antidepressants and the classic (unselective or irreversible) MAOIs, in terms of tolerance and safety profile. <b>Moclobemide</b> has little effect on psychomotor functions. Other side effects include, nausea, insomnia, tremor and lightheadedness; orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing) is uncommon even among the elderly. Behavioural toxicity or other impairments relating to everyday living does not occur with <b>moclobemide,</b> except in doses of 400 mg or higher, peripheral reaction time may be impaired. Peripheral oedema has been associated with <b>moclobemide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Moclobemide</b> is {{chemically}} {{unrelated to}} irreversible MAOI antidepressants and {{only has a}} very weak pressor effect of orally administered tyramine. In humans, the n-oxide metabolites of <b>moclobemide</b> and <b>moclobemide</b> itself are the compounds that produce most of the inhibition of MAO-A; other metabolites are significantly less potent than the parent compound.|$|E
5000|$|Psychotic depression, {{unipolar}} endogenous depression, melancholic depression, retarded depression, agitated {{depression and}} neurotic depression all respond to <b>moclobemide.</b> As does atypical depression. Unipolar endogenous depression {{is reported to}} have the best response to <b>moclobemide</b> therapy. Individuals suffering from depression who are given <b>moclobemide</b> {{are twice as likely to}} improve on <b>moclobemide</b> than on placebo. A concern of antidepressant adverse effects is sexual dysfunction; however, <b>moclobemide</b> has actually been found to increase the libido and also improve impaired erection, ejaculation and orgasm. Cardiovascular toxicity is a concern with antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants as well as the irreversible MAOIs; when cardiovascular toxicity is a concern, SSRIs or the reversible MAOIs such as <b>moclobemide</b> are an option as they lack or have a significantly reduced level of cardiovascular toxicity in terms of adverse effect as well as in overdose.|$|E
