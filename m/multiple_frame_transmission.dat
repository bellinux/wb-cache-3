The benefits of adopting two-level packet aggregation have been shown in [11, 12] for the enhancement of network goodput; while experimental studies on packet aggregation were conducted in [13]. Feasible fragmentation and retransmission of packets has been studied in [15, 16] for goodput enhancement with the consideration of contending stations [14]. It has been suggested in [17] to adopt packing, concatenation, and <b>multiple</b> <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in order to reduce}} the MAC/PHY overheads. For goodput enhancement of VoIP traffic, Lu et al. [18] recommended the MAC queue aggregation (MQA) scheme; while Lee et al. [19] exploits intercall aggregation for multihop networks. Nevertheless, most of the existing schemes do not consider the effectiveness of packet aggregation techniques under time-varying channel conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{cellular}} networks, a {{frame size}} is generally made small {{to reduce the}} impact of errors. Thus, a segment of transport layer is splitted into <b>multiple</b> <b>frames</b> before <b>transmission.</b> A {{problem is that the}} whole segment is lost when a frame of a segment is lost. So, the segment error rate tends to be high even though the cellular network provides relatively the low frame error rate, which drops TCP performance. However, the relation between the frame size, the segment size and the error rate has not been closely investigated. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the segment size on TCP performance in cellular networks and propose a scheme alleviating the performance drop of TCP. Our result shows that our scheme reduces the drop by 82 %. ...|$|R

The 802. 11 e MAC is based on both centrally-controlled and contention-based channel accesses. In this paper, we evaluate the contention-based channel access mechanism, called enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF), {{in comparison with the}} 802. 11 legacy MAC. The EDCF provides differentiated channel access to frames with different priorities. We also consider an optional feature of the EDCF, called contention-free burst (CFB), which allows <b>multiple</b> MAC <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> during a single transmission opportunity (TXOP). Through our simulation study, we conclude that the EDCF can provide differentiated channel access for different traffic types. Furthermore, the CFB is found to enhance the EDCF performance by increasing the overall system throughput and achieving more acceptable streaming quality in terms of frame losses and delays...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a simple cooperative diversity scheme for the scenario of two sources sharing a single relay.

We propose a novel computationally efficient message passing algorithm at the destination’s decoder which utilizes spatial diversity gathered over <b>multiple</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>frames.</b> We show that despite {{the simplicity of the}} proposed scheme, diversity gains are efficiently leveraged by the simple combination of channel coding at the sources and network coding at the relay. 1...|$|R
30|$|In the {{approach}} in [2 – 4], the AP centrally coordinates the ACK or NACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients by transmitting the RAK (Request for ACK) or RNAK (Request for NACK) polling frames to the recipients. For example, {{according to the}} BMMM (Batch Mode Multicast MAC) protocol in [3], the AP coordinates the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> by transmitting the separate RAK frames to the recipients. In {{the approach}} in [5], the AP reserves the wireless channel for the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients and coordinates the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients in a strictly sequential order. For the channel reservation for the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the AP knows each ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> time beforehand. However, this assumption cannot be realized generally because the STAs can choose their ACK transmission rates differently according to the wireless channel state. Other approaches in [2, 4, 6 – 8] not based on the AP's polling have also been proposed for the reliable multicast transmission.|$|R

3000|$|For example, {{the phase}} k= 2 {{represents}} the <b>transmission</b> of RTH <b>frames</b> {{and it means}} helper node selection competition. Thus, D_E^ 2 refers to the required time delay for complete failure of the helper node selection procedure. This delay consists of a busy tone signal, HC and EC contention periods, RC slots, and two short CTH <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the HC and EC contentions, respectively. Then, the average time delay from the CCTS <b>frame</b> to complete <b>transmission</b> failure can be expressed as a weighted sum of consumed time delays until complete transmission failure in each phase.

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} networks, frame retransmission is used {{to increase}} reliability {{with the use of}} additional wireless resources. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to reduce the overhead for retransmission. However, they still suffer from performance degradation due to unpredictable wireless channel variation during a <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> in fast-fading environ-ments. In this paper, we propose an in-frame rate adaptation (InFRA) scheme as a solution for mitigating the retransmission overhead. In InFRA, a receiver estimates the channel SNR of incoming symbols and feeds it back to the sender. According to the feedback information, the sender adaptively changes its symbol transmission rate during a <b>frame</b> <b>transmission.</b> In this way, InFRA significantly increases the reliability of <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> even when the channel state changes within a <b>frame</b> <b>transmission.</b> To evaluate the effectiveness of InFRA, we mathematically analyze its performance and compare it with the existing schemes. Finally, our simulation results show that InFRA achieves significant throughput improvements over the other competitive schemes in fast fading channel environments.

40|$|Abstract- The popular IEEE 802. 11 WLAN {{is known}} to achieve {{relatively}} small throughput performance compared to the underlying physical layer (PHY) transmission rate. This is due mainly to the large overheads composed of medium access control (MAC) header, PHY preamble/header, backoff time, acknowledgement (ACK) transmission, and some inter-frame spaces (IFSs). Since these overheads are added to each <b>frame</b> <b>transmission,</b> the throughput degradation is relatively high when the small-size frames are transmitted. In this paper, we present a frame aggregation scheme, which can improve the throughput performance of IEEE 802. 11 WLAN. By aggregating small-size frames into a large frame, we can reduce these overheads relatively. We propose a simple method to implement the frame aggregation into the real testbed using off-the-shelf IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN products via the device driver modifications. The performance of the frame aggregation is evaluated by both the numerical analysis and the actual measurements from the real testbed. According to the measurement results from the real testbed, the frame aggregation can improve the throughput performance of IEEE 802. 11 b WLAN by 2 to 3 Mbps, when <b>multiple</b> <b>frames</b> are aggregated.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the transmission of data between client and server through different IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN multi- HOP network. To improve this issue, the transmission opportunity (TXOP) mechanism is defined in the IEEE 802. 11 e standard, with which a wireless node can transmit <b>multiple</b> <b>frames</b> consecutively for a maximum channel occupancy time, called TXOP limit. This paper considers the performance of the TXOP mechanism for multi-hop wireless networks. Focusing on a three-node chain topology, we model it as a tandem queuing network with two nodes. The E 2 ET is derived and the analysis is validated by simulation. Numerical results show that the TXOP mechanism works well for multi-hop wireless networks. It is also shown that adjusting TXOP limit is significantly important in order to increase the overall throughput. In terms of multi-hop wireless networks, there is little analytical work with regard to the E 2 ET performance. One of the rationales for the analytical difficulty for multi-hop wireless networks is that IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol is too complex to model the behavior of multi-hop <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions...</b>|$|R
