40|$|Abstract. After being {{besieged by}} {{dilemmas}} related to mixing homogeneity and {{air-fuel ratio control}} of the former air-fuel mixers [1, 2], a new air-fuel mixer called Throttle Body Injection Mixer (TBIM), which is of electronic fuel controlled, was developed. To study the mixing characteristics of TBIM, effect of various <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressures</b> (MAPs) and air flowrates (Qa) on TBIM need to be determined. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work is to study the effect of various MAPs and Qa on TBIM in a compressed natural gas (CNG) motorcycle through both the experimental work and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling. Experimental work was first carried out to investigate the MAPs at varying throttle angles for several engine speeds, followed by the corresponding Qa, which was attained through CFD modelling. The findings obtained were then verified through literature support. It was found that both the MAPs and Qa obtained exhibited a good agreement in the trending of graphs with the former works [3, 4, 5]...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} use {{a vacuum}} assisted brake system that greatly increases the force {{applied to the}} vehicle's brakes by its operator. This additional force is supplied by the manifold vacuum generated by air flow being obstructed by the throttle on a running engine. This force is greatly reduced when the engine is running at fully open throttle, as the difference between ambient air <b>pressure</b> and <b>manifold</b> (<b>absolute)</b> air <b>pressure</b> is reduced, and therefore available vacuum is diminished. However, brakes are rarely applied at full throttle; the driver takes the right foot off the gas pedal and moves it to the brake pedal - unless left-foot braking is used.|$|R

This paper focuses on the combustion system development and combustion analysis results for a normally aspirated 0. 43 liter small engine. The inline two cylinder engine used in experiments has been tested {{in a variety of}} normally aspirated modes, using 98 -RON pump gasoline. Test modes were defined by alterations to the induction system, which included carburetion and port fuel injection fuel delivery systems. The results from this paper provide some insight into the combustion effects for small cylinder normally aspirated spark ignition engines. This information provides future direction for the development of smaller engines as oil prices fluctuate and CO 2 emissions begin to be regulated. Small engine combustion is explored with a number of parametric studies, including a range of <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressures</b> up to wide open throttle, engine speeds exceeding 10, 000 rev/min and compression ratios ranging from 9 to 13. Combustion system optimization through compression ratio development enabled the engine to achieve 37 % brake thermal efficiency and 13 bar brake mean effective pressure. Hence, the test engine performance and efficiency results demonstrate that smaller bore engines can match or exceed typical larger bore engines found in passenger vehicles. However, this was only possible after compression ratio optimization to compensate for the higher levels of dissociation, friction and heat losses associated with the small cylinder size. 3 - 5 NovemberOpen Acces...|$|R

This paper provides {{some insight into the}} future direction for developing smaller capacity downsized engines, which will be needed to meet tight CO 2 targets and the world’s future powertrain requirements. This paper focuses on the combustion system development and combustion analysis results for a downsized 0. 43 liter highly turbocharged engine. The inline two cylinder engine used in experiments was specifically designed and constructed to enable 25 bar BMEP. Producing this specific output is one way forward for future passenger vehicle powertrains, enabling in excess of 50 % swept capacity reduction whilst maintaining comparable vehicle performance. Previous experiments and analysis have found that the extent to which larger engines can be downsized while still maintaining equal performance is combustion limited. Hence, small engine combustion is explored over a number of parametric studies, including a range of <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 270 kPa, engine speeds exceeding 10, 000 rev/min and compression ratios ranging from 9 to 13. Experimental results indicate that small engine combustion hurdles can be overcome to reliably extend the specific output to 25 bar BMEP. This {{is believed to be the}} highest recorded specific output for a non-intercooled small spark ignition PFI engine operating on pump gasoline. However, the boosted combustion effects illustrate that the thermal efficiency is highly dependent on the combustion efficiency, which deteriorates rapidly if uncontrolled combustion, specifically knock in the end-gas region is encountered. However, with this combustion system design strategy, potential drive cycle fuel consumption improvements in excess of 20 % are still achievable. 3 - 5 NovemberOpen Acces...|$|R

This function also enables effective detection of misfires, which is an OBD II demand. The fuel injection is fully sequential and {{is dependent on the}} MAP (<b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure).</b> Boost pressure control (L and R engines) utilises a solenoid valve pneumatically connected to the turbocharger’s waste gate.|$|E

50|$|When tuning a MAF-equipped {{vehicle to}} operate in MAFless mode, the MAF is removed. This {{requires}} the use of an alternative method of calculating airflow into the engine, which is also referred to as 'Speed-Density' system, as opposed to a MAF system. On vehicles so equipped, this alternative involves the use of a <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> or MAP, sensor. The MAP sensor measures pressure in the engine's inlet manifold. When coupled with data regarding the engine's revolutions per minute, or RPM, and a table of volumetric efficiency over the operating range of the engine, the MAP sensor can be used by the engine management computer to calculate fuel requirements.|$|E

The ECU samples engine speed, <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> coolant temperature, intake air temperature, throttle position, and battery voltage. Base values for the fueling and ignition timing are each retrieved from a three-dimensional map, and certain sensor values are applied as correction factors, for example, to enrich fueling during wide-throttle acceleration or on cold startup. The MEMS firmware also features a limp-home capability (referred to in the literature as [...] "limited operating strategy") that will substitute a nominal value for any non-operative sensor.|$|E

5000|$|Engine vacuum is the {{difference}} between the pressures in the intake manifold and ambient atmospheric pressure. Engine vacuum is a [...] "gauge" [...] pressure, since gauges by nature measure a pressure difference, not an <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure.</b> The engine fundamentally responds to air mass, not vacuum, and <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> is necessary to calculate mass. The mass of air entering the engine is directly proportional to the air density, which is proportional to the <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> and inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.|$|R
50|$|Boyle's law {{states that}} at {{constant}} temperature for a fixed mass, the <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{the volume of}} a gas are inversely proportional. The law can also be stated {{in a slightly different}} manner, that the product of <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> and volume is always constant.|$|R
50|$|One {{approach}} used {{to mitigate the}} problem has been to reduce the boost pressure, which reduces the required venting volume and yields less charge over-calculation by the ECU. The air can also be recirculated back into the intake, a typical stock setup for cars with an upstream MAF sensor. The situation can also be corrected by switching the fuel metering system over to a <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor, a conversion that usually requires a compatible aftermarket ECU or piggy-back fuel controller. The MAP sensor monitors the absolute pressure in the manifold at all times and will correctly detect the change that occurs when the valve vents, allowing the ECU to reduce fuel metering accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure {{information to the}} engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data {{is used to calculate}} air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E
50|$|The {{carburettors}} were ditched {{in favour}} of a Bosch D-Jetronic, Bosch's first commercially produced electronic fuel injection system. Bosch D-Jetronic was a very early version of multi-point EFI, the “D” stood for “drucksensorgesteuert” (pressure sensor regulated). Unlike later Bosch fuel injection system, the injection was direct to the cylinder instead of via the Plenum inlets, which meant the a specific cylinder head was manufactured specifically for the engine, making this model unique and expensive to produce and purchase. Different from older mechanical injection systems, it incorporated taking input from the pressure inside the intake manifold. This {{is known as the}} Air Mass Sensor or in modern terms this would be known as the MAP-sensor (<b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure),</b> a part that’s commonly found in more modern vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Moderate vacuum {{pressure}} readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, {{as they may}} represent <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> or gauge pressure without a negative sign.

50|$|MAP sensors measure <b>absolute</b> <b>{{pressure}}.</b> Boost sensors or gauges {{measure the}} amount of pressure above a set <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure.</b> That set <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> is usually 100 kPa. This is {{commonly referred to as}} gauge pressure. Boost pressure is relative to <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> - as one increases or decreases, so does the other. It is a one-to-one relationship with an offset of -100 kPa for boost pressure. Thus a MaP sensor will always read 100 kPa more than a boost sensor measuring the same conditions. A MaP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> where zero is the total absence of pressure. Vacuum is measured as a negative pressure relative to normal atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-Boost sensors can display negative readings, indicating vacuum or suction (a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere). In forced induction engines (supercharged or turbocharged), a negative boost reading indicates that the engine is drawing air faster than it is being supplied, creating suction. The suction is caused by throttling in spark ignition engines and is not present in diesel engines. This is often called vacuum pressure when referring to internal combustion engines.|$|R
5000|$|Air was {{provided}} {{from the air}} filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), <b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure</b> (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|E
50|$|With OBD II standards, vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{were required to}} test the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve for functionality during driving. Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this. In these vehicles, they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor. The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve. The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (i.e., a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air) the powertrain control module (PCM) will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MaP sensor's values. If the EGR is functioning properly, the <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> will increase as exhaust gases enter.|$|E
5000|$|The Trionic T5.2 uses a Mecel {{patented}} ion-current measurement1 {{to decide}} which cylinder was in the compression phase and had just ignited the air/fuel mixture.

This ion-current measurement can also determine whether there had been detonation or knocking when the cylinder fired. Finally, the ion-current measurement {{can be used to}} identify a misfire with outstanding accuracy. [...] Trionic T5.2 uses a MAP (<b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure)</b> sensor to, indirectly, measure the weight of the air that has been drawn/forced into the cylinders.
