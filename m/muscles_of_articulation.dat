40|$|Subdural electrocorticographic (ECoG) {{recordings}} {{in patients}} undergoing epilepsy surgery {{have shown that}} functional activation is associated with event-related broadband gamma activity in a higher frequency range (> 70 Hz) than previously studied in human scalp EEG. To investigate the utility of this high gamma activity (HGA) for mapping language cortex, we compared its neuroanatomical distribution with functional maps derived from electrical cortical stimulation (ECS), which remains {{the gold standard for}} predicting functional impairment after surgery for epilepsy, tumours or vascular malformations. Thirteen patients had undergone subdural electrode implantation for the surgical management of intractable epilepsy. Subdural ECoG signals were recorded while each patient verbally named sequentially presented line drawings of objects, and estimates of event-related HGA (80 – 100 Hz) were made at each recording site. Routine clinical ECS mapping used a subset of the same naming stimuli at each cortical site. If ECS disrupted mouth-related motor function, i. e. if it affected the mouth, lips or tongue, naming could not be tested with ECS at the same cortical site. Because naming during ECoG involved these <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> the sensitivity and specificity of ECoG HGA were estimated relative to both ECS-induced impairments of naming and ECS disruption of mouth-related motor function. When these estimates were made separately for 12 electrode sites per patient (the average number with significant HGA), the specificity of ECoG HGA with respect to ECS was 78 % for naming and 81 % for mouthrelate...|$|E

40|$|A Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) is {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} to perform multimodal speech recognition using myoeletric signals (MES) from the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> vocal <b>articulation.</b> MES signals are immune to noise, and words that are acoustically similar manifest distinctly in MES. Hence, they would effectively complement the acoustic data in a multimodal speech recognition system. Research in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition has shown that CHMMs model the asynchrony between different data streams effectively. Hence, we propose CHMM for multimodal speech recognition using audio and MES as the two data streams. Our experiments indicate that the multimodal CHMM system significantly outperforms the audio only system at different SNRs. We have also provided a comparison between different features for MES and have found that wavelet features provide the best results. 1...|$|R

Speech recognition was performed, using five channels of myoelectric signals, on isolated words from a 10 word vocabulary. Temporal variance was induced by temporally misaligning data from the test set, with respect to the training set. When compared to the LDA classifier, the hidden Markov model classifier demonstrated a markedly lower variation in classification error due to the temporal misalignment. Characteristics of the hidden Markov model MES classifier suggest that it would effectively complement a conventional acoustic speech recognizer, in a multi-modal speech recognition system...|$|R

50|$|In {{linguistics}} (articulatory phonetics), articulation {{refers to}} how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to {{the manner in which}} the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> there may be several manners <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> and therefore several homorganic consonants.|$|R

The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis representing the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and the y-axis representing manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where the points intersect. The top radical represents manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> where the bottom represents place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> A horizontal line running through the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing.
