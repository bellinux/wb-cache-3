40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the historiography of nineteenth-century <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> in the Low Countries and sketches opportunities for new research. Three research traditions will be identified. The first two traditions correspond to the different reception of the concept of ‘professionalisation’ (the development of medicine into a modern profession) in the Netherlands and Belgium, which resulted in different interpretations of the professional function of <b>medical</b> <b>societies.</b> The third tradition comprises the research into the advisory function of these societies and their political lobby relating to public health. As each of these research traditions discussed <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> within their own interpretative framework, the historiographical image of nineteenth-century <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> has also become highly fragmented. While the efforts of <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> to build and protect their professional interests have been extensively studied, the scientific activities of these <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> have only received limited attention. This paper suggests that a more complete analysis can be achieved by considering <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> as research communities. From such a perspective, the scientific practices performed in <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> can be studied in close relation to their professional functioning, thus enabling new insights into the relation between scientific and professional developments in nineteenth-century medicine...|$|R

5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York <b>Medical</b> <b>Society</b> that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E

5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties <b>Medical</b> <b>Society.</b> The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

5|$|When his step-father, Alexander Breckinridge, died in 1801, he {{was able}} to return, but had to {{withdraw}} again due to a lung illness. He moved to Philadelphia and was placed under the care of Dr. Benjamin Rush, an experience that influenced his decision to pursue a medical career. After an apprenticeship in Louisville, Kentucky, Floyd enrolled in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1804 and became an honorary member of the Philadelphia <b>Medical</b> <b>Society</b> {{and a member of the}} Philadelphia Medical Lyceum. Floyd was graduated in 1806 and his graduating dissertation was entitled An Enquiry into the Medical Properties of the Magnolia Tripetala and Magnolia Acuminata. He moved to Lexington, Virginia and then to the town of Christiansburg, Virginia. Floyd also served as a Justice of the Peace in 1807.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric <b>Medical</b> <b>Society</b> that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
