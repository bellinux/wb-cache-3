5|$|Although {{a useful}} {{deterrent}} against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> {{the gates of}} Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, as suggested by Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1644, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians had been besieging York, which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle. Rupert had {{gathered}} an army which <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the northwest of England, gathering reinforcements and fresh recruits on the way, and across the Pennines to relieve the city. The convergence of these forces made the ensuing battle {{the largest of the}} civil wars.|$|E

The Sousa Band toured from 1892 to 1931, performing at 15,623 concerts both in America and around the world, including at the World Exposition in Paris, France and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In Paris, the Sousa Band <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the streets to the Arc de Triomphe– one of only eight parades the band marched in over its forty years.|$|E
5|$|In 359, Julian {{restored}} seven forts {{and town}} {{walls in the}} middle Rhine, including Bonna (Bonn) and Bingium (Bingen), obliging his new tributary Alamanni to provide the supplies and labour needed. He then crossed the Rhine, <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> {{the territory of the}} tributaries and devastated the lands of the other kings who had fought at Strasbourg, including Westralp. All were forced to submit and return the thousands of Roman civilians they had abducted and enslaved during the years of easy plunder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1189, German crusaders <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> Hungary {{under the command of}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Béla welcomed Frederick, and {{dispatched}} a troop to escort the crusaders across the Balkan Peninsula. At Frederick's request, Béla released his imprisoned brother, Géza, who joined the crusaders and left Hungary. Béla mediated a peace treaty between Frederick I and Isaac II, whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between the German crusaders and the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following the trail of the band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> pounding rain before they finally caught up with the Sauk.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 {{protest in}} Split was a street {{protest against the}} Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) held in Split, Croatia on 6 May 1991. The protest was {{organised}} by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard and joined in by workers from other companies {{in the city and}} other residents of Split after radio broadcast appeals for help while the protesters <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the streets. Ultimately, the protest drew 100,000 supporters.|$|E
5|$|Thence {{the fleet}} {{continued}} {{on to the}} Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe. The army then <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already {{been added to the}} Persian Empire in 512 BC, during Darius's campaign against the Scythians. Upon reaching Macedon, the Persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been vassals of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of 18 {{men of the}} 1st The Royal Dragoons, commanded by Captain Methuen, arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in the late afternoon. They <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the streets as a show of force, remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law, and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vivisectionists {{commissioned}} a bronze {{statue of the}} dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque—"Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?"—leading to frequent vandalism of the memorial {{and the need for}} a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, {{one of a series of}} battles known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E
5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E

5|$|At 01:30 on 7 June, the 9th Parachute Battalion, {{with only}} around ninety {{men at the}} time, <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the unoccupied Bréville. Upon arrival at the 3rd Parachute Brigade's position, the {{parachute}} battalion was ordered to dig in at {{the northern end of}} the brigade line. They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across a clearing in the woods, to a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts. A shortage in their numbers left a large gap between the 9th Parachute Battalion and No. 6 Commando, the most southern unit in the commando defensive position, to their north.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrators in Milwaukee protested peacefully against Trump and Senator Ron Johnson, and {{in support}} of {{immigration}} and women's rights. They marched from Zeidler Union Square to the Federal Building. Milwaukee Coalition Against Trump organized the demonstration; Citizen Action Organizing Cooperative was also represented. Mystic, Connecticut held a protest of around 60 demonstrators who <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> the downtown area. In Rapid City, South Dakota, hundreds of anti-Trump and Trump supporters turned out at a rally that began at noon. The groups stood opposite {{each other at the}} intersection of Omaha Street and Mount Rushmore Road, near Memorial Park. The event was organized by Joyce Patton.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War the Royalist Earl of Bath {{tried to}} raise troops in Cullompton but met {{resistance}} from local people. Troops passed through Cullompton on several occasions during the civil war: Sir Ralph Hopton rode with a small troop though the town {{on his way to}} Cornwall; Cornish Royalist forces <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> Cullompton on their way to join Prince Maurice at Chard as did The Earl of Essex and Thomas Fairfax. There were also troops on the streets of Cullompton again in 1655 during Penruddock's Uprising.|$|E

5|$|During {{the revolt}} many {{attempts}} were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist the revolt and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a coalition with the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued the revolt and <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. They crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out.|$|E

The Condor Legion officially returned to Germany on 6 June 1939 and troops <b>marched</b> <b>through</b> Berlin to the Lustgarten, where the fallen were honoured.
