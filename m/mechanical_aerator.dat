Out of the different configurations tested, the curved blade rotor (CBR) emerged as a potential aerator with blade tip angle of 47 °. The overall oxygen transfer co-efficient (KLa) was observed to be as high as 10. 33 h- 1 and the optimum aerator efficiency (AE) was found to be 2. 269 kgO 2 /kWh. The standard aeration efficiency (SAE) of CBR was observed to be higher as compared to other aerators used for oxidation ditch process. Dimensional analysis was used to develop equations that describe the aerator’s behavior. Further, a CFD model is also developed for better understanding of the process that takes place inside the ditch. To prepare it 3 D and steady flow, k-e turbulence model of flow was used and the simulation runs were carried out for one phase model to generate the data so as to compare it with experimentally observed values...|$|E

The rotor, which controls the aeration, is {{the main component of}} the aeration process. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} find out the variations in overall oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) and aeration efficiency (AE) for different configurations of aerator by varying the parameters viz. speed of aerator, depth of immersion, blade tip angles so as to yield higher values of KLa and AE. Six different configurations of aerator were developed and fabricated in the laboratory and were tested for abovementioned parameters. The curved blade rotor (CBR) emerged as a potential aerator with blade tip angle of 47 °. The mathematical models are developed for predicting the behaviour of CBR w. r. t kLa and power. In laboratory studies, the optimum value of KLa and AE were observed to be 10. 33 h- 1 and 2. 269 kg O 2 / kWh. ...|$|E

50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and <b>mechanical</b> <b>aerators</b> {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.|$|R

A purification process for raw melt has been developed using the same design of flotation unit as for raw syrup. This involves liming of the melt followed by a light carbonatation. The resultant precipitate is floated off and disposed of by returning to a syrup flotation clarifier in the raw house. The requirement for filters is reduced to a “check filtration” duty on clarified melt, eliminating the cost and complexity of the two-stage filtration and desweetening of carbonatation muds.

40|$|Intensification of {{agricultural}} practices {{has led to}} the production of liquid slurries in sufficient volumes that prohibits year round application. To reduce the risk of environmental pollution from inappropriate land applications, slurry is stored along with parlour and yard washings during the winter months, resulting in the accumulation of large volumea During storage, anaerobic conditions prevail, resulting in the breakdown of biological compounds into noxious and toxic chemicals which are of primary concern in environmental pollution. The introduction of large scale anaerobic digesters on every firm is impractical, as extensive supervision of the digester is required. The problems associated with the application of anaerobically stored shiny back to land, such as noxious odours, ground and surface water pollution and crop scorching are no longer tolerated by the general public and government pollution agencies. To alleviate some of the problems faced by farmers storing large quantities of slurry, aerobic treatment systems have been devised that can reduce the risk of pollution. Slurry aeration has become a widely used method in the treatment of cattle slurry, as it is effective in reducing odours, preventing crust formation and provides a semihomogenous mixture. The aeration system can vary dramatically in design and operation, from very simple bubble diffusers consisting of holes pierced into pipes which are laid across the floor of a tank, to complex Venturi systems which rely on the generation of negative pressures from tapered nozzles to draw air into a stream of slurry. The aeration systems used in this thesis are of a fine bubble difiliser and a <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>aerator</b> design. These systems were chosen because of their low capital and running costs. Aeration efficiency was studied at three scales, laboratory (up to 1 litre), intermediate (up to 80 litres) and pilot (up to 10, 000 litres) using volumetric mass transfer coefficient, standard oxygen transfer rate and oxygenation efficiency as the testing criteria. The fine bubble diffuser used throughout all the scale up experiments was of the same principle. Air was delivered through a compressor which was isolated outside of the reaction vessel. Sufficient air was delivered to the slurry at all scales to prevent the need for an additional mixing unit to maintain the solids in suspension. However, at pilot scale the design of the diffuser layout as critical in order to prevent biological fouling of the material. The <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>aerator</b> used at pilot scale was placed within the centre of the reaction vessel and could only be accessed by removing it from the tank. The mode of operation was to thaw liquid up through a central volumetric screw and release it radially outwards above the suthce of the liquid. The ability of the <b>mechanical</b> suthce <b>aerator</b> to transfer oxygen to both water and slurry was higher than that of the fine bubble difibser, with concomitant higher kLa, SOTK and OE being recorded. The introduction of oxygen into cattle slurry had two effects, the generation of a stable microbial culture and a major reduction in physical and chemical pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand, total solids and total suspended solids. Each aeration device generated a microbial population which was distinctive in gross morphology and settling characteristic& Both microbial populations flocculated naturally and quickly settled to a clear liquor and brown sludge. Flocs generated through violent aeration were small and compact, unlike the large feathery flocs generated by the fine bubble diffliser. The <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>aerator</b> achieved higher reductions in all the measured pollutants than the fine bubble difihiser, with reductions of 75...|$|R

The residues of the applied pesticides {{stay in the}} environment and therefore causing contamination of air, water and land. Moreover, agricultural industries are also contributing relatively high quantities of toxic pesticides into the environment. Since {{most of them have}} no treatment facilities. These pesticides may be toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic. They may be bioaccumulated or biomagnified by the biota. Therefore its removal from environmental systems needs special attention. In this study, bacterial isolate, Pseudomonas, designated as IES-Ps- 1, was used to assess its potential for pesticide removal from industrial wastewater using the biosimulator (activated sludge process). During experimental studies conducted in the flask as well as in biosimulator, it was observed that IES-Ps- 1 grows normally at low concentrations of added insecticides when compared with the control test (without pesticide). However, at high concentrations the microbial count decreased but no death occurred and the culture remained in lag phase. In many cases, the growth of organisms {{in the presence of the}} particular substrate serves as an indication about its metabolic potential. However, to confirm these results, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and HPLC analysis were performed.

The aeration devices we examined circulate and aerate all the water in the dugout at all depths shallower than the location of the air injector.

40|$|A {{consortium}} {{consisting of}} a Chlorella sorokiniana strain and a Ralstonia basilensis strain was {{able to carry out}} sodium salicylate biodegradation in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) using exclusively photosynthetic oxygenation. Salicylate biodegradation depended on algal activity, which itself was a function of microalgal concentration, light intensity, and temperature. Biomass recirculation improved the photobioreactor performance by up to 44 % but the results showed the existence of an optimal biomass concentration above which dark respiration started to occur and the process efficiency started to decline. The salicylate removal efficiency increased by a factor of 3 when illumination was increased from 50 - 300 muE/M- 2 (.) s. In addition, the removal rate of sodium salicylate was shown to be temperature-dependent, increasing from 14 to 27 mg/l(.) h when the temperature was raised from 26. 5 to 31. 5 degreesC. Under optimized conditions (300 muE/m(2) (.) s, 30 degreesC, 1 g sodium salicylate/l in the feed and biomass recirculation) sodium salicylate was removed at a maximum constant rate of 87 mg/l. h, corresponding to an estimated oxygenation capacity of 77 mg O- 2 /l(.) h (based on a BOD value of 0. 88 g O- 2 /g sodium salicylate for the tested bacterium), which is in the range of the oxygen transfer capacity of large-scale <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>aerators.</b> Thus, although higher degradation rates were attained in the control reactor, the photobioreactor is a cost-efficient process which reduces the cost of aeration and prevents volatilization problems associated with the degradation of toxic volatile organic compounds under aerobic conditions.

40|$|Water is a {{fundamental}} need for existence of mankind. Only 0. 01 % of total global water is readily available for human consumption as fresh water. The rapid increase in human population and consequent rise in urbanization and industrialization is producing a stress on this meager water resource. Water {{at the same time}} is a renewable resource, ie with suitable treatment it can be made re-useable. Aeration is one of the important processes employed in activated sludge process of the biological treatment units of wastewater. In this process the level of dissolved oxygen in the effluent is raised to the required amounts to decompose organic matters present in the effluent and thereby to reduce the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent by a physical means called “aeration process”. The aeration process consumes as much as 60 - 80 % of total power requirements of wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, the efficiency in design of aeration process is required so that treatment and its power consumption can be economized. With the objective of optimizing the aeration process the present work in this thesis endeavors to develop an aeration which is efficient as well as economical. The various geometric parameters that affect the aeration process in <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>aerators</b> have been optimized. In the present work circular surface aeration tanks have been used. There are two types of circular tanks: Baffled and unbaffled. Separate optimal geometric parameters have been obtained for baffled and unbaffled circular tanks. With optimal geometric similitude scale up studies were done. Reynolds number and Froude number criteria has been found unsuitable for scaling oxygen transfer rates. Theoretical power per unit volume parameter is the most suitable scaling parameter for oxygen transfer rates in both baffled and unbaffled circular tanks. Baffled circular tanks are found to give better performance in terms of oxygen transfer rates as compared to unbaffled tanks. In contrast unbaffled tanks give better performance in terms of power consumption as compared to baffled circular tanks. General correlations have been developed for oxygen transfer rates for both baffled and unbaffled circular surface aerations tanks which incorporate all the geometric and dynamic parameters. These correlations help in the design of new treatment facilities as well as evaluating and up gradation of existing facilities. Power consumption studies have also been conducted on circular surface aeration tanks. Geometric parameters affect the power consumption significantly. Using the optimal geometric similarity conditions obtained for oxygen transfer rates the scale up studies for power consumption has also been done. Reynolds and Froude criteria are found to be giving scale effects for non dimensional power consumption parameter, power number. Theoretical power per unit volume parameter is found to be the scaling parameters for power number and a suitable correlation equation has been developed for baffled circular surface aeration tanks. General correlations have been developed for power number in baffled and unbaffled circular tanks. A novel type of self aspirating tube sparger system has been developed. It is like a bubble aerator with a rotor. The various geometric parameters that affect oxygen transfer rates have been optimized in baffled circular surface aeration tank. The optimal geometrically similar tanks have been used for scale up studies. Theoretical power per unit volume parameter is found to be the scaling parameter for oxygen transfer rates in circular surface aeration tanks with self aspirating sparger systems. Circular baffled tanks with a special sparger system gives very much higher oxygen transfer rates (as much as 5. 7 times) as compared to circular tanks. The oxygen transfer rates data from literature also show lower values as compared to the system developed in this thesis. Geometrically similar unbaffled tanks have also been used with self aspirating sparger system. For same power consumption oxygen transfer rate in circular surface aeration tanks with self aspirating sparger system is higher as compared to circular tanks without self aspirating system. Mixing mechanisms in surface aeration tanks depend upon two different extreme length scales of time, namely macromixing and micromixing. Small scale mixing close to the molecular level is referred to as micromixing; whereas macromixing refers to the mixing on a large scale. The effect of geometrical parameters on macromixing time has been studied. The scaling parameters for macromixing and micromixing have been developed and simulation equations governing these time scales are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Docks are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} main weed problems of grassland. The absence of an effective non-chemical control may be a deterrent to organic-conversion for farmers accustomed to using herbicides for dock control. This work addresses this problem in the context of MAFF policy to encourage more farmers to adopt organic farming, and to encourage a reduction in the use of herbicides in farming generally. The project was based around hypotheses that physical techniques and management strategies can affect the relative competitiveness of docks within the grass-based sward, and that by exploiting this relative competitiveness the problem can be reduced or contained within acceptable limits. During the initial phase of the project (01 / 05 / 95 to 31 / 03 / 98) we investigated these hypotheses through a series of four linked experimental objectives. The results obtained during that period (i. e. the 1996 and 1997 seasons) were reported to MAFF in a CSG 13 in 1998. In the case of two of these experiments in particular, it was apparent that the observation and recording periods were too short to draw meaningful conclusions, and that the value of the overall project would be improved by an additional recording period. This CSG 13 updates the previous one and reports primarily on the results from these two experiments obtained during 1998 - 99 (the 1998 growing season). The outcomes of these two approaches (Objectives 2 and 3 on the original CSG 7) are summarized below. Objective 2 : Trials were carried out to determine the effects of using a <b>mechanical</b> soil <b>aerator</b> in spring, and its timing, on the subsequent development of docks in existing dock-infested areas of silage fields (action through stimulation of grass growth in spring through improved soil physical conditions, and/or potentially deleterious effect on docks by severing their rooting systems). The findings of this experiment during 1996 and 1997 were encouraging but showed the need for evaluations over a longer period than two years. The experiment was conducted in a situation where docks were increasing and dock ramet density increased on all treatments. The greatest increase occurred on the non-aerated control. The most significant effect resulted from the aeration treatment made in April (compared with June or April-plus-June). In the third year, 1998, there were no significant differences between the control and the three aeration treatments. Our overall conclusion from the three years of results with this technique on just one site is that it is a technique which offers some control of dock, but refining of the management guidelines and evaluation on a field scale on different soils are required. Objective 3 : Micro-plot trials using transplanted, spaced dock plants (to provide uniform density in swards) were used to investigate the effects of a wide range of options for controlling dock plants by cutting. Treatments included cutting at different intervals and to different residual sward heights. Assessments of results from 1996 had shown that the proportion of dock in the total herbage DM was lowest in treatments which were defoliated at regular 4 - 5 week intervals, and highest under less frequently defoliated regimes which simulated silage and hay regimes. These assessments were repeated in 1997 and the differences widened. However, total herbage DM yield was also higher on the ‘hay’ and ‘silage’ treatments, though differences were proportionately less than for the dock component. The micro-plot trial recorded in 1998 had been established from dock plug plants transplanted in 1996 and recorded in 1997. This method proved to be an effective one for establishment of experimental dock infestations of uniform density needed for investigations of this type, and one that would be practicable if required on a larger scale. The more frequently cut treatments had the lowest proportion of dock in the total herbage harvested, though this was in Year 2 only. This was a very similar result to that from the similar trial that had been recorded during 1996 and 1997. It seems likely that the effects resulting from cutting frequency may be cumulative, and at least two years of the frequent cutting may be required before dock plant size and vigor is reduced. The duration of these trials has not been long enough to determine whether long-term frequent cutting can eventually result in the elimination of dock plants. The effect of cutting height, which had no significant effects in either year of the experiment recorded in 1996 and 1997, was a significant factor affecting docks in the second year of this experiment. The low cutting height was favourable to docks. It seems likely that docks either respond to the lower cutting height by morphological adaptation, or that the lower sward height reduces the relative competitiveness of the other sward components. The results obtained from this suite of experiments (including the objectives completed before 1 April 1998) indicate that physical methods have a role in containing dock problems to an acceptable level, particularly in ensuring that flowering and seed dispersal does not occur. If resources were to be available for future work our recommendations would include the following: (1) The use of the soil mechanical treatment has been encouraging though further on-farm field-scale evaluations and refinement of management guidelines are needed before this can be recommended for general use by farmers. (2) As frequency of defoliation appears to be a factor affecting growth of docks and their total contribution to the sward, there is a need to establish whether docks can be eliminated, rather than being kept at a manageable level of infestation, and the management factors and timescale associated with this need to be determined. (3) The effects of increased seed rate and cover crop on limiting the development of seedling docks at establishment (shown in sward box studies in the 1996 - 97 phase of this research contract) needs to be evaluated at the field scale and on different soil types. ...|$|R
