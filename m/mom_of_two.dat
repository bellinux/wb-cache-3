5000|$|On the blog, Lenore {{proposed}} May 22, 2010 as {{the first}} Take Our Children to the Park & Leave Them There Day as a day for children {{to learn how to}} play by themselves without constant supervision. It has been celebrated every year since. Skenazy also became the host of the reality television show World's Worst Mom on Discovery Life. The 13-episode series features Skenazy visiting extremely anxious parents, including the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> a 10-year-old who still spoon-fed him, the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> an 8-year-old who bought him a skateboard but only let him [...] "ride" [...] it on the grass, and the <b>mom</b> <b>of</b> a 13-year-old who still took him into the ladies room. With humor, kindness, and some firmness, Skenazy separated the parents from their children and had the children do some tasks on their own, such as running an errand, or learning, at age 10, how to ride a bike. In the end, 12 of the 13 couples relaxed so much, that they became [...] "Free-Range Parents" [...] themselves. Now Skenazy lectures around the world, including speeches at Microsoft, Audi, The Yale Child Study Center, Wellesley, Barnard, and the Sydney Opera House.|$|R
