Findings revealed that teaching new <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> postpartum depression is related to a perinatal nurse's self-efficacy in postpartum-depression teaching, self-esteem, and the following self-efficacy-related variables: social persuasion (supervisor's expectations for teaching); mastery (postpartum depression continuing education and teaching experience); and vicarious experience (observing other nurses teach new <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> postpartum depression).

Second chapter describes risk factors of suppository uterine carcinoma and in third chapter I focus on Human papilloma virus. In fourth chapter I describe the suppository uterine carcinoma and in fifth chapter the disease diagnosis. Sixth chapter describes suppository uterine carcinoma treatment, seventh chapter contains the disease prognosis. Eighth chapter is dedicated to a preventive gynaecological examination and ninth chapter to the {{possibilities of}} the suppository uterine carcinoma prevention. The last chapter contains a description of a role of a midwife in the area of suppository uterine carcinoma prevention. The practical part is focused on a research of informedness of <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> possibilities of prevention.

40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} the development, implementation {{and evaluation of}} an educational intervention that addresses risky beliefs held by midwives and nurses working in maternity areas and new <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> therapeutic sun exposure. Procedure In 2002 – 2003, 59 midwives and nurses from a hospital in northern Queensland participated in an educational intervention to discourage mothers from exposing themselves and their infants to sunlight for therapeutic reasons. Intervention staff attended an educational workshop and/or received educational resources. Resources (posters, pamphlets and bookmarks) were developed for the staff to use for educating mothers. Process evaluation of the quality and usefulness of the workshop and resources was conducted immediately after the workshop and 12 months later. Findings Intervention staff indicated that the workshop was relevant to their work, and increased their knowledge and confidence in talking to <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> sunlight exposure. Ninety percent of the 59 participants indicated they had used the workshop information in their interactions with post-partum mothers. Of the resources, pamphlets and bookmarks were used most often. Conclusions and implications for practice The educational intervention was successful in developing the knowledge of midwives and nurses to provide sound advice to new <b>mothers</b> <b>about</b> therapeutic sun exposure and in developing resources to support them in their education. Although workshops and resources are useful in the short term, they are impractical to sustain. To improve sustainability, content on this topic needs to be incorporated into midwifery and nursing curricula across Australia. ...|$|R

25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of middle-aged men. However, the main philosophy seen across the story is the individualism, the stance which emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person's suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more about others than himself. This is because Subaru believes he can hurt others {{with the idea that}} he will never understand other people. The same problem comes from the fact Subaru and Hokuto are twins and as a result try to live in order to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual as his actions are deemed as arrogant by Seishiro for taking the guilt. Additionally, he starts taking actions that he believes are immoral despite his reasons for them such as lying to a <b>mother</b> <b>about</b> her daughter's wish to stop her from taking revenge.|$|E
