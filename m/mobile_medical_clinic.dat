40|$|Background In rural India, <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> {{are useful}} models for {{delivering}} health promotion, education, and care. <b>Mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> use fewer providers for larger catchment areas compared to traditional clinic models in resource limited settings, which is especially useful {{in areas with}} shortages of healthcare providers and a wide geographical distribution of patients. Methods From 2008 to 2011, we built infrastructure to implement a mobile clinic system to educate rural communities about maternal child health, train community health workers in common safe birthing procedures, and provide comprehensive antenatal care, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and testing for specific infections in a large rural catchment area of pregnant women in rural Mysore. This was done using two mobile clinics and one walk-in clinic. Women were tested for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, and bacterial vaginosis along with random blood sugar, urine albumin, and anemia. Sociodemographic information, medical, and obstetric history were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires in the local language, Kannada. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Stata SE 14. 1. Results During the program period, nearly 700 community workers and 100 health care providers were trained; educational sessions were delivered to over 15, 000 {{men and women and}} integrated antenatal care and HIV/sexually transmitted infection testing was offered to 3545 pregnant women. There were 22 (0. 6 %) cases of HIV, 19 (0. 5 %) cases of hepatitis B, 2 (0. 1 %) cases of syphilis, and 250 (7. 1 %) cases of BV, which were identified and treated. Additionally, 1755 (49. 5 %) cases of moderate to severe anemia and 154 (4. 3 %) cases of hypertension were identified and treated among the pregnant women tested. Conclusions Patient-centered <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> are feasible, successful, and acceptable models {{that can be used to}} provide quality healthcare to pregnant women in rural and hard-to-reach settings. The high numbers of pregnant women attending <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> show that integrated antenatal care with PMTCT services were acceptable and utilized. The program also developed and trained health professionals who continue to remain in those communities...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{recommendations}} for generation-based HCV and once lifetime HIV screening, thousands {{of individuals in}} the U. S. still remain untested and undiagnosed. This cross-sectional study examines the correlates of HCV and HIV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection in an urban Northeast setting. Utilizing an electronic database from a <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinic</b> in New Haven, CT from January 2003 to July 2011, 8, 311 individuals underwent structured health assessment and screening for HIV and HCV. HIV [N =  601 (8. 0 %) ] and HCV [N =  753 (10. 1 %) ] infection were identified, and 197 (26. 1 %) of the 753 with HCV were coinfected with HIV. Both monoinfection and coinfection status were independently correlated with crack cocaine use and increasing age. HIV/HCV coinfection was correlated with men having sex with men (MSM) (AOR =  38. 53, p< 0. 0080), shooting gallery use (AOR =  3. 06, p< 0. 0070), and not completing high school (AOR =  2. 51, p< 0. 0370). HCV monoinfection correlated with health insurance (AOR =  2. 16, p< 0. 0020), domestic violence (AOR =  1. 99, p< 0. 0070), and being Hispanic (AOR =  2. 63, p< 0. 0001), while HIV monoinfection correlated with having had syphilis (AOR =  2. 66, p< 0. 0001) and being Black (AOR =  1. 73, p =  0. 0010). Though HIV and HCV share common transmission risk behaviors, independent correlates with viral infection status in an urban Northeast setting are distinct and {{have important implications for}} surveillance, healthcare delivery, disease prevention, and clinical care...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this project was to gather {{epidemiological}} data on common diseases and medications dispensed during medical mission trips to Cambodia to shape the <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinic</b> formulary. Methods: Data for patients seen during week-long mobile medical clinics was collected in Cambodia during Septembers 2012 to 2014. Each patient’s gender, age, weight, blood pressure, glucose, pertinent laboratory values, diagnoses, and medications dispensed were collected. Blood pressure and glucose levels were measured in patients 18 years and above. Data collected onto paper intake forms were transferred onto spreadsheets without patient identifying information and analyzed for aggregate means, common diseases, and most dispensed medications. This project received institutional review board approval. Results: A total of 1, 015 patients were seen over three years. Women made up 61. 4 %, and the mean age was 41. 8 years. The most common diagnosis was gastrointestinal disorders (22. 9 %) that included gastroesophageal reflux disease and intestinal parasites. Next, 20. 1 % of patients had hypertension (BP> 140 / 90), 18. 0 % had presbyopia, 15. 4 % had back and joint pain, followed by 8. 8 % with headache, including migraines. Approximately 8. 4 % of patients had hyperglycemia (RPG > 140 mg/dl). The top five medications dispensed were acetaminophen, omeprazole, multivitamin, ibuprofen, and metformin. For hypertension, amlodipine and lisinopril were dispensed. Conclusion: Cambodia lacks systematic public health collection of epidemiological data for prevalence of diseases. Hence, investigators collected and analyzed information from week-long mobile medical clinics over three years. Proton-pump inhibitors and H. pylori lab tests were recommended for gastrointestinal disorders. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were recommended for pain. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were recommended over diuretics since patients were already dehydrated. Metformin was recommended for diabetes. Vitamins and supplements were recommended for malnourished patients. Hemoglobin machines and urine test strips were suggested. This information should help future teams decide what medications and laboratory tests {{would be the most}} beneficial for use by medical teams in Cambodia...|$|E
50|$|The {{charitable}} organization Hands Of Hope For the Children {{was formed}} upon {{the return of}} two teachers who had traveled on a bus, which acted as a mobile dentist clinic, through Guatemala in 1999.

5000|$|An {{extensive}} purge of {{the army}} {{was carried out in}} January 1914 with about 1,100 officers including 2 field marshals, 3 generals, 30 lieutenant-generals, 95 major-generals and 184 colonels whom Enver had considered to be inept or disloyal forced to take early retirement. Right {{from the time of the}} 1913 coup d’état, the new government planned to wage a total war, and wished to indoctrinate the entire Turkish population, especially the young people, for it. In June 1913, the government founded the Turkish Strength Association, a paramilitary group run by former army officers which all young Turkish men were encouraged to join. The Turkish Strength Association featured much physical exercise and military training intended to let the Turks become the [...] "warlike nation in arms" [...] and ensure that the current generation of teenagers [...] "who, in order to save the deteriorating Turkish race from extinction, would learn to be self-sufficient and ready to die for fatherland, honour and pride". Besides for engaging in gymnastics, long-distance walking, running, boxing, tennis, football jumping, swimming, horse-riding, and shooting practice, the Turkish Strength Association handed out free medical books, opened dispensaries to treat diseases like tuberculosis and ran free <b>mobile</b> <b>medical</b> <b>clinics.</b> The chief ideologue of the CUP, Ziya Gökalp wrote the anthem of the Turkish Strength Association, Yeni Atilla, ("New Atilla"). In May 1914, the Turkish Strength Association was replaced with the Ottoman Strength Clubs, which were very similar except for the fact that the Ottoman Strength Clubs were run by the Ministry of War and membership was compulsory for Turkish males between the ages of 10-17. Even more so than the Turkish Strength Association, the Ottoman Strength Clubs were meant to train the nation for war with an ultra-nationalist propaganda and military training featuring live-fire exercises being an integral part of its activities. In the aftermath of the First Balkan War, a much greater emphasis was put on Turkish nationalism with the Turks being glorified in endless poems, pamphlets, newspaper articles and speeches as a great warrior nation who needed to recapture their former glory. Along the same lines was a new emphasis on the role of women, who had the duty of bearing and raising the new generation of soldiers, who had to raise their sons to have [...] "bodies of iron and nerves of steel". Reflecting Goltz’s influence, especially his [...] "nation in arms" [...] theory, the purpose of the society under the new regime was to support the military.|$|R
