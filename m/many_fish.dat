5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). <b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E

5|$|Female Murray cod, upon first {{reaching}} sexual maturity, have egg {{counts of}} no more than 10,000. Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> have eyespots {{near their}} tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> species used Aliso Creek, {{the only}} remaining one is carp, which is known to survive in areas with high toxicity. Bird life was also abundant in the watershed—and 137species remain in the less developed areas of the watershed. Some of these birds include California least tern, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, California gnatcatcher, and western snowy plover. Remaining habitat for native wildlife is now primarily along Wood Canyon Creek, in {{the upper reaches of}} Aliso Creek, and along some parts of English Canyon.|$|E

5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. <b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in <b>many</b> <b>fish,</b> processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by <b>many</b> <b>fish.</b> The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> {{are covered}} with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. <b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like <b>many</b> <b>fish,</b> teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as <b>many</b> <b>fish</b> as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. <b>Many</b> <b>fish</b> also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E

While the first tower was rudimentary at best, its usefulness was quickly noted.|$|R
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in <b>many</b> <b>fish.</b> The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
