[...] "The blinding snow and bitter cold are nothing to her, I believe; yet she is but a 'chitty-faced creature,' as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> I could find in my heart to wish I had a cloak to wrap her in." ...|$|E

5000|$|The reason Wang is {{on stage}} is his mother. He said: [...] "My <b>mother</b> is like <b>my</b> girlfriend. We are very close. I'm still {{standing}} on stage {{today because of}} the pride I see on her face. I relish it. I fell wayward for 10 years, and she took care of me all those 10 years. I told myself I would never break her heart again because, no matter what I'd done wrong in the past, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> still <b>say,</b> 'you are still my son.'" ...|$|R
60|$|He laughed again, and so offensively that I clapped {{my hand to}} my sword. But before I {{could tell}} him what I thought of his stupidity and rudeness he had wheeled his horse, and was lumbering away down the other road. I saw his big fur cap vanish over the brow of the hill, and then I rode upon my way, {{wondering}} at his conduct. From time to time I put my hand to the breast of my tunic and felt the paper crackle beneath my fingers. Ah, my precious paper, which should be turned into the little silver medal for which I had yearned so long. All the way from Braine to Sermoise I was thinking of what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> when she saw it.|$|E
60|$|At {{the base}} of the mill there stood a shed which was evidently used to stall the horses which brought the farmers' grain. Some grass was heaped up inside it, so I {{loosened}} Covenant's girths and left him to have a hearty meal. The mill itself appeared to be silent and empty. I climbed the steep wood ladder, and pushing the door open, walked into a round stone-flagged room, from which a second ladder led to the loft above. On one side of this chamber was a long wooden box, and all round the walls were ranged rows of sacks full of flour. In the fireplace stood a pile of faggots ready for lighting, so with the aid of my tinder-box I soon had a cheerful blaze. Taking a large handful of flour from the nearest bag I moistened it with water from a pitcher, and having rolled it out into a flat cake, proceeded to bake it, smiling the while to think of what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to such rough cookery. Very sure I am that Patrick Lamb himself, whose book, the 'Complete Court Cook,' was ever in the dear soul's left hand while she stirred and basted with her right, could not have turned out a dish which was more to my taste at the moment, for I had not even patience to wait for the browning of it, but snapped it up and devoured it half hot. I then rolled a second one, and having placed it before the fire, and drawn my pipe from my pocket, I set myself to smoke, waiting with all the philosophy which I could muster until it should be ready.|$|E

5000|$|Florence Violet McKenzie {{was born}} Florence Violet Granville on 28 September 1890 in Melbourne, {{although}} before {{her marriage to}} Cecil McKenzie {{at the age of}} 34, she was known as Violet Wallace. Other sources cite 1892 as her birth year. Wallace was her stepfather George's surname; he was a commercial traveller. When Violet was an infant, the family moved to Austinmer, south of Sydney. [...] "I went down to Technical College and saw the Head there, and he said, 'Oh, you can't come here and do engineering unless you're working at it'… I said, 'Well now, suppose I had an electrical engineering business and I'm working at it, would that be all right?' He said, 'Yes, if you produce proof.' So I went back and I had some cards printed with my name on, and electrical work, and got the paper and wrote down the ads, and read that a house in ... Undercliffeabout 2 miles from the tram ... was asking for prices for putting in electric light and power… I went out there and nobody else was silly enough to go, so they gave me the job. … I went back to Tech and took my card down and showed them the contract for the job, and they said, 'All right, you can start.'" [...] Florence McKenzie From a young age, Violet had an independent interest in electricity and invention. As she recalled in an oral history interview in 1979:I used to play about with bells and buzzers and things around the house. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> sometimes <b>say</b> [...] "Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" [...] - she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.|$|R

5000|$|Cohen's {{life was}} full of events and people that {{motivated}} her to fight for women's right to vote. Firstly, her mother Jane was a big influential factor in Cohen's life. Because {{her mother was a}} widowed seamstress who raised three children alone, it was obvious to Cohen that her mother had few rights as a woman living in Britain in the late nineteenth century. Later in life at an interview, Cohen stated that, [...] "Life was hard. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> 'Leonora, if only we women had a say in things', but we hadn't. A drunken lout of a man...had a vote simply because he was a male. I vowed I'd try to change things." [...] Cohen recognised at a young age that her mother had to overcome huge obstacles in her life simply because she was a woman. It was [...] "her mother's lack of empowerment that radicalized her." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dancing was not {{a career}} {{acceptable}} to a conventional English family at that time. Ashton later recalled, [...] "My father was horrified. You can imagine the middle-class attitude. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'He wants {{to go on the}} stage.' She could not bring herself to say 'into the ballet.'" [...] Ashton's father sent him to England in 1919 to Dover College, where he was miserable. Homosexual, and with a distinctly Spanish accent that his classmates laughed at, he did not fit in at a minor public school of the early 1920s. He {{was not a}}cademically inclined, and his father decided that on leaving the school in 1921 Ashton should join a commercial company. He worked for an import-export firm in the City of London, where his ability to speak Spanish and French as well as English was an advantage. In January 1924 George Ashton committed suicide. His widow was left financially dependent on her elder sons, who ran a successful business in Guayaquil. She moved to London to be with Ashton and his younger sister, Edith.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, when Gahan was 10 years old, his {{stepfather}} died. Gahan recalled how he [...] "came {{home one day}} and found this bloke biological father at home". Of the incident, he has said: [...] "I'll never forget that day. When I came home from school, there was this stranger in my mum's house. My mother introduced him to me as my real dad. I remember I said, that was impossible because my father was dead. How was I supposed to know who that man was? From that day on, Len often visited the house, until one year later he disappeared again. Forever this time. Since then he had no contact with us. By growing older, I thought about him more and more. The only thing <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> was that he moved out to Jersey to open a hotel." [...] "Mum had kept it back from me 'til {{there was a need}} to tell me about my birth father, it's a different generation and you can understand I guess she thought she was doing the right thing." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{wanted to}} tell the truth but my parents were {{homophobic}} and I was in the closet. As well as that, I had people tell me that if I talked about what I was going through, it {{would be the end of}} the women's tour. I couldn't get a closet deep enough. One of my big goals was always to be honest with my parents and I couldn't be for a long time. I tried to bring up the subject but felt I couldn't. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "We're not talking about things like that", and I was pretty easily stopped because I was reluctant anyway. I ended up with an eating disorder that came from trying to numb myself from my feelings. I needed to surrender far sooner than I did. At the age of 51, I was finally able to talk about it properly with my parents and no longer did I have to measure my words with them. That was a turning point for me as it meant I didn't have regrets any more.|$|E
40|$|CluncksSaboos, oglibogs, cluncks, God walkers are terms used to {{describe}} a pair of boots (shoes, rubbers, sneakers, etc.) which look rather odd on the person's feet, usually by being too big for him. Sometimes, as a boy, I used to enjoy scuffing my father's boots around the house.
