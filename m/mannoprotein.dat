50|$|About 35-50% {{of humans}} possess C. albicans {{as part of}} their normal oral microbiota. With more {{sensitive}} detection techniques, this figure is reported to rise to 90%. This candidal carrier state is not considered a disease, since there are no lesions or symptoms of any kind. Oral carriage of Candida is pre-requisite for the development of oral candidiasis. For Candida species to colonize and survive as a normal component of the oral microbiota, the organisms must be capable of adhering to the epithelial surface of the mucous membrane lining the mouth. This adhesion involves adhesins (e.g., hyphal wall protein 1), and extracellular polymeric materials (e.g., <b>mannoprotein).</b> Therefore, strains of Candida with more adhesion capability have more pathogenic potential than other strains. The prevalence of Candida carriage varies with geographic location, and many other factors. Higher carriage is reported during the summer months, in females, in hospitalized individuals, in persons with blood group O and in non-secretors of blood group antigens in saliva. Increased rates of Candida carriage are also found in people who eat a diet high in carbohydrates, people who wear dentures, people with xerostomia (dry mouth), in people taking broad spectrum antibiotics, smokers, and in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., due to HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, Down syndrome or malnutrition). Age also influences oral carriage, with the lowest levels occurring in newborns, increasing dramatically in infants, and then decreasing again in adults. Investigations have quantified oral carriage of Candida albicans at 300-500 colony forming units in healthy persons. More Candida is detected in the early morning and the late afternoon. The greatest quantity of Candida species are harbored on the posterior dorsal tongue, followed by the palatal and the buccal mucosae. Mucosa covered by an oral appliance such as a denture harbors significantly more candida species than uncovered mucosa.|$|E

40|$|Cell wall <b>mannoproteins</b> {{released}} by Saccharomyces cerevisiae during wine fermentation and aging have recently {{attracted the attention}} of enologists and researchers in enology due to their positive effect over a number of technological and quality properties of the wines, including protein and tartaric stability, aroma and color stability, astringency, mouthfeel, malolactic fermentation, or foam properties of sparkling wines.

Bleomycin treatment also altered anchorage of <b>mannoproteins</b> to the cell wall matrix in intact cells or isolated cell walls. Cell surface <b>mannoproteins</b> were labelled with 125 I, and their solubilization was monitored. Seventeen hour treatments with bleomycin released some of the label directly into treatment supernatants and facilitated extraction of <b>mannoproteins</b> by dithiothreitol and lytic enzymes. Bleomycin treatments as short as 10 min caused changes in extraction of <b>mannoproteins</b> from intact cells. Specifically, cell wall anchorage of several <b>mannoproteins</b> was affected by the drug.

The similarity of results obtained in the presence and absence of cycloheximide, the appearance of cell wall effects after only 10 min of treatment, and the similarity of effects in intact cells and isolated cell walls are consistent with direct drug-induced damage and inconsistent with a mechanism dependent on expression of bleomycin-damaged genes or other intracellular mediators.

40|$|Yeast <b>mannoproteins</b> {{released}} {{during the}} process of aging wine on the yeast lees have been reported to make important contributions to wine quality. However, few <b>mannoproteins</b> have been identified in wine and their lifespan during aging is unknown.

40|$|Abstract Background Mannoproteins are yeast {{cell wall}} componend, and rich in mannose. The use of foods rich in mannose as carbohydrate, could have a bioprotective effect against entrobacteria {{intestinal}} infection. Nothing is known about mannoproteins' activity in inflammatory bowel processes induced by entrobacteria. This study investigates the effects of <b>mannoprotein</b> administration via a liquid diet on inflammatory response and TLR 5 expression during intestinal tissue injury in a rat model of infection with Salmonella typhimurium. Methods Adult Wistar male rats were divided into three groups: control, and <b>mannoprotein</b> E 1 at 10 or 15 %. Animals were fed with a liquid diet supplemented or not with <b>mannoprotein</b> E 1. Groups were infected by intragastrical administration of S. typhimurium. 24 h post-inoculation samples of spleen, ileum and liver were collected for microbiological studies. Gut samples were processed to determine levels of proinflammatory cytokines (mRNA) and TLR 5 (mRNA and protein) by quantitative PCR and Western-blot, {{and the number of}} proliferative and apoptotic cells determined by immunohistochemistry. Results Ininfected levels of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR 5 were higher in untreated controls than in the animals receiving <b>mannoprotein.</b> Proliferation was similar in both groups, whereas apoptosis was higher in controls. Curiosly, the <b>mannoprotein</b> effect was dose dependent. Conclusions <b>Mannoprotein</b> administration in a liquid diet seems to protect intestinal tissue against S. typhimurium infection. This protection seems to expressed as a lower pro-inflammatory response and TLR 5 downregulation in gut epithelium, as well as by an inhibition of apoptosis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which <b>mannoprotein</b> is able to regulate these responses remain unclear. These results could open up new avenues in the use of mannoproteins as prebiotics in the therapeutic strategy for treatment of inflammatory gut processes induced by microbia. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mannoproteins {{released}} by yeast cells throughout the winemaking process contribute {{in several ways}} to improve wine quality. For this reason, some winemaking practices have been developed {{in order to increase}} the <b>mannoprotein</b> content of wine. However, monitoring of <b>mannoprotein</b> content of wine during these processes, or even <b>mannoprotein</b> quantification in the final wines, is an analytical problem not easily solved so far. Here, we report a simple and accurate method for <b>mannoprotein</b> quantification in wines. The method involves isolation of wine polysaccharides by size exclusion chromatography, acid hydrolysis, elimination of acid by weak anionic exchange solid phase extraction, and analysis of monosaccharides by ion exclusion HPLC. Advantages over previously existing methods include low sample volumes, possibility of parallel processing for multiple samples, absence of precipitation steps, and clear distinction between mannoproteins and other wine polysaccharides. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A <b>mannoprotein</b> designated HPF 2 was purified from one of the fractions by gel permeation chromatography, and had a high capacity to reduce heat-induced protein haze formation in white wine. After electrophoretic separation and transfer to nitrocellulose, HPF 2 stained positively with an antibody (anti-HPFl) which had been raised against a previously isolated <b>mannoprotein</b> with known haze protective activity designated HPFL. Analysis of the carbohydrate portion of HPF 2 using methylation analysis confirmed the presence of (1 -> 2), (1 -> 3) and (1 -> 2, 1 -> 6) mannosyl residues and showed that it contained N-linked and possibly O-linked carbohydrate. Digestion of the <b>mannoprotein</b> with PNGase F resulted in a reduction in molecular weight, as measured by SDS-PAOE and confirmed the presence of N-linked carbohydrate. N-linked deglycosylation decreased the ability of HPF 2 to protect wine from heatinduced protein haze. Protein sequence analysis of the peptides derived from the HPF 2 <b>mannoprotein</b> obtained via digestion with endoproteinase Lys C led to the identification of the HPF 2 structural gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by searching the Yeast Proteome Database for related sequences. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of HPF 2 from its structural gene indicated that HPF 2 possessed a secretion signal at the NH₂-terminus, a putative OPI anchor site at the COOH-terminus and also contained serine and threonine rich regions at both the NH₂-terminus and COOHterminus. These regions may contain O-linked carbohydrate. There were also 15 potential glycosylation sites, five of which were classified from the peptide mapping data as likely glycosylation sites.

In the present study, the cryptococcal antigen, MP 88, that stimulated a second T-cell hybridoma, X 5 A 3, to secrete interleukin- 2 was characterized. MP 88 was purified from supernatants of glass bead-disrupted C. neoformans by anion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. A single band with an apparent molecular mass of 88 kDa was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to partial internal amino acid sequencing.

The glycosylated nature of these proteins was demonstrated by their reactivity with concanavalin A and by selective labeling with the biotin-hydrazide reagent following periodate oxidation. Differences in the oligosaccharides of these proteins were observed in regard to their reactivity with lectin-peroxidase reagents and sensitivity to glycosidases such as N-glycanase or endoglycosidase F (but not endoglycosidase H). The 60 -kDa <b>mannoprotein</b> reacted with wheat germ agglutinin, while the 50 -kDa <b>mannoprotein</b> did not. Treatment of the 60 -kDa <b>mannoprotein</b> with the glycosidases mentioned above resulted in its conversion into a species of 40 to 45 kDa. Enzyme treatment had no obvious effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the 50 -kDa species from blastoconidia.

Treatment of intact cells with low concentrations of beta-glucanase (Zymolyase 20 T) or proteases abolished or significantly reduced attachment of latex beads to hyphae. This effect paralleled an obvious reduction in CSH of the entire cell population, as measured by an aqueous-hydrocarbon biphasic partitioning assay. Analysis of the cell wall material released by Zymolyase and adsorbed on polystyrene microspheres indicated that germ tube-specific cell wall proteins and <b>mannoproteins</b> with apparent molecular masses of 20 to 67 kDa may be responsible for the hydrophobicity of hyphae. Zymolyase released from blastoconidia cell walls a different set of proteins and <b>mannoproteins</b> that were able to adsorb to polystyrene microbeads. Such molecular species might in turn be responsible for the CSH exhibited by blastoconidium populations as determined by the biphasic partitioning assay, although these probably hydrophobic components can be masked on the surface of blastoconidia, as the latter had no or very few latex microspheres attached to their surfaces.

(1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561 - 1570) characterized a mutant, mnn 2 - 2, which lacked terminal N-acetylglucosamine in its <b>mannoproteins.</b> The mutant had normal levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, and the partially purified enzyme from wild-type and mutant cells had the same apparent size, heat stability, affinity for substrates, metal requirement, and subcellular location. No qualitative or quantitative differences were found between mutant and wild-type cells in endogenous mannan acceptors and pools of UDP-GlcNAc. Chitin was synthesized at similar rates in wild-type and mutant cells, and the latter did not have a soluble inhibitor of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase or a hexosaminidase that could remove N-acetylglucosamine from <b>mannoproteins.</b> Together, the above observations led Douglas and Ballou ((1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561 - 1570) to postulate that the mutant might have a defect in compartmentation of substrates involved in the biosynthesis of <b>mannoproteins.</b> We determined whether the above mutant phenotype is the result of defective transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from K. lactis. Golgi vesicles which were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo were isolated from wild-type and mnn 2 - 2 mutant cells and incubated with UDP-GlcNAc in an assay in vitro. The initial rate of transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from wild-type cells was temperature dependent, saturable with an apparent Km of 5. 5 microM and a Vmax of 8. 2 pmol/mg of protein/ 3 min. No transport of UDP-GlcNAc was detected into Golgi vesicles from mutant cells. However, Golgi vesicles from both cells translocated GDP-mannose at comparable velocities, indicating that the above transport defect is specific. In addition to the above defect in <b>mannoproteins,</b> mutant cells were also deficient in the biosynthesis of glucosamine containing lipids...|$|R

O. “Vinos de Madrid” were studied. Both fractions from different white wines {{were separated by}} high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography. Glycosyl composition and linkages of wine polysaccharides were determined by GC-EI-MS chromatography. Molar-mass distributions were determined by SEC-MALLS and intrinsic viscosity by differential viscometer. Yeast species and type of inoculation {{have a significant impact}} on wine carbohydrate composition and structure. Mannose residues from <b>mannoproteins</b> were significantly predominant in those cultures where T. delbrueckii was present in the fermentation process in comparison with pure culture of S. cerevisiae, whereas galactose residues from Polysaccharides Rich in Arabinose and Galactose presented higher values in pure culture of S. cerevisiae, indicating that S. cerevisiae released less <b>mannoproteins</b> than T. delbrueckii. Moreover, we reported structural differences between <b>mannoproteins</b> released by T. delbrueckii CLI 918 and those released by S. cerevisiae CLI 889. These findings help to provide important information about the polysaccharides and oligosaccharides released from cell wall of Malvar grapes and the carbohydrates released from each yeast species...|$|R
40|$|Many mannoprotein-based {{products}} and overproducing yeast {{are available for}} enological use, but few scientific studies have reported their use and effects on red wine composition. The effect of a selected <b>mannoprotein</b> overproducing yeast strain on Tempranillo winemaking was studied {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by adding commercial mannoprotein-rich preparations in the prefermentative stage. Wines were prepared using traditional wine technology. Polysaccharides were extracted, fractionated by high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography, and quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection after acidic methanolysis and derivatization. Polyphenols were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography, monomeric phenolics were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-ray detector, and proanthocyanidins by the vanillin assay. Color was measured by spectrophotometric methods. The use of <b>mannoprotein</b> overproducing yeast strains strongly increased high-molecular-weight <b>mannoprotein</b> content during the maceration. No differences were observed in terms of grape polysaccharides, monomeric phenolics, or color parameters, but proanthocyanidin content was significantly reduced when using the overproducing strain. Except for wine color, mannoproteins released from yeast strains produced the same effects as commercial mannoproteins. Winemakers could use both alternatives to reduce red wine astringency and increase wine smoothness and body, although commercial mannoproteins may cause loss of red wine stable color.

40|$|A {{beta-glucanase}} (Z-glucanase) from Zymolyase {{was freed}} from a protease (Z-protease) by affinity chromatography on alpha 2 -macroglobulin-Sepharose columns {{and used to}} solubilize proteins from isolated cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cell wall proteins were labeled with 125 I and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The bulk of the labeled material had very low mobility. Its <b>mannoprotein</b> nature was demonstrated by precipitation with specific antibodies and by conversion to a band with an average molecular weight of 94, 000 after incubation with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The intact mannoproteins were hydrolyzed by Z-protease, but were resistant to the enzyme when the carbohydrate was first removed by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. In intact cells, lysis of cell walls by Z-glucanase required a previous incubation with z-protease, which led to solubilization {{of most of the}} 125 I-labeled proteins. Other proteases that did not attack the cell wall mannoproteins were unable to substitute for Z-protease. The specific effect of Z-protease is consistent with the notion that mannoproteins form a surface layer of the cell wall that penetrates the wall to some depth and shields glucans from attack by Z-glucanase. Mannoproteins, however, do not appear to cover the inner face of the cell wall, because isolated cell walls, in contrast to intact cells, were completely solubilized by Z-glucanase in the absence of protease. The function of mannoproteins in determining cell wall porosity was highlighted by the finding that horseradish peroxidase (Mr, 40, 000) causes lysis of cells that had been treated with Z-protease. Depletion of mannoproteins by Z-protease also resulted in the disappearance of a darkly stained surface layer of the cell wall, as observed by electron microscopy. Other agents that facilitate cell lysis by Z-glucanase, such as 2 -mercaptoethanol, digitonin, and high concentrations of salts, caused little or no solubilization of <b>mannoprotein.</b> We assume that they perturb and loosen the structure of the <b>mannoprotein</b> network, thereby increasing its porosity. The implications of our results for the construction of the yeast cell wall and the anchoring of <b>mannoprotein</b> to the cell are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The total {{cell wall}} <b>mannoprotein</b> has been {{isolated}} from a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that fails to}} remove the glucose units of the dolichol-linked precursor after transfer of the oligosaccharide to asparagine units in the protein. The oligosaccharides released from this <b>mannoprotein</b> by endoglucosaminidase H digestion show 1 H NMR signals assignable to three alpha-linked glucose units as delta 5. 52, 5. 27, and 5. 17, and a comparison with the chemical shifts of reference compounds shows that these signals {{are consistent with the}} structure alpha Glc [...] 2 alpha Glc [...] 3 alpha Man [...] 2. This provides a direct confirmation for the structure previously assigned to the lipid-linked precursor.

40|$|In this study, a {{recombinant}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EKD 13 overproducing <b>mannoproteins</b> {{has been}} used to obtain Albariño white wines. The inoculated strain prevailed and produced complete fermentation of the must, as also occurred in the case of spontaneous (non-inoculated) fermentation and in the must inoculated with the S. cerevisiae EC 1118 strain. The analytical study of the wines obtained showed that the most important chemical differences among the wines produced with EKD- 13, corresponded to the high concentration of <b>mannoproteins,</b> 2 -phenyl ethanol and tyrosol. These differences were attributed to the expression, during must fermentation, of genes modified in the recombinant EKD- 13 strain. The results obtained imply that this strain could be potentially useful to produce wines rich in <b>mannoproteins</b> that have distinctive characteristics compared to other similar wines, modifying the sensorial and technological parameters of the wines obtained. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Representing around 40 % of {{the cell}} wall dry weight, <b>mannoproteins</b> are complex macromolecules {{structurally}} composed of polymers of sugar, 98 % being mannose, covalently linked to peptides. Along the last two decades, these compounds have gained ground as very relevant molecules {{in the field of}} winemaking, mainly due to their positive contributions in the development of appreciated organoleptic features and to their contribution in the chemical stabilization of wine. Several methodologies have been recently proposed to achieve the quantification of these compounds. However, these methodologies are laborious, time consuming and do not allow a global quantification of these macromolecules. In this paper, an easy, reliable and fast forward methodology for the quantification of <b>mannoproteins</b> in model must is proposed and evaluated. Its application in the quantification of <b>mannoproteins</b> content in yeast cell wall is also demonstrated.
