40|$|Structural {{relationships}} {{and the effects}} of isomorphous substitution lead to a new interpre-tation of the phenomenon of metamictization for these minerals. It is proposed that many possible structures exist with about the same stability, each being favored by slight composi-tional differences. The <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> is thus seen as the result of segregation into domains or microregions of different structure and/or composition. fntroduction We believe, following Pyatenko (1970), that the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> in the niobium tantalum oxide min-erals is due not to radiation damage, but to their complex chemical compositions, In discussing this thesis we will define the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> as,,a state of lattice disorder and imperfection in externally well-crystallized natural minerals, which may be an-nealed out by moderate heating, " leaving open the mebns by which this state is induced.

40|$|The {{course of}} {{radiation}} induced damage produced in α-quartz by neutrons, ions, electrons or photons — {{commonly known as}} metamictization — has been re-analyzed by careful comparison of available experimental data. Specific interest was devoted to confront experimental <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> features with current structural models. It comes out that the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> of irradiated quartz should exhibit some structural characteristics of the modulated structure proposed for vitreous silica. The metamictization process {{is consistent with a}} structural relaxation process of a highly defective quartz matrix. According to this new point defect analysis, structural relaxation should be triggered by a critical concentration of oxygen vacancy point defects likely to significantly lower the connectivity of the SiO 2 network. Various experimental results are interpreted by incorporating the influence of the SiO 2 crystalline polymorph and the influence {{of the nature of the}} irradiating particle to the point defect model...|$|E

40|$|In ceramic industry, {{zircon sand}} {{is widely used}} in {{different}} applications because zirconia plays a role as common opacifying constituent. In particular, it {{is used as a}} basic component of glazes applied to ceramic tiles and sanitary ware as well as an opacifier in unglazed bulk porcelain stoneware. Natural zircon sands are the major source of zirconium minerals for industrial applications. In this paper, long, medium, and short range studies were conducted on zirconium minerals originated from Australia, South Africa, and United States of America using conventional and less conventional techniques (i. e., X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS), and Perturbed Angular Correlations (PAC)) in order to reveal the type and the extension of the regions that constitute the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> of zircon sands and the modifications therein produced {{as a consequence of the}} industrial milling process and the thermal treatment in the production line. Additionally, HPGe gamma-ray spectroscopy confirms the occurrence of significant levels of natural radioactivity responsible for metamictization in the investigated zircon samples.

Radiation damage can produce diverse results, but most commonly, crystalline periodic materials become either polycrystalline or aperiodic (<b>metamict</b> <b>state).</b> We studied the transition from crystalline to aperiodic state in natural materials that have been damaged by alpha recoil nuclei in the U and Th decay series and in synthetic, analogous structure types which have been amorphized by ion implantation.

While Berman's technique of studying radiation damage (DTA and powder diffraction of material which has been se-verely damaged by fission fragments) is of obvious value, we do not agree entirely with his conclusions concerning {{the nature of the}} radiation-damaged AlrO, and the <b>metamict</b> <b>state.</b> The purpose of this note is to review evidence that metamict minerals may not be true glasses and to offer an alternativ...|$|E
40|$|Zonation due to alpha-decay {{damage in}} a natural single crystal of zircon from Sri Lanka is discussed. The zones vary in {{thickness}} {{on a scale from}} one to hundreds of microns. The uranium and thorium concentrations vary from zone to zone such that the alpha decay dose is between 0. 2 x 10 to the 16 th and 0. 8 x 10 to the 16 th alpha-events per milligram. The transition from the crystalline to the aperiodic <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> occurs over this dose range. At doses greater than 0. 8 x 10 to the 16 th alpha events/mg there is no evidence for long-range order. This type of damage will accumulate in actinide-bearing, ceramic nuclear waste forms.

40|$|Bowley (1923) as 'manganomossite ' or {{possibly}} as 'mangano-columbite'. In a later study, Hutton (1957) tentatively identified the mineral as metamict tantalite. In {{a more detailed}} chemical and X-ray diffraction study, Hutton (1959) identified the specimen as metamict columbite. A history of the nomenclature of the specimen {{as well as an}} excellent description of its physical, chemical and structural properties is found in Hutton's (1959) study. The cause for re-examination f the specimen is that it represents he only described occurrence of metamict columbite. Closely related orthorhombic, rare-earth, AB 20 ~-type Nb-Ta-T i oxides (e. g. euxenite, priorite, polycrase, and aeschynite) are often found in the <b>metamict</b> <b>state,</b> but columbite is not. The existence of a metamict colum-bite is of interest in that it may provide a key {{to the understanding of the}} process of metamictization.

The oxygen isotope compositions of carbonateminerals and alteration products in martian meteoritessuggest that this ancient hydrosphere {{was not in}} isotopicequilibrium with the martian lithosphere 1 – 4. Martian meteoriteNWA 7533 is composed of regolith breccia from the heavilycratered terrains of ancient Mars and contains zircon grainsfor which U–Pb ages have been reported 5. Here we reportvariations between the oxygen isotopic compositions offour zircon grains from NWA 7533. We propose that thesevariations can be explained if the mantle melts from whichthe zircon crystallized approximately 4. 43 Gyr ago hadassimiliated 17 O-enriched regolith materials, and that someof the zircon grains, while in a <b>metamict</b> <b>state,</b> were lateraltered by low-temperature fluids near the surface less than 1. 7 Gyr ago. Enrichment of the martian regolith in 17 O beforethe zircon crystallized, presumably through exchange withthe 17 O-enriched atmosphere or hydrosphere during surfacealteration, suggests that the thick primary atmosphere ofMars was lost within the first 120 Myr after accretion. Weconclude that the observed variation of 17 O anomalies in zirconfrom NWA 7533 points to prolonged interaction between themartian regolith, atmosphere and hydrosphere.

40|$|The {{presence}} of trace {{amounts of water}} or hyroxide ion can dramatically affect the response of a mineral to radiation from {{both internal and external}} sources. In zircon, where radioactive decay of U causes structural damage (metamictization), water can enter the structure after a threshold of damage is reached and stabilize the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> by annealing local charge imbalance. Quartz crystals with both amethyst and citrine zones have molecular water in the citrine zones and dominantly hydroxide ion in the amethyst zones. This {{may be due to the}} reduction of the amethyst Fe(IV) color center by atomic H formed by radiolysis of the water. In topaz, special hydroxide sites correlate with the formation of a brown color center. The crystallographically identified hydroxyl on the (OH,D site does not appear to be correlated with radiation damage. The mobility of H and the ease with which H-O species may be formed in silicates appear to explain much of the role of hydrous species in radiation-damage processes in minerals. These species occur in several charge states and may anneal local charge imbalance. The occurrence of trace amounts of water in even nominally anhydrous minerals makes this interaction common...|$|E
40|$|Pyrochlore is {{a common}} {{accessory}} mineral in granite pegmatites, nepheline syenites and carbonatites. Its ability to accomodate many different elements leads {{to a wide range}} of pyrochlore varieties. This is obvious for the U- and Th- contents. The Sokli carbonatite complex ist part of the Kola alkaline province (KAP) in the northern Baltic Shield. The complex ist situated in the area of Savukoski, Finish Lapland, close to the border to Russia. The emplacement age of 360 - 370 Ma falls in the range observerd for other complexes in KAP. The magmatic core was build up in three phases, two magmatic phases separated by a hydrothermal phase. Pyrochlore crystals of the Sokli carbonatite complex show a large chemical variation over the evolution of the magmatic stages, as well as in small rock samples within single stages. This is obvious for the U- and Th- contents. The pyrochlore crystals show a principle change in crystallinity caused by metamictisation due to high U- and Th- concentrations. These high concentrations make pyrochlore useful for age determinations, albeit the <b>metamict</b> <b>state</b> and its modified diffusibility for chemical elements can disturb this. The U- concentration decreases from the early stages of the magmatic evolution to the late stages, to be completely depleted in the last stage. The Th- concentration increases from the early stages until the middle stages, then it decrease to the late stages. Except pyrochlore of rocksample 387 R 170 all structural analyzed pyrochlor crystals show clear reflexes and present the cubic pyrochlore cell unit. During the structural analyses revealed for sample 387 p 1 no reflexes were detected, which demonstrates that the pyrochlore crystal lattice is fully broken down due to the metamictisation caused by the high U- content within a decay time of 370 Ma. The analyzed U-Pb-system of the unaltered metamict pyrochlore show no loss of those elements due to long term diffusion. The slightly over concordant U-Pb-ages show that pyrochlores of carbonatites of the northern Baltic shield are suitable for dating...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} and cell parameters were ascertained on new data from TiNb-Ta complex oxides from the miarolitic pegmatites of the Baveno pink granite (Southern Alps, NW Italy). The crystals are tiny, single or aggregated in small sprays, prismatic or tabular, from yellow-orange to brownish in colour. Typical associated minerals include fluorite, zinnwaldite, gadolinite-group minerals and Sc-minerals. Cavity paragenesis {{is typical of}} NYF pegmatites, and shows two stages of crystallization developing in magmatic-pneumatolitic and hydrothermal conditions. X-ray data show that some oxides belong to the aeschynite mineral group; others are polycrase and fersmite. Aeschynite and polycrase are chemically heterogeneous and structurally disordered because of their <b>metamict</b> <b>state.</b> This disorder does not {{always seem to be}} related to radionuclide contents. Two main trends are indicated, considering the behaviour of Y. The high Y contents fit with very low Ca and LREE contents in the A site; the HREE contents follow the Y trend. In the B site, Ti is the dominant cation, followed by some Nb and very little Ta. Small quantities of Y fit with increasing Ca, U, Th and REE contents. In the B site, Nb cations often exceed those of Ti. The Th contents are often greater than those of U. Besides the already known aeschynite-(Y) and vigezzite, new varieties, 'titano-vigezzite' and 'niobo-aeschynite-(Y) ', are identified here in the Baveno miarolitic cavities. Samples 14 (analysis a) and 2502 (analysis b) have Ca as the main occupant of the I site, followed by Y, Th and REE; in the B site, Ti prevails over Nb. These compositions cannot be considered as pure vigezzrte, but as a new variety called 'tifano-vigezzite'. In the same way, analysis a of sample 3 may be considered a new variety of aeschynite-(Y), with Nb prevailing over Ti in the B site, and here called 'niobo-aeschynite- (Y) '. Neither variety has ever been mentioned in the literature. Epitaxial growth of aeschynite on polycrase (sample 3194) allows some inferences on the crystallization sequence...|$|E
