There is a growing and unfulfilled need for predictive animal models that can improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention. Integration of MRI and NMR could extend the application of experimental data into the clinical setting. This study investigated the ability of MRI and metabolic NMR to detect and quantify inflammation-mediated lung injury. Pulmonary inflammation was induced in male B 6 C 3 F 1 mice by intratracheal administration of IL- 1 β and TNF-α under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice underwent MRI at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after dosing. At 6 and 24 h lungs were harvested for metabolic NMR analysis. Data acquired from IL- 1 β+TNF-α-treated animals were compared with saline-treated control mice. The hyperintense-to-total lung volume (HTLV) ratio derived from MRI was higher in IL- 1 β+TNF-α-treated mice compared with control at 2, 4, and 6 h but returned to control levels by 24 h. The ability of MRI to detect pulmonary inflammation was confirmed by the association between HTLV ratio and histological and pathological end points. Principal component analysis of NMR-detectable metabolites also showed a temporal pattern for which energy metabolism-based biomarkers were identified. These data demonstrate that both MRI and metabolic NMR have utility in the detection and quantification of inflammation-mediated lung injury. Integration of these clinically available techniques into experimental models of lung injury could improve the translation of basic science knowledge and information to the clinic...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Comparative <b>metabolic</b> {{profiling}} by <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) {{is showing}} increasing promise for identifying inter-individual differences to drug response. Two dimensional (2 D) 1 H— 13 C NMR can reduce spectral overlap, {{a common problem}} of 1 D 1 H NMR. However, the peak alignment tools for 1 D NMR spectra are not well suited for 2 D NMR. An automated and statistically robust method for aligning 2 D NMR peaks is required to enable comparative metabonomic analysis using 2 D NMR. Results: A novel statistical method was developed to align NMR peaks that represent the same chemical groups across multiple 2 D NMR spectra. The degree of local pattern match among peaks in different spectra is assessed using a similarity measure, and a heuristic algorithm maximizes the similarity measure for peaks across the whole spectrum. This peak alignment method was used to align peaks in 2 D NMR spectra of endogenous metabolites in liver extracts obtained from four inbred mouse strains {{in the study of}} acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity. This automated alignment method was validated by manual examination of the top 50 peaks as ranked by signal intensity. Manual inspection of 1872 peaks in 39 different spectra demonstrated that the automated algorithm correctly aligned 1810 (96. 7 %) peaks. Availability: Algorithm is available upon request.

40|$|Novel post-genomics {{experiments}} such as metabolomics provide datasets {{that are}} highly multivariate and often reflect an underlying experimental design, developed with a specific experimental question in mind. ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) {{can be used for}} the analysis of multivariate data obtained from an experimental design instead of the widely used principal component analysis (PCA). This increases the interpretability of the model in terms of the experimental question. Aside from the levels of individual factors, variation that can be described by the experimental design may also depend on levels of multiple (crossed) factors simultaneously, e. g. the interactions. ASCA describes each contribution with a PCA model, but a contribution depending on crossed factors may be described more parsimoniously by multiway models like parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The combination of PARAFAC and ASCA, named PARAFASCA, provides a view on the data that is both parsimonious and focused on the experimental question. The novel method is used to analyze a dataset in which the effect of two doses of hydrazine on the urinary chemical composition of rats is investigated by time-resolved <b>metabolic</b> fingerprinting with <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) spectroscopy. This experiment has been conducted to monitor the dose-specific urine composition changes in time upon hydrazine administration. Comparison of the PCA, the ASCA and the PARAFASCA models shows that ASCA and PARAFASCA describe the data more dedicated to the experimental question than PCA, but that PARAFASCA is more parsimonious than ASCA, and separates the variation underlying different effects better. ...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{performance}} of the plant metabolic network, with its varied biosynthetic capacity and its characteristic subcellular compartmentation, remains a considerable challenge. The complexity of the network is such that it is not yet possible to build large-scale predictive models of the fluxes it supports, whether on the basis of genomic and gene expression analysis or on the basis of more traditional measurements of metabolites and their interconversions. This limits the agronomic and biotechnological exploitation of plant metabolism, and it undermines the important objective of establishing a rational metabolic engineering strategy. Metabolic analysis is central to removing this obstacle and currently there is particular interest in harnessing high-throughput and/or large-scale analyses to the task of defining <b>metabolic</b> phenotypes. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) spectroscopy contributes to this objective by providing a versatile suite of analytical techniques for the detection of metabolites and the fluxes between them. The principles that underpin the analysis of plant metabolism by NMR are described, including a discussion of the measurement options for the detection of metabolites in vivo and in vitro, and a description of the stable isotope labelling experiments that provide the basis for metabolic flux analysis. Despite a relatively low sensitivity, NMR is suitable for high-throughput system-wide analyses of the metabolome, providing methods for both metabolite fingerprinting and metabolite profiling, and in these areas NMR can contribute to the definition of plant metabolic phenotypes that are based on metabolic composition. NMR {{can also be used to}} investigate the operation of plant metabolic networks. Labelling experiments provide information on the operation of specific pathways within the network, and the quantitative analysis of steady-state labelling experiments leads to the definition of large-scale flux maps for heterotrophic carbon metabolism. These maps define multiple unidirectional fluxes between branch-points in the metabolic network, highlighting the existence of substrate cycles and discriminating in favourable cases between fluxes in the cytosol and plastid. Flux maps can be used to define a functionally relevant metabolic phenotype and the extensive application of such maps in microbial systems suggests that they could have important applications in characterising the genotypes produced by plant genetic engineering...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{identification}} of reliable markers for diagnosis {{of breast cancer}} has been thoroughly addressed by <b>metabolic</b> profiling using <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) spectroscopy or imaging. Several clear diagnostic indicators have emerged using either in vitro analysis of tissue extracts, ex vivo analysis of biopsies or in vivo direct spectral observations. Most of the breast cancer characteristic metabolites could be assayed by mass spectrometry (MS) to exploit the superior sensitivity of this technique and therefore reduce the traumatic impact of current biopsy procedures. METHODS: Following extraction, aqueous metabolite mixtures were obtained that were submitted to liquid-chromatography, electrospray-ionization, mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) analysis to estimate the content of choline (Cho) and its phosphorylated derivatives, phosphocholine (PCho) and glycerophosphocholine (GPCho). The determinations were performed using 10 samples from breast tissue biopsies, surgical specimens and one single sample of a hepatic metastasis. In addition, some measurements were also repeated using high-resolution ¹H NMR spectroscopy to complement the mass spectrometry results. RESULTS: The contents of Cho, PCho and GPCho in breast tissue extracts were estimated by LC/ESI-MS based on standard compound calibration curves. Sharply increased ratios of phosphorylated-to-unphosphorylated metabolites, PCho/ Cho and (PCho+GPCho) /Cho, were observed in all tumor samples, although without discrimination between benign and malignant lesions, contrary to samples from healthy individuals and from those with fibrocystic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of breast cancer markers by LC/ESI-MS is feasible and diagnostically valuable. In addition to high sensitivity, the approach also shows a resolution advantage for assaying choline derivatives compared to NMR, and could complement the latter...|$|R
40|$|Although {{knowledge}} of metabolic adaptations in cancer has increased dramatically, {{little is known}} about the spontaneous adoptive adaptations of cancer cells to changing conditions in the body. This is particularly important for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells which continually circulate between different microenvironments in the blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes. To study such <b>metabolic</b> adaptations, a <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) based approach; capable of monitoring real-time metabolism in primary CLL cells was developed. Using this setup, this thesis demonstrates fast, reversible metabolic plasticity in CLL cells during transition from normoxic to hypoxic conditions, associated with elevated HIF- 1 α dependent glycolysis. This work also demonstrates differential utilisation of pyruvate in oxygenated and hypoxic conditions where in the latter, pyruvate was actively transported into CLL cells to protect against oxidative stress. Moreover, real-time NMR experiments provided initial evidence that CLL metabolism in hypoxia correlates with stage of disease, adding significant relevance of our method for patient stratification. Additionally, to further investigate alterations between normoxic and hypoxic metabolism, Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) was carried out using primary CLL cell extracts, revealing modifications in pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Despite the recent advent of promising new agents, CLL currently remains incurable and new therapeutic approaches are required. Understanding CLL cell adaptation to changing oxygen availability will permit the development of therapies that interfere with disease aetiology. This study makes several significant contributions towards this goal. Moreover, the findings may be relevant to all migratory cancer cells, and may have importance for the development of strategies to prevent cancer metastasis...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to identify patients with Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) as a molecular diagnosis determines both treatment and prognosis. Genetic testing is currently expensive and many patients are therefore not assessed and are misclassified as having either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Biomarkers could facilitate the prioritisation of patients for genetic testing. We hypothesised that patients with different underlying genetic aetiologies for their diabetes could have distinct metabolic profiles which may uncover novel biomarkers. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform metabolic profiling in urine from patients with MODY due to mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase (GCK) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF 1 A), type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and normoglycaemic control subjects. Urinary <b>metabolic</b> profiling by <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> (NMR) and ultra performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed in a Discovery set of subjects with HNF 1 A-MODY (n = 14), GCK-MODY (n = 17), T 2 D (n = 14) and normoglycaemic controls (n = 34). Data were used to build a valid partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) model where HNF 1 A-MODY subjects could be separated from the other diabetes subtypes. No single metabolite contributed significantly to the separation of the patient groups. However, betaine, valine, glycine and glucose were elevated in the urine of HNF 1 A-MODY subjects compared to the other subgroups. Direct measurements of urinary amino acids and betaine in an extended dataset did not support differences between patients groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Cellular {{metabolic}} dysfunction {{is associated}} with occurrence of multiple-organ failure after critical illness. Glutamine (GLN) attenuates cellular meta-bolic dysfunction in critical illness models. The mechanism of this protection is unclear. We previously demonstrated that GLNs benefit in critical illness {{might be due to}} enhanced heat shock protein (HSP) expression. We hypothesize that GLNs attenuation of cellular metabolic dysfunction is dependent on presence of heat shock factor- 1 (HSF- 1). Meth-ods: HSF- 1 wild-type and knockout mouse embryonic fibro-blasts (HSF- 1 / and HSF- 1 /) were used in all experi-ments. Cells were not treated, or were treated with 8 mmol/L GLN and immediately exposed to heat stress injury (45 °C for 45 minutes). Cells were harvested for <b>metabolic</b> analysis by <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) at 24 hours postinjury. Cell survival was assessed using the MTS assay. Results:GLN treatment in HSF- 1 / cells led to significant attenuation of decreases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) /adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio, phosphomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio, and cell survival observed in non-GLN-treated HSF- 1 / cells. In HSF- 1 / cells, the beneficial effect of GLN on preservation of ATP/ADP ratio, PME/PDE proliferation, and cell survival was lost. GLN-treated HSF- 1 / cells had a significant increase in extracellular lactate concentrations vs GLN-treated HSF/ cells. Conclusions: GLN treatment attenuated cellular metabolic dysfunction and improved cell membrane recovery only in HSF- 1 / cells. Cellular injury, as measured by lactate release and cell survival assay, was improved by GLN treatment in HSF- 1 / cells alone. Thus, GLNs beneficial effect on cellular metabolic dysfunction and cell survival appears to be depen-dent on HSF- 1 expression. (Journal of Parenteral and Entera...|$|R
40|$|Metabolomics is {{the study}} of low {{molecular}} weight biochemical compounds that reflect the physiological state of an organism. Metabolic profiling has been increasingly applied in studies of disease due to the altered metabolic profiles in disease states compared with normal states. Thus, the differential metabolites can be used as biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of specific diseases, alleviating the challenges of the invasive biopsy approach in clinical diagnosis. <b>Metabolic</b> profiling by <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> (NMR) spectroscopy was mainly explored here for its high reproducibility and broad coverage of metabolites, including those not amenable to Mass Spectrometry detection. Sample preparation methodologies (solvent extraction approach) were investigated to facilitate the quantification of metabolites in proteinaceous samples such as blood serum as well as improving the ability of NMR resonance assignments of metabolites in complex biological samples such as urine. The sample preparation methods were implemented in the subsequent study of serum metabolite biomarker discovery of prostate cancer. Biopsy positive and biopsy negative sera NMR metabolic profiles were compared and both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis suggest that 2 -hydroxyvalerate, glycine, fructose, choline and creatine can be used as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Further analysis to confirm the metabolic pathway of these potential biomarkers that are specific to prostate cancer and validation test utilizing additional cohort of samples, will complement this study and provide therapeutic insights. Urine specimens were also studied for the prostate cancer biomarker discovery in order to establish a non-invasive way of cancer diagnosis. Multiple variable selection approaches were assessed and combined to form the panel of potential urinary biomarkers. At last, we performed NMR-based metabolic profiling of bladder cancer and control urine samples to explore the possibility of using urine samples for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. Seven metabolites were statistically significant in differentiating bladder cancer and control samples and further validation of these metabolites is crucial for the establishment of these urinary metabolite biomarkers for clinical diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most {{frequent}} cancers among men worldwide. The varying nature of the cancer and lack of diagnostic tools that can detect prostate cancer and separate the indolent cancers from the aggressive ones, makes it difficult to predict risk, set a diagnosis and determine the best suitable treatment for the individual patient. The malignant prostate cancer cells have altered metabolism that can give an altered metabolic phenotype. The purpose of this study was to investigate the <b>metabolic</b> phenotype, using <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> to compare the metabolic profiles of secretions from prostate cancer cells and non-malignant prostate tissue. Methods: The samples of post prostatic-massage urine were obtained from 50 individuals (CaP = 29, controls = 21). The samples were analyzed on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz/ 54 mm US-Plus operating at 600 MHz for proton. The resulting NMR spectra were examined by different approaches: Metabolite assignment was obtained studying NOESY- and HSQC spectra. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to characterize small and compounded differences between the spectra. The Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) forces the data to confine to groups, and makes a predictive model for class discrimination. Results: From the analysis of the spectra, fifteen metabolites were assigned, whereas the identity of two of these remained uncertain. The results showed that the groups of CaP and controls could be separated with a sensitivity of 71 % and a specificity of 65 %. The metabolites that contributed do these separations were Hippurate, Creatinine, Trigonelline and Trimethylamine-N-Oxide. Conclusion: The study shows that CaP patients can be separated from non-CaP controls with moderate sensitivity and specificity based on the metabolic profile of post prostatic-massage urine samples. The metabolites contributing to the results are of such a nature that one cannot be certain that they can be used as biomarkers for CaP. Further processing and studies of these data is necessary, as there may be other methods that might unveil useful aspects not yet discovered. </p...|$|R
