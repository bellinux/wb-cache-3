The type of battery and number of cells connected is an important consideration when choosing a Battery eliminator circuit (BEC), whether built into the controller or as a stand-alone unit. A higher number of cells connected will result in a reduced power rating and therefore a lower number of servos supported by an integrated BEC, if it uses a linear voltage regulator. A well designed BEC using a switching regulator should not have a similar limitation.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{homogenization}} of two-phase incompressible viscoelastic flows with disordered microstructure. Both phases are modeled as Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic materials. The microscale system contains the conservation of <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> of momentum equations. The inertial terms in the momentum equation incorporate the actual interface advected by the flow. In the constitutive equations, a frozen interface is employed. The interface geometry is arbitrary: we do not assume periodicity, statistical homogeneity or scale separation. The problem is homogenized using G-convergence and oscillating test functions. Since the microscale system is not parabolic, previously known constructions of the test functions do not work here. The test functions developed in the paper are non-local in time and satisfy divergence-free constraint exactly. The latter feature enables us to avoid working with pressure directly. We show that the effective medium is a single phase viscoelastic material {{that is not necessarily}} of Kelvin-Voight type. The effective constitutive equation contains a long memory viscoelastic term, as well as instantaneous elastic and viscous terms...|$|E

With the aim to study the effect of grazing system typologies (GS) and grassland management (GM) on pasture biodiversity a study {{was carried out in}} six livestock farms located into the Dehesa landscape of Sardinia Island. Farms were characterized for some structural and economic traits. Sampling areas were located in thirteen pastures of farms characterized by different GS (beef and dairy cattle and dairy sheep), and by different type of GM (short, medium and long rotation with forage crops). The effects of GS and GM were evaluated on pedological characteristic, forage production and botanical composition of pasture.

40|$|The {{elemental}} fluxes {{and heat}} flow associated with large aquifer {{systems can be}} significant both at local and at regional scales. In fact, large amounts of heat transported by regional groundwater flow can affect the subsurface thermal regime, {{and the amount of}} matter discharged towards the surface by large spring systems can be significant relative to the elemental fluxes of surface waters. The Narni-Amelia regional aquifer system (Central Italy) discharges more than 13 m 3 sec) 1 of groundwater characterised by a slight thermal anomaly, high salinity and high pCO 2. During circulation in the regional aquifer, groundwater reacts with the host rocks (dolostones, limestones and evaporites) and mixes with deep CO 2 -rich fluids of mantle origin. These processes transfer large amounts of dissolved substances, in particular carbon dioxide, and a considerable amount of heat towards the surface. Because practically all the water circulating in the Narni-Amelia system is discharged by few large springs (Stifone-Montoro), the mass and energy balance of these springs can give a good estimation of the mass and heat transported from the entire system towards the surface. By means of a detailed <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> of the aquifer and considering the soil CO 2 fluxes measured from the main gas emission of the region, we computed a total CO 2 discharge of about 7. 8 · 109 mol a) 1 for the whole Narni-Amelia system.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{contribution}} of sex to the occurrence of falls, accounting for comorbidities and differences in physical fitness. Design: This was a cross-sectional study of 587 community-dwelling adults who were older than 50 yrs. Falls, comorbidities (number of diseases and physical impairments), and physical fitness (body composition, lower and upper body strength and flexibility, agility, aerobic endurance, and balance) were evaluated via questionnaires, bioimpedance, and Fullerton batteries, respectively. Results: Compared with the men, the women presented a 10 % higher fall prevalence, 1. 7 more diseases/impairments, 10 % more body fat, 26 % less lean body mass, and poorer physical capacity (P < 0. 05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2. 723; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 190 – 6. 230) increased the likelihood of falling, after adjustment for comorbidities (OR, 1. 213; 95 % CI, 1. 109 – 1. 328), lean mass (OR, 0. 958; 95 % CI, 0. 927 – 0. 989), fat mass (OR, 1. 053; 95 % CI, 1. 021 – 1. 086), and balance (OR, 0. 942; 95 % CI, 0. 914 – 0. 971), which were the main risk factors of falls. Conclusions: Women are more susceptible to falling, presumably because they have poorer health and physical fitness than do men. However, when the values for comorbidities, lean and fat body <b>mass,</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> were similar, the men demonstrated a higher probability of falling.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityChildren's access to many sports is restricted because of social and equipment costs, in addition the equipment is not frequently designed to suit a child's physique and capabilities. Generally the design of sports equipment for children proceeds by taking adult equipment and scaling it down. Unfortunately this often means that the range of equipment is limited for a population whose dimensions are constantly changing and whose strength to size ratio does not vary linearly (Beak et al. 2000). The use of inappropriate equipment can significantly affect learning skills and cause the development of bad habits which may take years to correct and can be a major detractor to further participation (Sleap 1981). It is apparent that little science {{has been applied to}} equipment design for children and if wider participation is to be encouraged then well-designed and manufactured equipment that matches child development and growth rates needs to be produced. The intentions of this study were: • To determine the effect of equipment properties on children's, aged between 7 and I 0 years old, ability to generate effective strokes in two example sports: golf and tennis. • To determine whether any relationships existed between children's physical characteristics (e. g. height, strength etc), equipment properties and performance. • To apply any fitting guidelines established to a group of subject to test their validity. In each sport 3 major equipment properties were examined and a sample of 30 children, aged between 7 and I 0 years old of varying ability, were tested in each of the studies. Sixteen anthropometric measures, age, experience and grip strength were taken from each child. This information was examined with the performance data using multiple regression methods to determine whether any fitting relationships existed between child characteristics, performance and club or racket properties. In golf {{it was found that the}} club head mass, shaft flexibility and shaft length all significantly affected the distance achieved with 7 -iron clubs, whilst in tennis the racket length, <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> all had a significant effect on the power and placement of forehand tennis strokes. Nomograms were constructed for the tennis and golf fitting equations to provide a graphical representation of the fitting so that manufacturers, tennis coaches, club fitters and professional golfers can quickly determine correct club or racket characteristics for a child. The main conclusion of this study is that children should be considered as individuals instead ofbeing grouped into age or height categories. Children should be fitted to equipment in terms of their size, strength and ability if effective equipment that is more suited to their needs can be constructed...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on studies of the ten-year {{community-based}} intervention programme entitled, the Vadstena Osteoporosis Prevention Project (VOPP). The specific aims of the research were to describe the effects of physical activity and training programmes on bone <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>balance</b> performance in adults, {{to determine whether a}} fall risk prevention programme could motivate personal actions among the elderly, to ascertain whether the intervention programme could reduce the incidence of forearm and hip fractures. Two studies addressed training programmes for middle-aged and old people. First, VOPP participants who were aged 40 – 70 years and had low forearm bone mineral density (BMD) values were invited {{to take part in a}} one-year weight-bearing training study. Thirty of those individuals were included in the investigation. Additional bone mass measurements were performed at the hip and the lumbar spine, and balance and aerobic capacity were also tested. The training programme was performed twice a week (I). In the second study, healthy persons aged 70 – 75 years were invited to participate in a balance-training study. Fifteen persons joined an exercise group, and another fifteen were controls. The training programme comprised specific balance exercises and was carried out twice a week for nine weeks (II). The association between forearm BMD values and several lifestyle factors was explored in random samples of the population aged 20 – 72 years (n= 880) in a cross-sectional study (III). Another study explored the association between calcaneal stiffness, forearm BMD, and lifestyle factors amongst participants aged 20 – 79 years (n= 956) at the final registration of the VOPP (V). Effects of the VOPP interventions directed at environmental risk factors for falls and the promotion of physical activity were examined in people aged ≥ 65 years (IV). The incidence of forearm and hip fractures was studied amongst middle-aged and elderly individuals in the intervention and the control communities during the study period 1987 – 2001 (VI). The exercise group (n= 15) in the weight-bearing training study showed increases in BMD at the greater trochanter (p< 0. 01), one-leg stance balance with the eyes closed and coordination tests (p< 0. 05), and aerobic capacity (p< 0. 05). No significant difference was found when the groups were compared concerning changes in the different tests during the intervention period (I). In the balance-training study, the exercise group showed post-training improvement in the following tests: standing on the right leg with eyes closed (p< 0. 01), standing on the right leg (p< 0. 01) and on the left leg (p< 0. 05) while turning the head, and walking 30 metres (p< 0. 01). There were significant differences between the groups in these tests when changes were compared at the post-intervention test (II). Age (p< 0. 0001) and body mass index (p≤. 0001) were associated with forearm BMD in both sexes. Reported moderate physical activity levels in men were positively associated with forearm BMD (p< 0. 05) (III). In both sexes, reported moderate (p< 0. 05) and high (women p< 0. 05 and men p< 0. 001) physical activity levels were positively associated with calcaneal stiffness. The correlation coefficient between forearm BMD and calcaneal stiffness was 0. 58 in women and 0. 34 in men (V). Persons aged ≥ 65 years at the follow-up in 1994 reported more use of shoe/cane spikes and moderate physical activity levels compared to controls (IV). There was no change in the general incidence of forearm and hip fractures between the communities for the study period. However, there was a tendency towards decreasing incidence of forearm and trochanteric hip fracture in both sexes during the late intervention period in the intervention community (VI). A community-based intervention programme aimed at reducing the incidence of osteoporotic fractures must be regarded as a long-term project and should preferably be monitored over an extended post-intervention period.

The important part of condensation theory—the calculation of the water droplet growth model in the transition zone—is not ideal; thus, it is necessary to develop a water droplet growth model with full-scale range. On the basis of the heat <b>and</b> <b>mass</b> transfer equilibrium in droplet growth, a coupled model of heat <b>and</b> <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> for droplet growth is proposed.
