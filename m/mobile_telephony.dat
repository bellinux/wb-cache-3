5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the first study of the uses of <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony</b> based on the {{collection}} and analysis of naturally occurring <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony.</b> We show how a characteristic feature of <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony,</b> which makes it differ from any other kind of mediated interaction, is that: a) the participants may orient the camera at will to shoot almost any feature within their environment; and b) what they actually show at a given moment may be (and usually is) inspected by the recipient for its relevance to the ongoing interaction, and is produced with an orientation towards such scrutiny. A specific concern of mobile video call users at any time is therefore what they should or should not show. We demonstrate how a partial solution to that problem is the reliance on a particular (full) portrait-like ‘talking heads’ format as an expected default mode for interaction in mobile video calls. Finally, we discuss the implications, for design, of such an empirically grounded understanding of the specific practical concerns of <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony</b> users...|$|R

40|$|The {{mobile phone}} allowed people to {{communicate}} {{when and where}} they wanted, dramatically changing how audio telephony was integrated into daily life. With video telephony services now available on everyday mobile phones, comparable arguments are being made that this will change how people relate to and use video <b>telephony.</b> The <b>mobile</b> and personal natures of mobile phones remove factors that previously hindered use of video telephony. Mobility also brings new challenges and concerns that may hinder use of video telephony in particular contexts. With this in mind, the paper revisits the notion of video telephony but {{within the context of}} mobile phones. A study is presented of people’s everyday use of <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony</b> using diary techniques and ethnographic interviews. The study uses real episodes to highlight key motivations and circumstances under which <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony</b> was and wasn’t used.

40|$|Providing {{high-quality}} {{video for}} packet-switched wireless video telephony on handheld devices is a challenging task due to packet loss, varying bandwidth, and end-to-end delay constraints. While many error resilience techniques {{have been proposed}} for video transmission over wireless channels, only a few were specifically designed for <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony.</b> We propose a low-complexity channel-adaptive error resilience technique for packet-switched <b>mobile</b> video <b>telephony,</b> which combines rateless coding, feedback, and reference picture selection. In contrast to previous approaches, our technique uses cumulative feedback at every transmission opportunity and predicts when decoding is likely to fail so that reference picture selection can be triggered at an early stage. Experimental results for H. 264 video sequences show that the proposed technique can achieve improvements of 1. 64 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio over benchmark techniques in simulated Long-Term Evolution networks...|$|R

25|$|Nokia also {{acquired}} Mobira, a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> company, {{which was}} the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network {{and the first to}} allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (Teléfonos de México), privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the United States. Other {{players in the}} domestic industry are Axtel and Maxcom. Because of Mexican orography, providing a landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans {{over the age of}} 14 own a mobile phone. <b>Mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.

25|$|Peru was reintegrated {{into the}} global {{economic}} system, and began to attract foreign investment. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, {{at a cost of}} $607 for a residential line. A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days. Peru's Physical land based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000, and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line. Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization). Privatization also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea gas project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.|$|E
25|$|The {{company has}} had various {{industries}} in its 152-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, {{but since the}} 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development and licensing. Nokia is also {{a major contributor to}} the <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> industry, having assisted {{in the development of the}} GSM, 3G and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world, its dominance also extending into the smartphone industry. After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former, with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014. After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French-American telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings). The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global.|$|E
25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E
