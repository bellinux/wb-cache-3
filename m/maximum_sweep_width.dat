The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL) is developing requirements for an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) UAV that supports rapid planning and decision making for multiple concurrent operations, and facilitates maneuver and precision engagement. Additionally, acquisition of a 2008 Pioneer replacement is underway at Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM).

Intensive arable agriculture on hilltops will first expose and then pulverize artifacts such as pottery and even chipped stone (typically flint, chert or obsidian) flakes. Conversely, the plateau and upper scarp or valley side soils will move down slope, forming a deep seal over low-lying archaeological deposits, rendering them inaccessible to surface survey. Even artifacts {{on the surface and}} with relatively high visibility (i.e., little obscuring vegetation), however, are not consistently detected by surveyors.

CEST effects compete with direct water saturation and conventional MT processes, and generally {{can only be}} quantified through an asymmetry analysis of the water saturation spectrum (Z-spectrum) {{with respect to the}} water frequency, a process that is exquisitely sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Here it is shown that direct water saturation imaging allows measurement of the absolute water frequency in each voxel, allowing proper centering of Z-spectra on a voxel-by-voxel basis independently of spatial B 0 field variations. Optimal acquisition parameters for this "water saturation shift referencing" (WASSR) approach were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations and later confirmed experimentally.

30|$|This section {{emphasizes}} on optimizing {{the values of}} production and injection parameters of the optimum scenario by improving the oil recovery factor and <b>maximum</b> <b>sweep</b> for the reservoir. Tubing wellhead pressure (THP) and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) are used to control the drawdown of reservoir. BHP corresponds, where operator has installed control valves (subsurface), otherwise well head pressure (WHP) {{is used as a}} control mode. BHP is denoted by pwf (flowing bottom-hole pressure) or pws (shut in pressure). According to Darcy law the lesser the BHP, the higher the drawdown and the more will be the oil recovery. The same principle is applied to THP as well, however, if the THP decreases and BHP increases, this indicates liquid load up in the well. Therefore, in the scenarios 4, these two controlling factors are optimized. Table  3 and Table  4 provide details on injection well control parameters. It can be seen that the well control parameter (I) is controlled by the tubing head pressure (THP) and well control (GI) is controlled by the reservoirs rate.|$|R

40|$|A scissor wing configuration, {{consisting}} of two independently sweeping wings was numerically studied. This configuration was also compared with an equivalent fixed wing baseline. Aerodynamic and stability and control characteristics of these geometries were investigated {{over a wide range}} of flight Mach numbers. It is demonstrated that in the purely subsonic flight regime, the scissor wing can achieve higher aerodynamic efficiency as the result of slightly higher aspect ratio. In the transonic regime, the lift to drag ratio of the scissor wing is shown to be higher than that of the baseline, for higer values of the lift coefficient. This tends to make the scissor wing more efficient during transonic cruise at high altitudes as well as during air combat at all altitudes. In supersonic flight, where the wings are maintained at <b>maximum</b> <b>sweep</b> angle, the scissor wing is shown to have a decided advantage in terms of reduced wave drag.

40|$|Steady state mapping is {{fundamental}} to optimizing IC engine operation. Engine variables are set, a predefined settling time elapses, and then engine data are logged. This is an accurate but time consuming approach to engine testing. In contrast the sweep method seeks to speed up data capture by continuously moving the engine through its operating envelope without dwelling. This is facilitated by the enhanced capability of modern test rig control systems. The purpose of this work is to compare the accuracy and repeatability of the sweep approach under experimental conditions, with that of steady state testing. Limiting factors for {{the accuracy of the}} sweep approach fall into two categories. Firstly on the instrumentation side - transducers have a characteristic settling time. Secondly on the engine side - thermal and mechanical inertias will mean that instantaneous measurements of engine parameters differ from the steady state values. These errors can be reduced to satisfactory levels by modelling the engine and instrumentation responses.
