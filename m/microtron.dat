50|$|The MAMI {{accelerator}} {{consists of}} four cascaded microtrons, an injector linac, a thermal source for unpolarized electrons and a laser-driven source for electrons with 80% spin polarization. The operation principle {{is based on the}} continuous wave (cw) <b>microtron</b> technique. There thebeam is recirculated many times through a normal-conduction linear accelerating structurewith a moderate energy gain per turn. Due to constant, homogenous magnetic bending fields the length of the beam path is increasing with energy after each turn. The magnetic fields, the radio-frequency (rf)used to accelerate the electrons and the energy gain per turnhave to be adjusted to meet the <b>microtron</b> coherence condition, i.e. the condition that the length of each path is an integer factor of the rf wavelength. This <b>microtron</b> scheme makes efficient use of the rf power and the inherent strong longitudinal phase focussing guarantees excellent beam quality and stability.|$|E

40|$|To {{satisfy the}} demands of the parity {{violation}} experiment at MAMI, the energy of the 855 MeV c. w. electron beam de-livered by three cascaded racetrack <b>microtrons</b> (RTM 1 - 3) has to be stabilized to about 10 − 6. For this purpose a fast and a slow feedback loop has been installed. Provided that the longitudinal tune is well adjusted, the fast loop elimi-nates output energy deviations by acting on the RF-phase of RTM 3. The slow loop stabilizes the online measured tune of this last stage by small changes of the RTM 3 linac amplitude. To get the beam energy and the tune with the necessary accuracy, two features unique to an RTM are exploited, namely the large longitudinal dispersion of the 180 ◦ bending magnets and the large number of recircula-tions. In this paper the principal setup of the high precision beam energy stabilisation is shown and first results are pre-sented. ...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{highlight}} a way of producing radionuclides in a patient, thus providing information that may be complementary to that from traditional nuclear medicine. Therefore, we describe a positron emission tomography (PET) study in a male patient after high-energy photon treatment of the pelvis minor because of the local spread of prostate cancer. The examination was done {{as an extension of}} earlier work described in [5] which was an attempt to verify the dose location of the radiation beams.

This 9 cell on-axis coupled structure operates at 3 GHz and was designed with a relatively large aperture radius (8 mm) in order to avoid limitations on the RTM’s acceptance. Design, fabrication and testing of the structures have been done in house. For the design of the structures the combination of the codes Superfish and Mafia has been used.

Electrons have been used in radiotherapy since the early 1950 s, first produced by betatrons and then by <b>microtrons</b> and linacs. Modern high energy linacs typically provide, in addition to two megavoltage photon energies, several electron beam energies in the range from 4 to 22 MeV. 8. 1. 1. General shape of the depth dose curve The general shape of the central axis depth dose curve for electron beams differs from that of photon beams (see Fig. 8. 1). Figure 8. 1 (a) shows depth doses for various electron beam energies and Fig. 8. 1 (b) shows depth doses for 6 and 15 MV X ray beams. Typically, the electron beam central axis depth dose curve exhibits a high surface dose (compared with megavoltage photon beams), and the dose then builds up to a maximum at a certain depth referred to as the electron beam depth of dose maximum z max. Beyond z max the dose drops off rapidly and levels off at a small low level dose component referred to as the bremsstrahlung tail. These features offer a distinct clinical advantage over the conventional X ray modalities {{in the treatment of}} superficial tumours...|$|R

These sources of electron beam are the most efficient equipment for applications with a relatively low beam current and medium energies ranging from 2 MeV to 100 MeV. The aim of the present thesis is to perform studies of some aspects of the RTMs. One part of the thesis is devoted to the design and development of magnetic elements with permanent magnets of two RTMs for different applications. The first one, which is currently under construction at the UPC (Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña), is a novel accelerator with the beam energy variable between 6 MeV and 12 MeV for medical applications (Intraoperative Radiation Therapy treatments). The other machine is a 55 MeV RTM for the detection of explosives by means of photonuclear reactions, which is at the stage of tests at the Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP).
