5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|Salford is {{credited}} as {{the birthplace of}} the Bush Roller Chain. Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E

Water mill batteries are also known from Amida in Asia Minor, the Janiculum hill in Rome, and a number of other places throughout the empire.|$|E

25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, {{voltage regulation}} is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing spring tension or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|E
25|$|A {{hydraulic}} power network {{is a system}} of interconnected pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> from a power source, like a pump, to hydraulic equipment like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few {{hydraulic power}} transmission networks are still in use; modern hydraulic equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E
25|$|Newman's Energy Machine was a DC motor {{which the}} inventor, Joseph Newman, claimed to produce <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> {{exceeding}} the electrical power being supplied to it (an over-unity or perpetual motion device). In 1979, Newman attempted to patent the device, but {{was rejected by}} the United States Patent Office. When the rejection was later appealed, the United States district court requested that Newman's machine be tested by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The NBS concluded in June 1986 that output power was not greater than the input, and it was not a perpetual motion machine. Thus, the patent was again denied. The scientific community has rejected Newman's ideas about electricity and magnetism as pseudoscientific and his claims as false.|$|E
