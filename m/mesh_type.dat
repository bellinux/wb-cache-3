A robust and simple experimental protocol {{and a set of}} parameters is proposed, addressing stiffness under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions, anisotropy, influence of prior deformation history, local mismatch of deformation mechanisms, and changes in mechanical properties when embedded in a homogeneous matrix. These parameters can form the basis for comparison of different <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> and for evaluation of their mechanical biocompatibility. Measurements were performed on nine <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> used for hernia and/or pelvic repair, including heavier as well as lighter implants and covering a wide range of mechanical responses.

In a constant mesh gearbox, the transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but the gears are not rigidly connected to the shafts on which they rotate.

The previous sliding mesh transmission required the gears to be spinning {{at roughly the same}} speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> FSS {{is created}} from a patch type FSS {{in such a}} way that the metal {{portions}} or the former are replaced by aperture portions of the latter, then the two FSS are said to be duals of one another. Duality only strictly applies when no dielectric substrates are present, therefore it is only approximately satisfied in practice, though even when dielectric substrates are present, duality can be useful in FSS design. As a side note, Pathological FSS patterns such as a checkerboard FSS may be treated as the limit of the patch and mesh as the patch (and aperture) size approaches the unit cell size, with electrical connections of the mesh retained in the limit. For dual FSS, the reflection coefficient of the patch will be equal to the transmission coefficient of the mesh.|$|E

Based on the rate-dependent crystal {{plasticity}} theory, {{a finite}} element code which considers crystallographic slip as deformation mechanism of material {{was developed to}} investigate the stress–strain response of the β phase of Ti- 5553 during uniaxial tension. Three dimensional models with random grain shapes generated by Voronoi tessellation were used for simulations, and two discretization methods were used to disperse the models. Firstly, the parameters of material were identified by fitting simulation stress-strain curves with experimental data. Then the global stress-strain curves were calculated, and effects of <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> and mesh density were discussed. Results show that <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> has a relatively significant influence on overall responses, whereas the influence of mesh density is slight. Investigate of local stress-strain response in each grain was also conducted, and obvious inter-granular heterogeneities were observed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{experimental}} analysis of residence time distribution and phase hold-up in a mesh microreactor. A microreactor, where a finely weaved mesh is sandwiched between two flat plates with specific inlets for gas and liquid, is proposed. The microvolumes formed upon sandwiching the mesh are totally connected and thus it yields a view of several interconnected microvolumes. This system is easy to build and does not need precision micromachining. A high-speed photographic analysis yielded the phase distribution for different <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> over a wide range of operating gas and liquid flow rates. The RTD was studied by measuring the liquid phase conductivity at the outlet of the reactor. Channeling prevailed for mesh with smaller open area. The ADEM was used for fitting the tracer curves with tailing ends. The RTD and the image analysis for all the <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> showed hysteresis when the gas flow rate was maintained constant and the liquid flow rate was gradually increased and then decreased.

The numerical models considered the nonlinear constitutive equation with strain rate effect, large deformation theory, and self-contact control. The full histories of deformation in simple model, complete model and adaptive model are simulated successfully. With the different groove depths of 3, 4, 7, 10, 12 and 15 mm, different <b>mesh</b> <b>types,</b> and boundary conditions, the correspondent results of simulations are assessed. Detail discussions of the absorbed energy and buckling resistance of the different ribbed sheets on varying boundary conditions are presented. Furthermore, the various <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> are examined in the simulations. And, the results of simulations are compared with the previous experimental works; the impact load of the suggested numerical model is in good agreement with the experiment. The main benefit of the proposed models will save the tremendous costs in the die designing and specimen producing while on the experimental works.

40|$|Pelvic floor {{reconstruction}} {{is usually}} accompanied with the implantation of a surgical mesh, which frequently {{results in a}} foreign body response with associated complications. An ideal surgical mesh that allows force generation of muscle tissues without significant granulation tissue and/or fibrosis is of significant clinical interest. In this dissertation, the in vitro and in vivo responses of a chitosan coating on high molecular weight polypropylene mesh (Ch-PPM) in comparison with commercially available meshes were explored. In the first study, we found that application of a 0. 5 % (w/v) Ch-PPM elicited preferential attachment of myoblasts over fibroblast attachment in vitro. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that 0. 5 % Ch-PPM will encourage skeletal muscle tissue ingrowth and decrease fibrosis formation in vivo. In the second topic of investigation, we implanted 0. 5 % Ch-PPM, collagen-coated polypropylene mesh (PelvitexTM; C. R. Bard), and polypropylene (Avaulta Solo®; C. R. Bard) alone using a rat abdominal defect model. Force generation capacity and inflammatory response of each mesh were evaluated 2, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. We found that chitosan coating {{is associated with the}} restoration of functional skeletal muscle with histomorphologic characteristics that resemble native muscle and an early macrophage phenotypic response that has previously been shown to lead to more functional outcomes. Finally, we tested the <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> in the same in vivo rat abdominal defect model to: 1) establish a relationship between the ratio of collagen types I/III and mechanical strength, and 2) determine the collagen deposition and mechanical strength of a chitosan-coated polypropylene mesh. By characterizing the inflammatory response, muscle contractility, and structural properties of <b>mesh</b> <b>types</b> after introduction in a small animal model, we hope to provide more insight for clinicians to reach a more educated decision for selection of a particular material for pelvic floor repair. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
