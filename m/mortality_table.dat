While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse <b>mortality</b> <b>table,</b> the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising cost of health care, the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay for health insurance. Transit workers currently do not pay for health insurance.|$|E

It describes the construction of generational <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> {{and the creation of}} RBNS claims reserves. Besides the demonstration of these models, the work analyzes the results of calculating reserves in accordance with generational <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> and actual <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> of the Czech Republic. An impor- tant element in provision calculating is the simulation of future life expectancy of the insured, i. e. random generation of life expectancy based on generational mortality data. Characteristics of the distribution of reserves are derived from simulations. Furthermore, we compare the results of stochastic and determi- nistic approach of computing the reserves.

Additional data from government sources was used to improve the information of the companies&# 8217; databases. The mortality rates of the population under risk products (death coverage) are remarkably different than those under savings products (survivorship coverage); as such, four different <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> are constructed, separating the population by sex as well as the type of insurance coverage. A straight comparison between the BR-EMS 2015 tables with the statistics of the general Brazilian population shows a striking difference on life expectancies.
