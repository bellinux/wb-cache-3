40|$|This Atlas was {{initiated}} {{as part of}} Ireland's preparation for the Water Framework Directive (WFD) which, inter alia, required mapping the distribution of mobile fishing gears in coastal waters (inside 1 n mile outside the base lines). The Atlas subsequently expanded the geographical extent of the review out to 12 n miles. The history, descriptive terminology and extent of subdivisions of the territorial sea are provided. The Atlas {{is a collection of}} 1, 885 polygons showing the distribution of fishing and fishery related activities, including aquaculture and mariculture within the Republic of Ireland's territorial sea and internal marine waters. The Atlas demonstrates that the greatest range and intensity of fishing and related activities are undertaken in the internal waters of the State. Hook and line fishing emerged as the most widely used metier and a combined array of <b>mobile</b> <b>gears,</b> ranging from pelagic otter trawls to hydraulic dredges, took second place. The total area occupied by fishing and fishing related activities was just under 125, 000 km 2. The principal metier groupings within 12 n miles were: hook and line occupying 57, 000 km 2 (45 % of the total), <b>mobile</b> <b>gears</b> (towed enclosing nets and dredges) accounting for 27, 530 km 2 (22 %). Passive nets (static tangle and gill nets and the now defunct salmon drift nets) made up 18, 000 km 2 (14 %). Pots targeting crustaceans and molluscs occupied 13, 250 km 2 (11 %). Aquaculture and mariculture occupied 172 km 2, some 0. 4 % of the area within 12 n miles. To supplement the polygons, a table of metier and species combinations in internal and territorial waters opposite each county with a long shoreline is supplied. The table includes fisheries whose existence is known but not their extent. The consequences for benthic community structure of the use of a particular metier, the purpose of the exercise for the WFD, are considered. "Community" refers to fish or invertebrate species assemblages. Applications for the data are discussed {{in the context of a}} growing appreciation of the need to plan the use of inshore waters for fishery conservation and to accommodate a wide range of stakeholder interests and to embrace the ecosystem approach to maritime governance. Difficulties inherent in conserving fish species rather than biological communities are illustrated by reference to a case history. Data presented in the document were sourced from the tacit knowledge of stakeholders. Planning jurisdiction in the Republic of Ireland is described with reference to inshore waters. Recent thinking by fishery commentators is reviewed. Finally, current thinking on inshore spatial planning within the EU and particularly among our nearest neighbours is discussed and the possibility of implementing ICZM is briefly considered. This document is presented as Version 1 of a continuing exercise. Governmental departmental arrangements and collected data refer to the period up to 2006. The Atlas should be periodically revised as more information becomes available. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need {{to take into account}} a “mixed fisheries” approach in management, assessment and sampling of fish stocks. To do this effectively it is necessary for groups of fishing trips with homogeneous fishing patterns or tactics to be defined into métiers. Presented here is the result of an Irish case study analysis in applying multivariate statistics to declared logbook landings to define Irish fleet métiers operating in the Irish Sea. Established multivariate statistical procedures, a combination of factorial and cluster analysis, were applied to five variables; landing profile, vessel length category, gear, mesh size range and month. The investigation has shown this methodology to be a suitable tool in identifying métiers without prior assumptions and enabled data to be described from a multivariate statistical perspective providing useful and informative results. In total twenty-two métiers were identified and defined from 2003 landings data, and a further 5 groups were formed to include trips which could not be assigned to a métier. Definitions were applied to 2003 - 2005 landings and effort data to examine their dynamics and stability. The dominant métier (in terms of effort and trips) contained high proportions of landed Nephrops taken by bottom otter trawlers using 70 - 89 mm meshes. The effort in this métier was fairly stable over time. The greatest increases in effort and trip allocation occurred within métiers employing pots and traps for crustacean species. A small number of minor métiers (in terms of landings and effort) became obsolete over the three years examined. The effects of recent management measures are likely to have contributed to declines in the numbers of trips and effort in some métiers. For example, days-at-sea, limited <b>mobile</b> <b>gears</b> such as bottom otter trawls and beam trawls with ≥ 100 mm mesh, have declined. Such changes within métiers over recent years have contributed to a deeper understanding of fleet dynamics in the Irish Sea. This analysis has identified and highlighted a segment of polyvalent Irish fishing vessels, which move between several métiers within a year. The definition of métiers can be used to enhance the Irish sampling programme in the Irish Sea by developing a finer scale, métier based, stratification of sampling. This in turn enables increased precision and robustness of national assessment data thus improving assessments and management advice. Defining métiers will prove advantageous in developing mixed fisheries assessments and advice. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. A private power company, Cape Wind Inc., {{wants to}} develop the largest wind farm in United States history {{off the coast of}} Cape Cod Massachusetts in a twenty-five square mile area of Nantucket Sound known as Horseshoe Shoal (HSS). However, Cape Wind must compete for the use of this area with the Massachusetts <b>mobile</b> <b>gear</b> {{fishermen}} who hold coastal access permits endorsed with squid and fluke (CAPsquid, fluke). A contingent valuation (CV) telephone survey was administered to 34 potential HSS <b>mobile</b> <b>gear</b> users (n= 140 potential users). The CV hypothetical scenario invites fishermen to enter into a class action law suit against Cape Wind for possible compensation if development rights are granted to this area. The scenario suggests that the law suit would at least delay development of this area for one more year. A type of Coasian bargain is then presented, where fishermen are endowed with the unimpeded use rights to this area for the next year, and must choose the minimum amount {{they would be willing to}} accept (WTA) to settle the lawsuit today and forego this extra year of fishing free from a wind farm.

40|$|Approximately {{two decades}} ago, snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) were {{discovered}} in the Barents Sea.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of fishing capacity requires reliable estimates of current capacity, {{and to this}} end most countries have developed a form of capacity measure usually based on some physical characteristics of the fleet. In the United Kingdom, the "capacity" measurement system currently in place is {{used as the basis}} of existing capacity reduction programmes. Each vessel has a number of Vessel Capacity Units (VCUs) defined by its size and engine power. An assumption is made that this measure is related to the ability of the fleet to catch fish. More recently, techniques have been developed to measure capacity directly in terms of potential output. In this paper, the fishing capacity of a sample of UK otter trawlers and a set of boats that primarily use static gear (i. e. nets and lines) is estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates are made on a species-by-species basis for the key species harvested. These are compared to the existing measures of physical capacity. The results suggest that VCUs may provide a reasonable approximation of fishing capacity for fleets using <b>mobile</b> <b>gear,</b> but may be inappropriate for fleets using static gear.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of <b>mobile</b> fishing <b>gear</b> on the habitat and {{productivity}} of the sea bottom has warranted attention for several centuries, recent concern has fueled an upsurge in research into the ecosystem effects of fishing over the last decade. This dissertation addresses {{the effects of}} <b>mobile</b> fishing <b>gear</b> disturbance on the benthic megafaunal productivity, scavenging amphipods and isopods, and benthic habitat-mediated survival of juvenile cod (Gadus morhua). ^ Using baited traps, scavenging amphipod and isopod populations were sampled at deep and shallow sites in disturbed and undisturbed areas on {{the northern part of}} Georges Bank and in the Great South Channel from 1996 – 1999. Multivariate exploratory statistics revealed the most important grouping variable for these populations was depth. Any long-term effects of disturbance associated with scallop dredging and fish trawling on this part of the benthic community was overshadowed by the influence of depth on the distribution of populations of these scavenging invertebrates. ^ Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the effects of habitat complexity on the survival of juvenile cod in the presence of an ambush predator, the sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus). Strike success was significantly lower in the intermediate complexity habitats versus the low and high complexity habitats. Some degree of habitat complexity confers a survival benefit on juvenile cod in the presence of this piscivorous ambush predator. ^ The gravel pavement on the northern part of Georges Bank was sampled from 1994 – 2000 with a 1 -m wide Naturalists 2 ̆ 7 dredge to assess the effects of <b>mobile</b> fishing <b>gear</b> on benthic megafaunal production. Sidescan sonar surveys, fishing records, and photographic transects allowed us to identify and to sample disturbed and undisturbed areas. In addition, the closure of large parts of Georges Bank in late 1994 created recovering areas. At the shallow, recovering Site 17, production increased markedly from 1994 to 2000. Production remained comparatively static and low at the chronically disturbed Site 18 over the same sampling period. At the deep sites, production remained markedly lower at the disturbed Site 13 compared to the undisturbed Site 20 over the sampling period. ...|$|R

40|$|Deep-water gorgonian corals are {{long-lived}} organisms found worldwide off continental {{margins and}} seamounts, usually occurring at depths of ∼ 200 - 1, 000 m. Most corals undergo sexual reproduction by releasing a planktonic larval stage that disperses; however, recruitment {{rates and the}} environmental and biological factors influencing recruitment in deep-sea species are poorly known. Here, we present results from a 4 -year field experiment conducted in the Gulf of Maine (northwest Atlantic) at depths > 650 m that document recruitment for 2 species of deep-water gorgonian corals, Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea. The abundance of P. resedaeformis recruits was high, and influenced by the structural complexity of the recipient habitat, but very few recruits of P. arborea were found. We suggest that divergent reproductive modes (P. resedaeformis as a broadcast spawner and P. arborea as a brooder) may explain this pattern. Despite the high recruitment of P. resedaeformis, severe mortality {{early on in the}} benthic stage of this species may limit the abundance of adult colonies. Most recruits of this species (∼ 80 %) were at the primary polyp stage, and less than 1 % of recruits were at stage of 4 polyps or more. We propose that biological disturbance, possibly by the presence of suspension-feeding brittle stars, and limited food supply in the deep sea may cause this mortality. Our findings reinforce the vulnerability of these corals to anthropogenic disturbances, such as trawling with <b>mobile</b> <b>gear,</b> and the importance of incorporating knowledge on processes during the early life history stages in conservation decisions...|$|R

The decline of the commercial hunting trade {{that began in the}} late 19 th century is outlined to illustrate that despite a difference of 100 years, social, political and biological similarities accompanied the decline of commercial harvest of fin fish and game. The research examines the rise of the recreational fishing paradigm {{and its impact on the}} commercial fisheries vis-a-vis legislation and the organization of interest known as the recreation/conservation complex. The politics of group formation and maintenance are discussed to provide a theoretical framework to understand the motivation and role of the political entrepreneur in the public policy formation and implementation process. Differences in the degree of gentrification of the inshore finfisheries occur because of the dominance of the traditional commercial fisheries in the northeast and the increasing importance of sport fishing in the Gulf of Mexico and mid-Atlantic regions. The rise of recreational paradigm for wildlife occurred before the rise of the recreational paradigm for the fisheries because of differences in their rate of exploitation. The first two hundred years of the exploitation of the inshore fisheries was governed by management regimes that limited entry, capital and effort. Whereas the first two hundred years of the exploitation of the wildlife was governed by open-access and free-taking of resources that were considered common property. As societies have realized that their resources are diminishing their highest use becomes less-consumptive, giving rise to the recreational paradigm and the gentrification of the living natural resources...|$|R

40|$|Research PaperThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to model and measure shadow prices for quota that are not only vessel-specific but also conditioned upon the fisher's own quota holdings and individual circumstances regarding fishing effort. Shadow prices reflect the scarcity value of quota to each particular fisher and can be used to determine the maximum amount that each fisher {{would be willing to pay}} in order to purchase a one unit increase in quota. The fishery of interest is the Canadian Scotia-Fundy <b>mobile</b> <b>gear</b> fishery. Individual transferable vessel quotas were introduced for the 1991 fishing season for the three main species: cod, haddock and pollock. Using individual vessel data a restricted normalized quadratic profit function is used in estimation. The quadratic form is used here because of the ease of imposing regularity conditions. The model is specified imposing no restrictions on economies of scale but using an instrumental variable technique to account for possible correlation of fixed output levels with the residuals prior to 1991. Vessels are assumed to minimise the cost of harvesting quota regulated species and maximise profits over unregulated landings. The shadow value is measured as the value to the vessel of an increase in quota holdings. This includes a change in non-quota restricted profit caused by an increase in marginal cost from a one unit increase in quota landings, and a change in restricted profit due to the substitute/complementary relationship between non-quota and quota landings. The shadow value to the vessel is the price of quota fish minus the change in restricted profit. Changing regulatory polices will impact the value that fishers place on quota and knowledge of this value will allow regulators to identify types of transactions that might take place. Because shadow values are conditioned upon other quota holdings, fishery managers can influence the value fishers place on quota by changes in other quota holdings...|$|R

The main aim of the closure is to protect and enhance biodiversity and so {{the aim of the}} study was to quantify the response of nekton and use these measures to assess if the closure was working at meeting its objective. Surveys were conducted in similar habitats during both spring and summer using Baited Remote Underwater Video. Footage was analysed and data extracted was used to get measures of abundance of all mobile taxa, abundance of commercially fished species, abundance of scavengers, {{species richness}} and diversity. These response variables were analysed using both Analysis of Variance and Multivariate Analysis to determine both temporal and spatial differences in three treatments which allowed for a more detailed investigation of assemblage composition. Results showed that in line with its main objective, diversity had significantly increased within the closure between 2009 and 2010. It was also confirmed that seasonality was an influencing factor on the response variables and assemblage composition. It was found that abundance of scavengers was significantly higher in the areas still fished using <b>mobile</b> fishing <b>gear</b> which is similar to many other studies on marine protected areas that. Interestingly although there was no significant increase in abundance within the closure between 2009 and 2010 there was a significant increase in the abundance of commercially fished species. The closure in Lyme Bay was not established for enhancement of commercial fisheries; however it appears based on two years data that this is occurring as a consequence of the gear restriction. One point to note is that although habitat was taken into consideration in the experimental design, the analysis of data showed that site was a strong influencing factor on the response variables. In most cases the effects of site were so significant it masked any effect of treatment being apparent and so it is suggested that future work is carried out looking at relationships between response variables or specific species of interest and environmental factorsFaculty of Scienc...|$|R

This protocol is based solely on Elliptic curve asymmetric cryptography and the results prove that the performance achieved is good compared to RSA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. — The {{increasing}} {{concern about}} impacts of bottom trawling, scallop dredging, and other mobile fishing methods has {{focused primarily on}} effects on commercial fisheries, but these fishing activities also act more broadly on benthic biological diversity. Because the seabed is erroneously envisioned as a featureless, nearly lifeless plain, impacts of commercial fishing gear have long been underestimated. Structures on and in the seabed, including biogenic structures (reef corals, kelp hold fasts, shells, tubes, and tunnels), create a diversity of habitat patches. They provide refuges from predation and feeding places for demersal fishes and other species. Benthic structural complexity is positively correlated with species diversity and postsettlement survivorship of some commercial fishes. <b>Mobile</b> fishing <b>gear</b> disturbs the seabed, damaging benthic structures and harming structure-associ ated species, including commercially important fishes, although some other commercial fish species can persist where seabed structures have been removed. Bottom trawling is therefore similar to forest clear-cutting, but {{it is far more}} extensive and is converting very large areas of formerly structurally complex, biologically diverse seabed into the marine equivalent of low-diversity cattle pasture. In contrast with the U. S. National Forest Management Act, which governs use of living resources in federally owned forestlands, the 1996 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Ac...|$|R

On the other hand, a growing demand for <b>mobile</b> devices has <b>geared</b> a shift towards mobile e-commerce applications. This paper highlights that the existing authentication protocols, based on RSA asymmetric cryptography, are not appropriate for such devices due to their limitations in computing power, memory capacity, key sizes and cryptographic support. Therefore, an efficient protocol for resource constrained platforms that achieve a level of security {{similar to the one}} achieved by the protocols in use today is designed and implemented. This protocol is based solely on Hyperelliptic curve asymmetric cryptography and the results prove that the performance achieved is good compared to RSA.
