30|$|The methods {{presented}} in this paper are simple tools that allow constraining the geometrical parameters of the vent during an eruption, provided that a video of adequate quality can be obtained. They can be easily automated by applying clast tracking software, like that of Gaudin et al. (2014). This means that if an eruption is monitored by a camera and videos are processed in near real-time, the (inner) vent radius r as well as the depth level z of emitted ash pulses could be assessed. The importance of these input parameters for any models of mass flux, including plume models, has been mentioned above. In addition, it is worth considering that they are also essential to monitoring techniques such as infrasound sensing. Infrasound interpretation depends on a robust estimate of the effective vent radius (Ripepe et al. 2013). Hence, the methods presented here would be a useful complement to any real-time <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>system</b> that constrains the mass eruption rate, which is the main source parameter influencing ash plume formation and higher-up atmospheric circulation.|$|E

These analyses provide a detailed case study of environmental pollution by asbestos fibers at low levels. The levels of total fibers with a length greater than 3 mm, measured with a real time fiber analyser monitor (FAM), give a baseline of 2. 5 fibers per l., throughout the duration of sampling. The same levels, calculated during periods of eective presence of sta, are smaller than 10 fb per l.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complex <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>system</b> of destruction of organic material on the surface of Mars, step-by-step laboratory simulations of processes occurring on the surface of Mars are necessary. This paper describes the measured effects of two parameters, a CO 2 atmosphere and low temperature, on the destruction rate of amino acids when irradiated with Mars-like ultraviolet light (UV). The results show that the presence of a 7 mbar CO 2 atmosphere does not affect the destruction rate of glycine, and that cooling the sample to 210 K (average Mars temperature) lowers the destruction rate by a factor of 7. The decrease in the destruction rate of glycine by cooling the sample is thought to be predominantly caused by the slower reaction kinetics. When these results are scaled to Martian lighting conditions, cold thin films of glycine are assumed to have half-lives of 250 h under noontime peak illumination. It has been hypothesised that the absence of detectable native organic material in the Martian regolith points to the presence of oxidising agents. Some of these agents might form via the interaction of UV with compounds in the atmosphere. Water, although a trace component of Mars’ atmosphere, is suggested to be a significant source of oxidising species. However, gaseous CO 2 or adsorbed H 2 O layers do not influence the photodestruction of amino acids significantly in the absence of reactive soil. Other mechanisms such as chemical processes in the Martian regolith need to be effective for rapid organic destruction. <br/...|$|E

In the course of studying possible ways of integration in SES and subsequent processes of formation of synergistic potentials, it is noted that these processes are based on the establishment of rational (optimal) connectivity between the structures and functions of SES. Obviously, if the connectivity in the system is zero, then there is no interaction between its elements or subsystems, integration is excluded, and there is no positive synergetic effect, or, most likely, it is negative. Due to the non-additivity of the properties of the elements of the SES system, it is studied as an integrated formation based on the analysis of the connectivity of its constituent elements –potentials (production, organizational, innovation, infrastructure, personnel, financial, information, consumer, status), and each component of the potential is subject to the action of not only general, but also their own specific laws and trends of development and has its own specific essence. It is established that this connectivity, determined on the basis of expert assessments, forms a matrix in which each element reflects a possible partial synergetic effect, and the entire matrix as a whole reflects the integral synergetic effect arising in the SES, which has some optimal value.

The research extends the methods of numerical bifurcation analysis to address issues specific to the aerospace sector.

40|$|The {{challenge}} on {{implementation of}} the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) fosters {{the development of new}} monitoring methods and approaches. It is now commonly accepted that the use of classical monitoring campaigns in discrete point is not sufficient to fully assess and describe a water body. Due to this the WFD promote the use of modelling techniques in surface waters to assist all phases of the process, from characterisation and establishment of reference conditions to identification of pressures and assessment of impact. The work presented in this communication is based on these principles. A classical monitoring of the water status of the main transitional water bodies of Algarve (south of Portugal) is combined with advanced in situ water profiling and hydrodynamic, water quality and ecological modelling of the systems to build a complete description of its state. This approach extends spatially and temporally the resolution of the classical point sampling. The methodology was applied during a 12 month program in Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, the Guadiana estuary and the Arade estuary. The synoptic profiling uses an YSI 6600 EDS <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>system</b> attached to a boat and a GPS receiver to produce monthly synoptic maps of the systems. This data extends the discrete point sampling with laboratory analysis performed monthly in several points of each water body. The point sampling is used to calibrate the profiling system and to include variables, such as nutrients, not measured by the sensors. A total of 1427 samplings were performed for physical and chemical parameters, chlorophyll and microbiologic contamination in the water column.

40|$|Monitoring {{of coastal}} and estuarine water quality has been {{traditionally}} performed by sampling with subsequent laboratory analysis. This has the disadvantages of low {{spatial and temporal}} resolution and high cost. In the last decades two alternative techniques have emerged to overcome this drawback: profiling and remote sensing. Profiling using multi-parameter sensors {{is now in a}} commercial stage. It can be used, tied to a boat, to obtain a quick “picture” of the system. The spatial resolution thus increases from single points to a line coincident with the boat track. The temporal resolution however remains unchanged since campaigns and resources involved are basically the same. The need for laboratory analysis was reduced but not eliminated because parameters like nutrients, microbiology or metals are still difficult to obtain with sensors and validation measurements are still needed. In the last years the improvement in satellite resolution has enabled its use for coastal and estuarine water monitoring. Although spatial coverage and resolution of satellite images in the present is already suitable to coastal and estuarine monitoring, temporal resolution is naturally limited to satellite passages and cloud cover. With this panorama the best approach to water monitoring is to integrate and combine data from all these sources. The natural tools to perform this integration are numerical models. Models benefit from the different sources of data to obtain a better calibration. After calibration they can be used to extend spatially and temporally the methods resolution. In Algarve (South of Portugal) a monitoring effort using this approach is being undertaken. The monitoring effort comprises five different locations including coastal waters, estuaries and coastal lagoons.

This solution mine is located in the Lorraine salt basin, at Cerville-Buissoncourt southwards from Nancy, France. To monitor the cavern collapse, a permanent monitoring system was set up. This comprises a SYTGEM <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>system</b> featuring high resolution microseismic (5 1 D geophones, 4 3 D geophones, 40 - 1000 Hz) linked to ground surface monitoring (tacheometer and GPS high resolution measurements). The important amount of data transmitted for on-line processing offered daily insight of the evolution of the geological system. The early signs of unstable evolution were detected by high resolution microseismic monitoring during spring 2008 : a shift in microseismic background regime as well as recurrent microseismic episodes were associated to a general process of rock failure due to the cavern growing upwards. This was accompanied by a few episodes of massive roof falls, with no ground surface movement detected. During a second and last stage of evolution that lasted three days, the cavern collapse was triggered by brine pumping. Three main microseismic regimes were then observed, each being well correlated with changes in both the surface subsidence rate and the brine level in the cavern. The first peak of activity, due again to massive roof falls below the Beaumont dolomite bed, also initiated the brittle rupture of this bed. The second and major peak of activity marked its rapid and energetic failure; it also corresponded to an acceleration in the subsidence rate. The last peak of activity, a few hours later, weaker in terms of number of events and energy released, signed the final collapse. The complete dataset confirms the major role of the Beaumont dolomite bed in the site stability. Besides, if the preliminary analysis of the microseismicity patterns right before the general collapse, confirms that the acceleration in the microseismic activity follows a power law, it also shows that the b-value is a complex marker in such context. Even though local falls of b-value well correlate, as expected, to local increases in microseismic energy release, it seems inappropriate to use it for forecasting purposes: over a short period of time, several b-value decreases are observed while a continuous pumping regime is applied to the system. So, apparent b-value variations don't show clear precursory pattern, as observed in other case-study. Nevertheless, further investigations over the different stages of evolution of the cavern, including the collapse period, are needed to confirm this preliminary result...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic digestion, {{which is}} {{the process by which}} {{bacteria}} breakdown organic matter to produce biogas (renewable energy source) and digestate (biofertiliser) in the absence of oxygen, proves to be the ideal concept not only for sustainable energy provision but also for effective organic waste management. However, the production amount of biogas {{to keep up with the}} global demand is limited by the underperformance in the system implementing the AD process. This underperformance is due to the difficulty in obtaining and maintaining the optimal operating parameters/states for anaerobic bacteria to thrive with regards to attaining a specific critical population number, which results in maximising the biogas production. This problem continues to exist as a result of insufficient knowledge of the interactions between the operating parameters and bacterial community. In addition, the lack of sufficient knowledge of the composition of bacterial groups that varies with changes in the operating parameters such as temperature, substrate and retention time. Without sufficient knowledge of the overall impact of the physico-environmental operating parameters on anaerobic bacterial growth and composition, significant improvement of biogas production may be difficult to attain. In order to mitigate this problem, this study has presented a nonlinear <b>multi-parameter</b> <b>system</b> modelling of mesophilic AD. It utilised raw data sets generated from laboratory experimentation of the influence of four operating parameters, temperature, pH, mixing speed and pressure on biogas and methane production, signifying that this is a multiple input single output (MISO) system. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of the data, the nonlinear black-box modelling technique is applied. The modelling is performed in MATLAB through System Identification approach. Two nonlinear model structures, autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) and Hammerstein-Wiener (NLHW) with different nonlinearity estimators and model orders are chosen by trial and error and utilised to estimate the models. The performance of the models is determined by comparing the simulated outputs of the estimated models and the output in the validation data. The approach is used to validate the estimated models by checking how well the simulated output of the models fits the measured output. The best models for biogas and methane production are chosen by comparing the outputs of the best NARX and NLHW models (each for biogas and methane production), and the validation data, as well as utilising the Akaike information criterion to measure the quality of each model relative to each of the other models. The NLHW models mhw 2 and mhws 2 are chosen for biogas and methane production, respectively. The identified NLHW models mhw 2 and mhws 2 represent the behaviour of the production of biogas and methane, respectively, from mesophilic AD. Among all the candidate models studied, the nonlinear models provide a superior reproduction of the experimental data over the whole analysed period. Furthermore, the models constructed in this study cannot be used for scale-up purpose because they are not able to satisfy the rules and criteria for applying dimensional analysis to scale-up...|$|E

40|$|A <b>multi-parameter</b> sensor <b>system</b> for the {{detection}} of eight (bio-) chemical and physical parameters (pH, potassium concentration, penicillin concentration, diffusion coefficient of H+- and OH [...] ions, temperature, flow velocity, flow direction and liquid leve,) is realized by using the same transducer principle. A Ta 2 O 5 -gate ISFET (ion-sensitive field-effect transistor) is applied as basic transducer for all kinds of sensors. The multi-parameter detection is achieved by means of sequentially or simultaneously scheduling of the hybride sensor modules consisting of four ISFET structures and an ion generator in different sensor arrangements and/or different operation modes. Thus, more parameters (eight) can be detected :ban the number of sensors (four) in the system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe present gas sensor devices {{based on}} nanocrystalline SnO 2 films, which are {{integrated}} on CMOS fabricated micro-hotplate (μhp) chips. Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) such as PdAu, PtAu, and PdPt have been synthesized for optimizing the sensing performance of these sensors. We demonstrate that proper functionalization with PdAu-NPs {{leads to a}} strongly improved sensitivity to the toxic gas carbon monoxide while the cross sensitivity to humidity and carbon dioxide is almost completely suppressed, which is of high importance for real life environmental conditions. We also present μhp chips employing Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) technology, which are capable for flexible 3 D-integration {{of different types of}} gas sensors to a <b>multi-parameter</b> nanosensor <b>system.</b> Such CMOS integrated systems are promising candidates for realizing smart sensor devices for consumer market applications...|$|R

The integrated system enables on-chip measurement, analysis and determination of flow and several physical properties of both gases and liquids.

40|$|A <b>multi-parameter</b> {{measurement}} <b>system</b> {{was designed}} and built to process signals from acoustic emis-sion (AE) transducers in real time. The system makes selected measurements of each detected AE event as it occurs and stores 23 measured parameters which describe that event in digital form on a standard diskette with IBM format. Measurements recorded on the diskette include information on the shape, mag-nitude, and frequency content of each AE burst, its timing with respect to location on the specimen under test and its timing with respect to load conditions, pressure, test time, and event count. Over 8000 AE events can be stored on a s~ngle diskette at a maximum instantaneous rate. of 6000 events/sec and a maximum average rate of 1000 events/sec. Two floppy disk units {{are included in the}} system so one ca...|$|R
40|$|MEMS {{are usually}} {{designed}} for measuring one parameter and on-chip co-integration of sensor (microstructure) and readout circuits is often pursued. In a <b>multi-parameter</b> measurement <b>system,</b> yield considerations and fabrication compatibility problems favor micro-instruments based on active Si-MCM techniques. The generic device {{is based on}} a stacked structure with a universally applicable active silicon MCM platform that contains all the infrastructural functions of a measurement system. Customizing the microsystem requires flip-chip attach of sensor dies and a commercially available microcontroller die, which is subsequently programmed for the intended application. The micro-instrument features a data pre processing capability to provide high-level data (e. g. spectral information rather than raw sensor data) and to communicate with a host processor intelligently.

Analysis of data at different angles gives relative emission strengths. This method helps to clearly distinguish triplet decay events from the intense nearby 511 keV emission.

This domain is calculated through a guardian map which involves the determinant of the Kronecker sum of a matrix with itself. The stability domain is synthesized for both single and <b>multi-parameter</b> dependent LTI <b>systems.</b> The single parameter case is easily computable, whereas the multi-parameter case is more involved. The determinant of the bialternate sum of a matrix with itself is also exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the results. ...|$|R
40|$|Early warning systems (EWS) {{applied to}} geohazards and {{landslides}} should rely increasingly on cutting edge <b>multi-parameter</b> monitoring <b>systems.</b> These aim to provide both the best insight in the physics and then reach {{the best time}} delay required by decision makers. In addition, monitoring geohazard on the long term is becoming an increasingly multi-stakeholder process, involving various interacting actors with different roles. Seamless access to dataset, easy-to-read advanced results and technical information of interest to be shared between numerous actors is becoming all the more important. Then, {{in the same manner}} as in the computing field, cloud monitoring technologies and solutions may pace rapidly the next generation of monitoring services. The paper intends to give a brief overview of this prospect, focusing on recent information technology breakthroughs and considerations on the cost benefit of such a network centric approach.
