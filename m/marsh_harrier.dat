5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier,</b> Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{continues}} broadly northwards {{to reach}} Ebridge lock and mill, passing the former dyke to the hamlet of Meeting House Hill on its western bank. Although {{there was no}} public access to this stretch in 2014, there are plans for a footpath between the two locks to be created. Above Ebridge lock, the mill pond has been dredged and the banks cleared, to create a large expanse of open water. Wildlife has benefitted, with sightings of water voles, otters, reed warblers, dragonflies, kingfishers, wood sandpipers and a <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> being recorded. A canalside footpath provides access to the water.|$|E
40|$|Loop {{migration}} among birds {{is characterized}} by the spring route lying consistently west or east of the autumn route. The existence of loops has been explained by general wind conditions or seasonal differences in habitat distribution. Loop migration has predominantly been studied at the population level, for example by analysing ring recoveries. Here we study loop migration of individual <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> Circus aeruginosus tracked by satellite telemetry. We show that despite a generally narrow migration corridor the harriers travelled in a distinct clockwise loop through Africa and southern Europe, following more westerly routes in spring than in autumn. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify potential feeding habitat in Africa. Suitable habitat seemed always more abundant along the western route, both in spring and autumn, and no important stopover site was found along the eastern route. Observed routes did thus not coincide with seasonal variation in habitat availability. However, favourable habitat might be more important during spring migration, when the crossing of the Sahara seems more challenging, and thus habitat availability might play an indirect role in the harriers' route choice. Grid-based wind data were used to reconstruct general wind patterns, and in qualitative agreement with the observed loop <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> predominantly encountered westerly winds in Europe and easterly winds in Africa, both in autumn and in spring. By correlating tail- and crosswinds with forward and perpendicular movement rates, respectively, we show that <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are partially drifted by wind. Thus, we tentatively conclude that wind rather than habitat seems to have an overriding effect on the shape of the migration routes of <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers.</b> General wind conditions seem {{to play an important role}} also in the evolution of narrow migratory loops as demonstrated for individual <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers...</b>|$|R

40|$|We tracked three {{juvenile}} and 14 adult <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> Circus aeruginosus {{from southern}} Sweden via satellite to investigate migration strategies. Four individuals were tracked {{for at least}} two years. All three juveniles and four of the adults made west-oriented pre-migratory movements well before the onset of autumn migration, and trans-Saharan migrants visited post-migratory stopover areas in tropical Africa. By these movements, the harriers presumably exploit short-term regional variation in food abundance. Autumn and spring migration occurred in a relatively narrow corridor, without distinct differences between sexes in timing, speed, distance, and duration of migration, except that females tended to migrate faster in spring than did males. Juveniles migrated shorter distances than adults, and migration speeds were lower. Spring migration was similar to autumn migration in terms of speed and duration. Juveniles did not cross the Sahara Desert and three birds, one female and two juveniles, wintered in Europe, which is in accordance with a recent {{increase in the number of}} (juvenile) <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> wintering in northwestern Europe. All birds that crossed the Sahara wintered in tropical West Africa. Harriers showed site fidelity to breeding, wintering and stopover areas. The overall migration speed of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> was similar to that of Ospreys Pandion haliaetus and Honey Buzzards Pernis apivorus, two other trans-Saharan migrants. Ospreys use fly-and-forage migration to promote resulting speed, whereas Honey Buzzards are particularly apt to exploit thermal soaring. How <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> balance foraging versus travelling to accomplish their rapid migration speeds remains to be resolved...|$|R
25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, {{and if he is}} always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments.

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier,</b> and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{two species}} were generally recognized: the <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus) and the African <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. ranivorus). The <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> is now usually split into several species, sometimes {{as many as}} six. These are the western <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. aeruginosus), eastern <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. spilonotus), Papuan harrier (C. spilonotus spilothorax or C. spilothorax), swamp harrier (C. approximans), Réunion harrier (C. maillardi maillardi or C. maillardi) and Madagascar <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> (C. maillardi macrosceles or C. macrosceles).|$|E
50|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are {{birds of}} prey of the harrier subfamily. They are {{medium-sized}} raptors and the largest and broadest-winged harriers. Most of them are associated with marshland and dense reedbeds. They are found almost worldwide, excluding only the Americas.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the other}} <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers,</b> it is {{strongly}} associated with wetland areas, especially those rich in common reed (Phragmites australis). It can also be met with {{in a variety of}} other open habitats, such as farmland and grassland, particularly where these border marshland. It is a territorial bird in the breeding season, and even in winter it seems less social than other harriers, which often gather in large flocks. But this is probably simply due to habitat preferences, as the <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are completely allopatric while several of C. aeruginosus grassland and steppe relatives winter in the same regions and assemble at food sources such as locust outbreaks. Still, in Keoladeo National Park of Rajasthan (India) around 100 Eurasian <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are observed to roost together each November/December; they assemble in tall grassland dominated by Desmostachya bipinnata and vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides), but where this is too disturbed by human activity they will use floating carpets of common water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) instead - the choice of such roost sites may be to give early warning of predators, which will conspicuously rustle through the plants if they try to sneak upon the resting birds ...|$|R
