40|$|AbstractTraffic sign {{readability}} can {{be affected}} by the existence of dirt on traffic sign faces. However, among damaged signs, dirty traffic signs are unique since their damage is not permanent and they just can be cleaned instead of replaced. This study aimed to identify the most important factors contributing to traffic sign dirt. To do so, a large number of traffic signs in Utah were measured by deploying a vehicle instrumented with mobile LiDAR imaging and digital photolog technologies. Each individual daytime digital image was inspected for dirt. Location and climate observations obtained from official sources were compiled using ArcGIS throughout the process. To identify contributing factors to traffic sign dirt, the chi-square test was employed. To analyze the data and rank all of the factors based on their importance to the sign dirt, Random forests statistical model was utilized. After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that ground elevation, sign <b>mount</b> <b>height,</b> and air pollution had the highest effect on making traffic signs dirty. The findings of this investigation assist transportation agencies in determining traffic signs with a higher likelihood of sign dirt. In this way, agencies would schedule to clean such traffic signs more frequently...|$|E

While usefulness {{of this research is}} hoped result it can be used as consideration and reference for breeder to fulfilling requirement of obtained livestock nutrisi from elephant grass at height of different place, and also upon which information for research hereinafter. The material that are used were elephant grass sample of age between 45 until 60 days, as according to the information from elephant grass’s farmer which got at height of different place. The height level divide into 3 of land, namely hight land, midle land, an low land. Every land taken 2 village, while every village taken 4 sample of elephant grass from the different location. Attempt method in this research were survey and interview, by using the pattem or Nested Classification three level. If there are marked difference among treating, so conducted by a smallest different test (BNT). Result this research indicate that moun, place height have an effect non significant (P> 0, 05) to content of elephant grass dry mater, while among village in height have an effect on verry real (P 0, 05) to harsh fibre content of elephant grass. <b>Mount</b> <b>height</b> of place and between village in height have an effect on non significant (P> 0, 05) to dusty content of elephant grass. The Conclusion of this research is content of nutrisi elephant grass which good to feed of livestock at dry season is elephant grass which coming from middle land or low land, because dry materials content from each plain relative much the same to, but harsh fibre content at highest plateau, so that if high harsh fibre will difficult digested by livestock.

40|$|This {{nighttime}} {{field study}} addressed the relative visibility of retroreflective pavement markings from trucks and cars. To do that, both low-beam headlamp <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> and observer eye height were varied. The task involved detecting {{the presence of}} a strip of retroreflective pavement marking that was moved towards a stationary observer. The main finding is that headlamp <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> had a statistically significant effect on detection distance. Increasing the <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> from the lowest tested level (0. 6 m) to the highest tested level (1. 2 m) resulted in a 19 % increase in detection distance. On the other hand, there was no effect of eye height over the range tested (1. 2 m to 2. 4 m). Because truck headlamps are generally mounted higher than car headlamps, the present findings imply that retroreflective pavement markings are more visible (and thus more effective) for truck drivers than car drivers. Furthermore, these findings are in support of higher headlamp <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> for all types of vehicles. However, higher headlamp <b>mounting</b> <b>heights</b> lead to more glare for both oncoming drivers and preceding drivers via rearview mirrors. Consequently, determining an optimal headlamp <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> would require a complex weighing of both visibility and glare considerations...|$|R

40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} the effects of <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> on discomfort glare from reduced-power high-beam headlamps used as automotive daytime running lamps. Of interest were the effects for <b>mounting</b> <b>heights</b> between 0. 864 m (34 in) and 1. 372 m (54 in) - the range in which full-power low beams are currently allowed, but reduced-power high beams are not. Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power high beams with that from full-power low beams. The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power high beams as a function of increased <b>mounting</b> <b>height.</b> The analyses were based on photometric information from five high beams and 43 low beams from lamps manufactured for the United States market. They were performed for five following distances and three lateral offsets of the vehicles. The results indicate that allowing reduced-power high beams with <b>mounting</b> <b>heights</b> between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power high beams at a <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power low beams...|$|R

Variable rate fertilization requires quantification of grass growth level. Objective {{of this study}} was to compare the performance of potential sensors under different growth levels and sensor operation conditions. A CCD camera, an ultrasonic module, and an optical reflectance sensor (i. e., Crop Circle) were tested at fields with different grass growth levels. Effects of sensor <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> and angle were investigated. Effects of vehicle (i. e., mower tractor) vibration and traveling were also investigated: under static, vibration and no traveling, and vibration with traveling conditions. Results showed that sensor <b>mounting</b> <b>height</b> had a little effect on the sensor performance, and grass growth level was successfully quantified. Camera angle of 90 ° showed the best performance with less noise. The ultrasonic sensor could work with less deviation under static condition, whereas, CCD camera proved the applicability under all operating conditions. Operation condition of the optical reflectance sensor showed a little effect on the grass growth detection results. This study would provide information useful for automated grass growth mapping and variable fertilization recommendation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA bifacial {{photovoltaic}} {{model was}} developed {{not only to}} calculate the power and energy yield for bifacial modules for various setup and installation conditions but also to identify suitable bifacial module applications and markets. The bifacial model shows that the energy yield for bifacial modules is very much location dependent and hugely influenced by how they are setup and installed. There {{is a need to}} have the modules mounted at a certain elevation above the ground to gain maximum energy yield. It is also important to ensure there is no blockage for the direct sun to shine on the area directly beneath the module. For locations at low latitude, a higher elevation is required. For locations at high latitude, the probability of the direct sunlight reaching the ground directly under the module is higher. Therefore, less module mounting elevation is required. However, there is a saturation point for energy yield improvement with increased module <b>mounting</b> <b>height.</b> In addition to the <b>mounting</b> <b>height,</b> a sufficient length of clearance path in front of the module array should be considered. The model also shows that the ground reflectance {{is one of the key}} parameters for bifacial module performance. The model indicates that > 10 % of energy yield gain with 20 % background reflectance from REC bifacial multi-crystalline silicon solar module array with a bifaciality of 0. 6 is achievable in Konstanz, Germany. This correlates well with the measured field energy yield data of the bifacial prototype modules...|$|R
