2500|$|A {{variation}} of front crawl {{often used in}} training involves only one arm moving at any one time, while the other arm rests and is stretched out at the front. This style is called a [...] "catch up" [...] stroke because the <b>moving</b> <b>hand</b> touches, or [...] "catches up" [...] to the stationary one before the stationary hand begins its motion. Catch up requires more strength for swimming because the hand is beginning the pull from a stationary position rather than a dynamic one. This style is slower than the regular front crawl and is rarely used competitively; however, it is often used for training purposes by swimmers, as it increases the body's awareness of being streamlined in the water. Total Immersion is a similar technique.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{monitoring}} {{system that can}} distinguish the normal behavior from abnormal ones based on trajectory of palm for supermarket is designed. Our system brings some traditional algorithms and insights together to construct a framework for a new field called Supermarket Monitoring. In this project, only the <b>moving</b> <b>hands</b> are considered. To fulfill the automated monitoring task, the self-adaptive background subtraction technique and the YIQ skin color model are combined to detect the <b>moving</b> <b>hands.</b> In order to accurate localization at palm, a new method is developed. After successfully detecting the <b>moving</b> <b>hands,</b> a linear prediction model is cited to realize the object tracking. The Self-Organizing Map is used to distinguish normal behavior from abnormal ones by analyzing the trajectory characterizations of the <b>moving</b> <b>hands.</b> The experiment results show that this system is robust and effective...|$|R

5000|$|... "Analog" [...] {{indicates}} {{something that}} is mathematically represented {{by a set of}} continuous values; for example, the analog clock uses constantly <b>moving</b> <b>hands</b> on a physical clock face, where <b>moving</b> the <b>hands</b> directly alters the information that clock is providing. Thus, an analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage, current or charge changes (compare with digital signals below). Analog signal processing (ASP) then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via various electrical means.|$|R

60|$|The {{ease and}} grace {{with which the}} maidens of the valley {{propelled}} themselves through the water, and their familiarity with the element, were truly astonishing.

60|$|Such {{was life}} at Mrs Pipchin's. On Saturday Mr Dombey came down; and Florence and Paul {{would go to}} his Hotel, and have tea They passed the whole of Sunday with him, and {{generally}} rode out before dinner; and on these occasions Mr Dombey seemed to grow, like Falstaff's assailants, and instead of being one man in buckram, to become a dozen. Sunday evening was the most melancholy evening in the week; for Mrs Pipchin always {{made a point of}} being particularly cross on Sunday nights. Miss Pankey was generally brought back from an aunt's at Rottingdean, in deep distress; and Master Bitherstone, whose relatives were all in India, and who was required to sit, between the services, in an erect position with his head against the parlour wall, neither <b>moving</b> <b>hand</b> nor foot, suffered so acutely in his young spirits that he once asked Florence, on a Sunday night, if she could give him any idea of the way back to Bengal.|$|E

Higher notes are played by <b>moving</b> the <b>hand</b> closer to the pitch antenna. Louder notes are played by <b>moving</b> the <b>hand</b> away from the volume antenna.|$|R

6000|$|Contemplating {{its great}} girth--crinkled {{and a little}} mossed, but not yet hollow--he would {{speculate}} on the passage of time. That tree had seen, perhaps, all real English history; it dated, he shouldn't wonder, {{from the days of}} Elizabeth at least. His own fifty years were as nothing to its wood. When the house behind it, which he now owned, was three hundred years of age instead of twelve, that tree might still be standing there, vast and hollow--for who would commit such sacrilege as to cut it down? A Forsyte might perhaps still be living in that house, to guard it jealously. And Jolyon would wonder what the house would look like coated with such age. Wistaria was already about its walls--the new look had gone. Would it hold its own and keep the dignity Bosinney had bestowed on it, or would the giant London have lapped it round and made it into an asylum {{in the midst of a}} jerry-built wilderness? Often, within and without of it, he was persuaded that Bosinney had been moved by the spirit when he built. He had put his heart into that house, indeed! It might even become one of the 'homes of England'--a rare achievement for a house in these degenerate days of building. And the aesthetic spirit, <b>moving</b> <b>hand</b> in hand with his Forsyte sense of possessive continuity, dwelt with pride and pleasure on his ownership thereof. There was the smack of reverence and ancestor-worship (if only for one ancestor) in his desire to hand this house down to his son and his son's son. His father had loved the house, had loved the view, the grounds, that tree; his last years had been happy there, and no one had lived there before him. These last eleven years at Robin Hill had formed in Jolyon's life as a painter, the important period of success. He was now in the very van of water-colour art, hanging on the line everywhere. His drawings fetched high prices. Specialising in that one medium with the tenacity of his breed, he had 'arrived'--rather late, but not too late for a member of the family which made a point of living for ever. His art had really deepened and improved. In conformity with his position he had grown a short fair beard, which was just beginning to grizzle, and hid his Forsyte chin; his brown face had lost the warped expression of his ostracised period--he looked, if anything, younger. The loss of his wife in 1894 had been one of those domestic tragedies which turn out in the end for the good of all. He had, indeed, loved her to the last, for his was an affectionate spirit, but she had become increasingly difficult: jealous of her step-daughter June, jealous even of her own little daughter Holly, and making ceaseless plaint that he could not love her, ill as she was, and 'useless to everyone, and better dead.' He had mourned her sincerely, but his face had looked younger since she died. If she could only have believed that she made him happy, how much happier would the twenty years of their companionship have been! ...|$|E
