30|$|This paper {{presented}} the LogDrive framework {{to mitigate the}} following problems of storage forensics in IaaS cloud environments: (1) volatility of virtual block storage and difficulty in imaging the physical drives in cloud data centers, (2) increasing volume of forensic data, and (3) anti-forensic attacks that hide traces of attacks in virtual machines. The LogDrive framework provides a proactive {{data collection and analysis}} function for mitigating these three problems. We employed a log-structured design to archive all written sectors to mitigate problems (1) and (3) and the sector-hash-based file detection method with random sampling to <b>mitigate</b> <b>problem</b> (2). This {{paper presented}} the problem formulation, the investigative context, the design with five new algorithms, the implementation process, and the performance evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Background Globally, two in five {{children}} are deemed vulnerable {{by virtue of}} their physical, psychological and social characteristics. These children are at increased risk of sub-optimal care and disproportionate levels of iatrogenic harm. There remains a paucity of literature describing initiatives for practice improvement for these children. Objectives Identify safety reports describing vulnerable children in the England and Wales National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). Characterise reports in terms of what happened and reported causative issues, in order to identify key change concepts (drivers) and related interventions (change ideas) for improvement. Methods An operational definition of ‘vulnerability in children’, including key domains and related keywords (Appendix 1, 2), was empirically informed by a scoping review of the published and grey literature. Relevant reports were descriptively analysed. The free text of the four most frequent incident types (Pareto principle) was discussed by a multi-disciplinary team to identify key concepts for improvement. Results 2, 015 reports were identified involving vulnerable children. The problem areas identified primarily resulted from a fragmentation of care services. This included inefficient transfer of information between primary care services; failure to operationalise care plans in practice; and inconsistent access to healthcare services. Reported causes are outlined in an Ishikawa diagram (figure 1) and summarized in the related driver diagram (figure 2) to <b>mitigate</b> <b>problem</b> areas. Conclusions Analysis of patient safety incident reports assisted in the pragmatic identification of key concepts for healthcare professionals to begin more informed discussions about improving the care delivered to vulnerable childre...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{environment}} that a spacecraft will experience during a launch is unknown until a full coupled loads analysis (CLA) has been {{performed by the}} launch vehicle contractor. By the time this has been done, the small satellite provider might {{not have time to}} <b>mitigate</b> <b>problem</b> areas by redesigning component mounts or alternatively installing isolating mounts. Unmitigated loads issues could increase the risk of failure of not only a component, but of the entire mission. This current process of mission planning is costly and inefficient. A better approach is to have coupled loads analysis data available for real spacecraft of various sizes on multiple launch vehicles in order to know what the expected environment will be for a particular spacecraft and launch vehicle combination. To further ensure that any unknown vehicle loads will not be detrimental to the spacecraft, the installation of a SoftRide wholespacecraft isolation system can reduce the transmitted loads. This is the approach currently under study for the Office of Responsive Space (ORS) by CSA Engineering whereby many small spacecraft (less than 1500 lbs) are being analyzed on five separate launch vehicles and key spacecraft responses are being tracked. These responses will drive the creation of a small set of SoftRide “sizes” which can be premanufactured and stored on-the-shelf in anticipation of any upcoming launch. A software tool will be able to identify the expected loads on the spacecraft and the correct size SoftRide for the mission when a user enters information about the payload into a database which contains results from the entire set of generic payload analyses. This analysis and implementation methodology is being developed for ORS to help their need for a quick satellite launch aboard any available launch vehicle (LV) with only a few weeks notification. ORS’s needs can be a benefit to all small payloads because of the large loads database which can provide insight into a launch vehicle’s environment (using SoftRide) for spacecraft design purposes...|$|E
