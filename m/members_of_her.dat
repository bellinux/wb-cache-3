5|$|Later, some of {{the workers}} complained to a cleric that Noreen insulted Muhammad. What they accused her of saying, which would be stated in the later court verdict, differs from her version. A mob came to her house, beating her and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family before she was rescued by the police. The police {{initiated}} an investigation about her remarks, resulting in her arrest under Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Although the set was plagued by a late arrival and problems with her voice, the crowd warmed to her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers.

5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, {{the victim of a}} severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00a.m. on May 25.

The Countess was {{with him when he}} died unexpectedly, possibly of malaria, on 4 September 1588 at Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire; they had been on their way to Kenilworth and Buxton. The Earl's funeral at Warwick in October 1588 was attended by his widow as well as numerous <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family circle.|$|E
5|$|The damage inflicted {{during the}} attack was not {{sufficient}} to sink or disable Tirpitz, but she suffered considerable damage to her superstructure and unarmored areas, with 122 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew killed and 316 were wounded. The German Kriegsmarine decided to repair the battleship, and works were completed by mid-July. The British conducted further carrier raids against Tirpitz between April and August 1944 {{in the hope of}} prolonging the period she was out of service, but none was successful. Tirpitz was eventually disabled and then sunk by Royal Air Force heavy bombers in late 1944.|$|E
5|$|While Miller toured Europe {{and lived}} out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron's tomb, Coolbrith was saddled with {{custody of her}} daughter, and the care of <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own family, so she set up house a in Oakland and {{accepted}} the position of city librarian. Her poetry suffered {{as a result of}} her long work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland's library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.|$|E

5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, {{to the left of the}} north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family. To the right side of the altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E
5|$|After Rajrajeshwori {{took over}} the regency, she was {{pressured}} by Knox to pay the annual pension of 82,000 rupees to the ex-King as per the obligations of the treaty, which paid off the vast debt that Rana Bahadur Shah had accumulated in Varanasi due to his spendthrift habits. The Nepalese court also felt it prudent to keep Rana Bahadur in isolation in Nepal itself, {{rather than in the}} British controlled India, and that paying off Rana Bahadur's debts could facilitate his return at an opportune moment. Rajrajeshowri's presence in Kathmandu also stirred unrest among the courtiers that aligned themselves around her and Subarnaprabha. Sensing an imminent hostility, Knox aligned himself with Subarnaprabha and attempted to interfere with the internal politics of Nepal. Getting a wind of this matter, Rajrajeshowri dissolved the government and elected new ministers, with Damodar Pande as the mul kaji, while the Resident Knox, finding himself persona non grata and the objectives of his mission frustrated, voluntarily left Kathmandu to reside in Makwanpur citing a cholera epidemic. Subarnaprabha and the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> faction were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
