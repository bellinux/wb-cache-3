40|$|The {{interest}} in holistic considerations {{in the area}} of food safety is increasing. Risk managers may face the problem that reducing the risk of one compound may increase the risk of another compound. An example is the potential increase in mycotoxin levels due to a reduced use of fungicides in crop production. The Integrated Probabilistic Risk Assessment (IPRA) model was used to compare the estimated health impacts on humans caused by crops contaminated with the fungicides spiroxamine (SPI) and tebuconazole (TEB) or with the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). The IPRA model integrates a distribution characterising the <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> individuals with a distribution characterising the susceptibility of individuals towards toxic effects.

PVA-PEG graft co-polymer is a branched molecule consisting of about 75 % PVA and 25 % PEG units. The polymer is currently approved in pharmaceuticals in the EU.

No chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies were provided, but no adverse effects following long-term consumption of PVA-PEG graft co-polymer are expected given the absence of any substance-related adverse effects in the shorter-term toxicity studies {{and the fact that the}} co-polymer is virtually not absorbed following oral administration.
