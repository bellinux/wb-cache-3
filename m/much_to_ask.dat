25|$|After being {{defeated}} by a heavy margin of 223 runs and an innings pasting, India {{still had a}} chance of winning the remaining two tests to avoid a series defeat, but that was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> against the Invincibles, who were the better team in all respects. This test was the debut test of future Australian great, Neil Harvey.The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad disciplined bowling yielded four early wickets putting Sri Lanka on 38/4 after 14.1 overs. Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan {{started a}} {{recovery}} but after both their wickets fell within nine deliveries {{of each other}} the game was largely in England’s control. From then on wickets fell at regular intervals and although Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof added 43 runs for the final wicket it was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for the final pair to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

60|$|Sir Gervaise cared {{much less}} for things {{of this sort}} than Bluewater, but he {{naturally}} cast {{a glance at the}} speaker, as this was said, as <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> whom he meant.|$|R
25|$|New Zealand, {{with only}} four front-line bowlers, {{were able to}} contain England's batsmen but {{struggled}} to dismiss them. Centuries by Len Hutton and Denis Compton ensured a large score, but England made only 307 runs on the first day, Cowie taking five wickets, and Burtt mopped up the tail on the Monday morning to claim five also. Trevor Bailey, in his first Test, troubled the early batsmen with his pace, and the fourth wicket was down at 80. But Donnelly and Smith put on 120 and Smith went on to score 96. A last-wicket partnership between Mooney and Cowie put on 57 {{and went into the}} last morning, but Cowie was injured and could not bowl in England's second innings. Fast scoring by Bill Edrich and George Mann, and less fast by an injured Cyril Washbrook, who scored 103, led to a declaration. But 299 to win in 150 minutes was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> and Sutcliffe, Scott and Smith got batting practice as the game petered out.|$|E
2500|$|Designer Mark Beierle's {{original}} {{goals were}} an [...] "airplane with {{the feel of}} a hang glider, the agility and visibility of a helicopter, the effortless smooth flight of a sailplane, and the utility and economy of a general aviation aircraft--all in the hopes of getting close to the feel and freedom of a bird." [...] When queried by interviewer Don Downie if that was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> Beierle replied, [...] "You bet! But it didn't stop me from trying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still, some {{proponents of}} the BCS {{recognize}} the inconsistency that the system offers. An article taken from BCSfootball.org titled [...] "Playoff Smayoff! We Don't Need It" [...] openly states [...] "...trust the process and we will get it right 80 percent of the time." [...] As one sports writer argued, [...] "Is it too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for a system that gets it right every time" [...] instead of getting it right 4 out of 5 times? It {{is interesting to note}} that FBS football is the only sport in which the NCAA has not mandated a specific bracketed playoff system, with even Division I FCS conducting a playoff every year.|$|E

2500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{compared}} {{the film to}} other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the early 1980s {{rather than to the}} original. [...] "By the standards of most recent horror films, this—like its predecessor—is a class act." [...] She notes that there [...] "is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones." [...] Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, [...] "That may not be <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer." [...] David Pirie's review in Time Out magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, [...] "Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he makes a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel." [...] He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become [...] "an agent of Absolute Evil." [...] Film historian Jim Harper suggests, [...] "Time has been a little fairer to the film" [...] than original critics. In retrospect, [...] "many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties." ...|$|E

60|$|Toby wanted very <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> more questions, but he wisely {{concluded}} {{that it would not}} be agreeable to his companion.|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated, {{obviously}} embarrassed but determined. [...] "There is one question," [...] he said, [...] "which I should very <b>much</b> like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you. It {{will sound}} impertinent. I don't mean it so. I can't explain exactly why I want to know, but I have a reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sir Gervaise," [...] {{answered}} the fourth lieutenant, {{looking out of}} a lee port; [...] "it is the French admiral giving us another weather-gun; as <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why we don't go down. This is the second compliment of the same sort that he has paid us already to-day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," [...] {{said the}} lady {{as we entered}} a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, [...] "I should very <b>much</b> like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] and {{the girl}} {{clutched}} at the chance of respite, [...] "give me six months from to-day. It isn't very <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> Gregory." ...|$|E

6000|$|Isabel {{dropped her}} eyes, {{reflecting}} rapidly; Lord Warburton stood {{there looking at}} her and she felt his eyes on her face.

6000|$|... "Then I fancy that it {{has been}} open all night," [...] I declared, [...] "for {{to the best of my}} belief no one has passed through it save yourself. May I walk with you back to the house, Lady Angela? There is {{something}} which I should very <b>much</b> like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|They shook hands, and {{she sent}} her excuses to Lady Lucy {{for having been}} too <b>much</b> {{occupied}} <b>to</b> call, <b>asking</b> whether {{she was still in}} town.|$|R
60|$|I wanted very <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{something}} about the lady {{who had gone to}} school in Walford, but I thought it would be well to approach that subject by degrees.|$|E

60|$|As Sir Gervaise {{waved his}} hand, the young noble did not venture <b>to</b> reply, <b>much</b> less <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question, {{though there was}} not a little {{speculation}} on the poop of the Achilles, concerning the meaning of his words. The boat moved on, and five minutes later Sir Gervaise was on the quarter-deck of the Carnatic.|$|R
60|$|Harold March {{stared at}} him with round blue eyes, and seemed too <b>much</b> mystified even <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question. Fisher {{leaned back in his}} chair in his lazy fashion, and smiled as he continued.|$|R
60|$|I waited {{some little}} time, and tapped, for I had <b>much</b> still <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her; {{but she would}} return no answer, and I thought that I could hear her sobbing. At last I gave it up; and I {{was about to go}} into the house, for it was nearly dark now, when I heard the click of the garden gate. It was de Lapp himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Bobus. [...] "Oh! Jock, you don't {{know what it}} is to find you like this. I came with so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> and talk of to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear {{it is too}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> sir, {{but since}} you inquire what would please me most, {{it would be if}} you could spare me to go to my sister Harriet's wedding?" ...|$|E

60|$|Nigel felt <b>much</b> {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{what his}} business was, {{but there was}} a quiet something in the air of the hermit, when he did not choose to be questioned, which effectually silenced curiosity.

6000|$|Maisie {{wondered}} intensely {{what the}} reason could be, {{but she knew}} ever so <b>much</b> better than <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> She was slightly surprised indeed to perceive that Sir Claude didn't, and to hear him immediately enquire: [...] "What {{in the name of}} goodness can you have to say to her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Certainly <b>much</b> more. Also <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>to</b> make us good. That, too, {{must be a}} part of worshipping a good God. For {{the very}} {{property}} of goodness is, that it wishes to make others good. And if God be good, he must wish to make us good also.|$|R
