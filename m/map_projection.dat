5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E

5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E

25|$|However, Carl Friedrich Gauss's Theorema Egregium {{proved that}} a sphere's surface cannot be {{represented}} {{on a plane}} without distortion. The same applies to other reference surfaces used as models for the Earth. Since any <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> is a representation {{of one of those}} surfaces on a plane, all map projections distort. Every distinct <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> distorts in a distinct way. The study of map projections is the characterization of these distortions.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: firstly to present the current status and the {{weaknesses}} of the standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the employment of <b>map</b> <b>projections</b> in Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) and other Electronic Chart Systems (ECS), and secondly to propose specific <b>map</b> <b>projections</b> for use in navigational systems. The paper starts with a brief overview of the IMO performance standards for ECDIS and the corresponding industry practice concerning the use of <b>map</b> <b>projections</b> and the visualization of navigational paths. Seventeen different <b>map</b> <b>projections</b> are evaluated and compared with respect to their fitness for use in the ECDIS/ECS environment. The comparison is supported by specially constructed maps portraying selected loxodromic and orthodromic navigational paths and distortion analysis data. The conducted study shows that improved visual perception is possible through the proper choice among five alternative <b>map</b> <b>projections,</b> depending on the location and the extend of the area portrayed on the chart...|$|R

25|$|The Earth being spherical, any flat {{representation}} generates distortions {{such that}} shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.

25|$|Tangent and secant lines (standard lines) are {{represented}} undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, {{it is called}} a standard parallel.

25|$|The Gall–Peters {{projection}} is {{a rectangular}} <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> that maps all areas {{such that they}} have the correct sizes relative to each other. Like any equal-area projection, it achieves this goal by distorting most shapes.

25|$|A <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> is a {{systematic}} {{transformation of the}} latitudes and longitudes of locations {{from the surface of}} a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations on a plane. Maps cannot be created without map projections. All map projections necessarily distort the surface in some fashion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body {{at the expense of other}} properties. There is no limit to the number of possible map projections.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 9th century, the Persian {{mathematician}} and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed {{spherical trigonometry}} and <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> methods {{in order to}} convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, this type of projection {{had been used in}} ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{influence in}} the development of cartography was the patronage of the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun, who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of celestial meridian. Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs (mīl in Arabic) in comparison to the stadion used by Greeks. These efforts also enabled Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al-Mamun also commanded the production of a large map of the world, which has not survived, though it is known that its <b>map</b> <b>projection</b> type was based on Marinus of Tyre rather than Ptolemy.|$|E
