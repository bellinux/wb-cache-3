2500|$|Some {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the Somali ostrich may be better considered a full species, {{but there is no}} consensus among experts about this. The Tree of Life Project, The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World and [...] recognize it as a different species, but Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World does not. BirdLife International has reviewed the proposed split and accepted it. Mitochondrial DNA haplotype comparisons suggest that it diverged from the other ostriches not quite 4 mya due to formation of the East African Rift. Hybridization with the subspecies that evolved southwestwards of its range, S. c. massaicus, has apparently been prevented from occurring on a significant scale by ecological separation, the Somali ostrich preferring bushland where it browses middle-height vegetation for food while the <b>Masai</b> <b>ostrich</b> is, like the other subspecies, a grazing bird of the open savanna and miombo habitat.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Masai</b> <b>ostrich</b> (Struthio camelus massaicus), {{also known}} as the pink-necked ostrich or East African ostrich, is a large {{subspecies}} of the common ostrich native to East Africa. Today it is farmed for eggs, meat and feathers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wildlife}} of Kenya {{refers to}} its fauna. The diversity of Kenya's wildlife has garnered international fame, especially for its populations of large mammals. Its species of mammals include: East African lions (P. l. nubica), East African cheetahs (A. j. raineyi) hippopotami, African buffaloes, wildebeests, African elephants, zebras, giraffes, and rhinoceros. Kenya {{has a very}} diverse population of birds, including flamingos and <b>Masai</b> <b>ostriches</b> (S. c. massaicus) ...|$|R
50|$|Wildlife include Grant's zebra and the {{endangered}} Grevy's Zebra. Other species of mammal include reticulated giraffe, the African bush elephant, oryx, gerenuk, African buffalo, Masai lion, African leopard, Tanzanian cheetah and spotted hyena. Over 365 species of bird {{have been recorded}} in the reserve. The river is home to hippos and crocodiles. Somali ostriches are widespread within the national reserve. It {{is larger than the}} <b>Masai</b> <b>ostrich's</b> and is distinctive for their indigo legs and neck.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} a large and diverse {{wildlife}} population. Species found in the park include Cape buffaloes, baboons, eastern black rhinos, gazelles, zebras, Tanzanian cheetahs, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotami, leopards, Masai lions, elands, impala, <b>Masai</b> giraffes, <b>ostriches,</b> vultures and waterbucks.|$|R
50|$|Serengeti National Park {{has also}} great ornithological interest, boasting about 500 bird species, {{including}} <b>Masai</b> <b>ostrich,</b> secretarybird, kori bustards, helmeted guineafowls, southern ground hornbill, crowned cranes, marabou storks, yellow-billed stork, lesser flamingo, martial eagles, lovebirds, oxpeckers, and {{many species of}} vultures.|$|E
5000|$|Molecular {{evidence}} indicates that the East African Rift {{has served as a}} geographic barrier to isolate the taxon from the nominate subspecies, the North African ostrich S. c. camelus, while ecological and behavioural differences have kept it genetically distinct from the neighbouring <b>Masai</b> <b>ostrich</b> S. c. massaicus. [...] An examination of the mitochondrial DNA of Struthio taxa, including the extinct Arabian ostrich S. c. syriacus, has found that the Somali ostrich is phylogenetically the most distinct, appearing to have diverged from their common ancestor some 3.6 to 4.1 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|The Safari {{began as}} a small children's zoo in the National Park of Ramat Gan in 1958. In the late 1960s, the {{founding}} director Mr. Zvi Kirmeyer, {{was inspired by the}} novel concept of Safari Parks which were developing around the world during 1966-1974. He convinced the first mayor of Ramat Gan, Avraham Krinitzi, that a drive-through Safari Park in Israel was a viable idea. Following the tragic death of Mayor Krinitzi in an auto accident in 1969, the project continued with the active involvement of the next mayor of Ramat Gan, Dr. Yisrael Peled. Half of the existing National Park in Ramat Gan was dedicated to the new entity called The Zoological Corporation of Ramat Gan (250-acres). The Israeli landscape architect firm Miller-Blum-Lederer designed the park. The animals were supplied by Carr-Hartley from Tanzania, in 1968 and 1972 and included seven African elephants, eight white rhinos, Grant's zebras, Thomson's gazelles, defassa waterbuck, eland, <b>ostriches,</b> <b>Masai</b> giraffe, Grant's gazelles, beisa oryx, dik-diks, Gr√©vy's zebra and De Brazza's monkeys. The drive-through African park opened to the public in 1974 although no formal opening was held due to the Yom Kippur war. To this day the drive-through African Safari section, with its large and dynamic mixed herds of 13 species of mammals and birds, is the signature area for the visitor experience.|$|R
