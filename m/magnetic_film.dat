5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E

Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, corrosion, or poorly manufactured platters and heads.|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{magnetic}} devices, i. e., magnetic devices fabricated on flexible substrates, {{are very}} attractive in application of detecting magnetic field in arbitrary surface, non-contact actuators, and microwave devices {{due to the}} stretchable, biocompatible, light-weight, portable, and low cost properties. Flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> are essential for the realization of various functionalities of flexible magnetic devices. To give a comprehensive understanding for flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> and related devices, we have reviewed recent advances in the studies of flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> including fabrication methods, magnetic and transport properties of flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films,</b> and their applications in magnetic sensors, actuators, and microwave devices. Three typical methods were introduced to prepare the flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films.</b> Stretching or bending the flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> offers {{a good way to}} apply mechanical strain on <b>magnetic</b> <b>films,</b> so that <b>magnetic</b> anisotropy, exchanged bias, coercivity, and magnetoresistance can be effectively manipulated. Finally, a series of examples were shown to demonstrate the great potential of flexible <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> for future applications. Comment: 30 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} spin {{excitations}} in nanosized <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> in the Heisenberg model with magnetic dipole and exchange interactions by the spin operator diagram technique. Dispersion relations of spin waves in thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> (in two-dimensional <b>magnetic</b> monolayers and in two-layer <b>magnetic</b> <b>films)</b> and the spin-wave resonance spectrum in N-layer structures are found. For thick <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> generalized Landau-Lifshitz equations {{are derived from}} first principles. Landau-Lifshitz equations have the integral (pseudodifferential) form, but not differential one. Spin excitations are determined by simultaneous solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equations and the equation for the magnetostatic potential. For normal magnetized ferromagnetic films the spin wave damping has been calculated in the one-loop approximation for a diagram expansion of the Green functions at low temperature. In thick <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> the <b>magnetic</b> dipole interaction makes a major contribution to the relaxation of long-wavelength spin waves. Thin films have a region of low relaxation of long-wavelength spin waves. In thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> four-spin-wave processes take place and the exchange interaction makes a major contribution to the damping. It is found that the damping of spin waves propagating in magnetic monolayer {{is proportional to the}} quadratic dependence on the temperature and is very low for spin waves with small wavevectors. Spin-wave devices on the base of nanosized <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> are proposed [...] tunable narrow-band spin-wave filters with high quality at the microwave frequency range and field-effect transistor (FET) structures contained nanosized <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> under the gate electrode.

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|E
2500|$|... 1954, {{the year}} in which Balanchine first staged his {{production}} of it, was also the year that the first complete recording of the ballet appeared – a 2-LP album set in mono sound released by Mercury Records. The cover design was by George Maas and featured illustrations by Dorothy Maas. The music was performed by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Antal Doráti. Dorati later re-recorded the complete ballet in stereo, with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1962 for Mercury and with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1975 for Philips Classics. According to Mercury Records, the 1962 recording was made on 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> rather than audio tape, and used album cover art identical to that of the 1954 recording. Dorati is the only conductor so far to have made three different recordings of the complete ballet. Some have hailed the 1975 recording as the finest ever made of the complete ballet. It is also faithful to the score in employing a boys' choir in the Waltz of the Snowflakes. Many other recordings use an adult or mixed choir.|$|E
