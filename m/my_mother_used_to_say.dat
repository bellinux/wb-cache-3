Its iv’ry keys are turning brown, But ‘round it tender mem’ries cling; And with its sweetest tones have flown Those songs <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing: [Refrain] Oh, “Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,” Is a song that she oft’ sang to me, And the “Last Rose of Summer” Still {{breathes}} a fragrant melody. “Ah! Do you remember, sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?” From out the golden past those sweet notes ring, Tonight I hear those dear old songs again, Those songs <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing. [Verse 2] Its frame is falling to decay, The music from its soul has fled, And those dear hands that <b>used</b> <b>to</b> play, Like autumn leaves, lie still and dead. I see her dear form sitting there Sometimes, when fancy takes its wing; And then, with tear-dimm’d eyes, I hear Those songs <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing: [Chorus] Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen; Tenderly of Ireland’s Isle she sang, And of Bonnie Annie Laurie, That oft’ thro’ dear old Scotland’s mountains rang. Ah! Way down upon the Swanee River, What happiness those misty mem’ries bring, Tonight I hear those dear old songs again, Those songs <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing...|$|R

She would have begun by forbidding Annora to go, attended only by the servants, to prayers at the England ambassador's: but Eustace had foreseen this, and made arrangements with a good old knight and his lady, Sir Francis Ommaney, always to call for my sister on their way to church, and she was always ready for them. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that her devotion was all perverseness, and now and then, when more than usually provoked with her, would declare that it was quite plain that her poor child's religion was only a heresy, since it did not make her a better daughter.|$|E

Between you and me, as my half {{brothers}} and sisters increased and multiplied year after year, I used to feel rather lonely, rather bowled out, you understand. But I saw them so happy that I longed to have a home of my own. When my mother proposed Arabella for me (for she and Lady Kicklebury were immense friends at one time), I was glad enough to give up clubs and bachelorhood, and to settle down as a married man. My mother acted for the best. My poor wife's character, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> changed after marriage. I was not as happy as I hoped to be; but I tried for it. George, I am not so comfortable now as I might be. A house without a mistress, with two mothers-in-law reigning over it--one worldly and aristocratic, another what you call serious, though she don't mind a rubber of whist: I give you my honor my mother plays a game at whist, and an uncommonly good game too--each woman dragging over a child to her side: of course such a family cannot be comfortable.

60|$|August 29.--Went on {{our little}} expedition, breakfasting at Mertoun. Called at Fleurs, {{where we found}} Sir John S. and his whole family. The great lady {{received}} us well, though we had been very remiss in our duty. From that we went to Kelso, where I saw not a soul to acknowledge former acquaintance. How should I, when my residence there was before 1783, I fancy?[29] The little cottage in which I lived with poor Aunt Jenny is still standing, but the great garden is divided betwixt three proprietors. Its huge platanus tree withered, I was told, in the same season which was fatal to {{so many of the}} species. It was cut down. The yew-hedges, labyrinths, wildernesses, and other marks that it had once been the abode of one of the Millers connected with the author of the Gardener's Dictionary (they were a Quaker family), are all obliterated, and the place is as common and vulgar as may be. The lady the cottage belongs to was very civil. Allan, as a man of taste, was much delighted with what he saw. When we returned, we found our party at home increased by Lady Anna Maria Elliot, who had been showing Melrose to two friends, Miss Drinkwaters. Lady M.'s wit and good-humour made the evening go pleasantly off. There were also two friends of Charles's, by name Paley (a nephew of the archdeacon) and Ashworth. They seem nice young men, with modesty and good-breeding. I am glad, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that his friends are so presentable. Moreover, there came my old, right trusty, and well-beloved friend, John Richardson, so we were a full party. Lady Anna Maria returned in the evening. Francis Scott also dined with us.|$|E
60|$|WISE MAN. Though {{they call}} him Teigue the Fool, he is not more foolish than {{everybody}} used to be, with their dreams and their preachings and their three worlds; but I have overthrown their three worlds with the seven sciences. [He touches the books with his hands.] With Philosophy that was made for the lonely star, I have taught them to forget Theology; with Architecture, I have hidden the ramparts of their cloudy heaven; with Music, the fierce planets' daughter whose hair is always on fire, and with Grammar that is the moon's daughter, I have shut their ears to the imaginary harpings and speech of the angels; and I have made formations of battle with Arithmetic that have put the hosts of heaven to the rout. But, Rhetoric and Dialectic, that have been born out of the light star {{and out of the}} amorous star, you have been my spearman and my catapult! Oh! my swift horseman! Oh! my keen darting arguments, it is because of you that I have overthrown the hosts of foolishness! [An ANGEL, in a dress the color of embers, and carrying a blossoming apple bough in his hand and with a gilded halo about his head, stands upon the threshold.] Before I came, men's minds were stuffed with folly about a heaven where birds sang the hours, and about angels that came and stood upon men's thresholds. But I have locked the visions into heaven and turned the key upon them. Well, I must consider this passage about the two countries. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something of the kind. She would say that when our bodies sleep our souls awake, and that whatever withers here ripens yonder, and that harvests are snatched from us that they may feed invisible people. But the meaning of the book must be different, for only fools and women have thoughts like that; their thoughts were never written upon the walls of Babylon. [He sees the ANGEL.] What are you? Who are you? I think I saw some that were like you in my dreams when I was a child--that bright thing, that dress that is the color of embers! But I have done with dreams, I have done with dreams.|$|E
60|$|Must a woman {{come into}} our house and {{discover}} that I was not such a dreary dog as I had the reputation of being? Was I to be seen at last with the veil of dourness lifted? My company voice is so low and unimpressive that my first remark is merely an intimation that I am about to speak (like the whir of the clock before it strikes): must it be revealed that I had another voice, that there was one door I never opened without leaving my reserve on the mat? Ah, that room, must its secrets be disclosed? So joyous they were {{when my mother was}} well, no wonder we were merry. Again and again she had been given back to us; it was for the glorious to-day we thanked God; in our hearts we knew and in our prayers confessed that the fill of delight had been given us, whatever might befall. We had not to wait till all was over to know its value; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> ‘We never understand how little we need in this world until we know the loss of it,’ and there can be few truer sayings, but during her last years we exulted daily in the possession of her {{as much as we can}} exult in her memory. No wonder, I say, that we were merry, but we liked to show it to God alone, and to Him only our agony during those many night-alarms, when lights flickered in the house and white faces were round my mother’s bedside. Not for other eyes those long vigils when, night about, we sat watching, nor the awful nights when we stood together, teeth clenched—waiting—it must be now. And it was not then; her hand became cooler, her breathing more easy; she smiled to us. Once more I could work by snatches, and was glad, but what was the result to me compared to the joy of hearing that voice from the other room? There lay all the work I was ever proud of, the rest is but honest craftsmanship done to give her coal and food and softer pillows. My thousand letters that she so carefully preserved, always sleeping with the last beneath the sheet, where one was found when she died—they are the only writing of mine of which I shall ever boast. I would not there had been one less though I could have written an immortal book for it.|$|E
