50|$|A picture above {{shows an}} STC SLU (Subscribers' Line Unit - {{in those days}} {{customers}} were always called subscribers, invariably shortened in conversation to 'subs'). It handled the traffic to and from five customers, and had five trunks going on to the B switches. There is therefore a 5×5 switching matrix of reed relays, which constituted the A-switch. Note that the four reeds {{in each of these}} reed relay were in-line, whereas in Plessey reed-relays the reeds were in a square formation. The SLU also contained 10 electro-mechanical relays, two for each line. They were the Line Relay (LR), which was operated when the customer picked up the handset and which generated the calling signal, and a K relay which gave the correct tones and prevented spurious calling conditions. These two relays both provided change-over contacts and therefore had to be electro-mechanical, because the reed-relays only gave <b>make-break</b> contacts. The face-plate of the unit is to the right: at the other end one can see the edge connector. It was feared that this type of connector would cause problems after a relatively low number of removal/re-insertion operations, but in practice they proved to be more than adequately robust.|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of fibrous reinforced silver matrix composites to repeated <b>make-break</b> arc erosion {{has been investigated}} in this study. Three different types of short fibers were used as reinforcements, including graphite short fibers, Saffil short fibers, and silicon carbide whiskers. The weight losses of eroded composites increase with fiber content, applied current, and test number due to the worse thermal conductivity of the composites and the higher remained temperatures on contact surfaces. The composites reinforced with Saffil short fibers exhibit the best erosion {{resistance of}} all reinforcements in the study {{because of the small}} spacings between Saffil short fibers and the strengthening of strong short-fiber skeletons. The effective contribution of short fibers to arc erosion resistance depends on their sizes to construct small-spacing and deeply-embedded skeletons. (C) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E

By selected conditions of heat treatment in a high vacuum environment the plating can acquire Cr-equivalent hardness without the effluents of the hard chromium plating process. The surfaces were characterized under scanning electron microscope and by XRD. The fabricated materials were tested under corrosion conditions by polarization measurements. Semispherical nickel plated steel joints were tested in a computer controlled contact <b>make-break</b> apparatus, under simultaneous application of a mechanical and a low-voltage electrical load for 20, 000 cycles. After heat treatment the plating acquires a crystalline structure with very good adhesion to the substrate material. Corrosion decreases and increased hardness is obtained.

By selected conditions of heat treatment in a high vacuum environment the plating can produce chromium equivalent hardness without the effluents of the hard chromium plating process. The resulting surfaces were examined and characterized under an optical and a scanning electron microscope. XRD analysis was also performed to investigate re-crystallization effects, especially after heat treatment. The fabricated contact materials were also tested under corrosion conditions and linear polarization measurements were performed on them. Finally, to indicate {{the significance of the}} substrate material, semispherical nickel plated brass and steel joints were tested under the simultaneous application of a mechanical and an electrical contact load exceeding 10, 000 duty cycles. The contact resistance was also monitored during the computer controlled contact <b>make-break</b> operations. The results show that, after heat treatment in a high vacuum environment (10 (- 6) mbar), the plating acquires a crystalline structure, with very good adhesion to the substrate material. In addition it is characterized with good electrical properties during corrosion aging accelerated tests...|$|E
40|$|Silver {{and silver}} based alloy (90 % Ag- 10 % CdO) {{contacts}} welded on different substrate materials {{have been exposed}} in hostile SO 2 environments in simulated laboratory conditions. The corrosion byproducts on the surface have been monitored by SEM and EDS spectroscopy. Their electrical characterization was based upon de overheat tests, current switching cycle tests and interfacial energy storage during ac current excitation. The experimental results demonstrate that the heat dissipation rates strongly depend on the substrate material selection as well as, the exposure environments. These parameters strongly affect the nominal current values. The dynamic contact resistance during <b>make-break</b> electrical contact operations depends upon the conductivity of the new surface layers formed {{as a result of}} chemical equilibrium established by the reaction between the environment and the primary surface material, the substrate, and the welding layers. Corrosion byproducts are formed over the contact joint and are transported to the silver surface of the electrical contact by creep. The resulting byproducts, may be either loosely attached or water-soluble. Corrosion products originate from the welding zone, the substrate material, and the underplating layer by diffusing through the pores of the plating; they aggregate on the surface and affect the heat dissipation rate and consequently the electrical performance of the component...|$|E
40|$|The {{stimulation}} of cardiac {{tissue in the}} recovery phase has significant importance in relation to reentry induction. In the theoretical experiment proposed by Winfree, termed the ‘pinwheel' experiment, a point stimulus (S 2) is applied {{in the wake of}} a freely propagating planar wave (S 1). Reentry induced from this S 1 –S 2 pinwheel protocol has been observed experimentally in heart preparations. However, in these experiments, which focused on activation outcomes, only mapping of extracellular voltages has been conducted. The lack of transmembrane potential (Vm) distribution data makes it impossible to analyse the underlying stimulation mechanisms which precede the reentry induction. In this work we sought to elucidate the stimulation mechanisms throughout the heart cycle using the pinwheel protocol. We examined the cardiac tissue responses during and immediately after cathodal stimulation in the refractory wake of a propagating planar wave. The voltage-sensitive dye di- 4 -ANEPPS was utilized to measure Vm directly from quasi two-dimensional preparations of cryoablated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Four stimulation mechanisms were observed that depended on the Vm magnitude during S 2 cathodal stimulation. Make stimulation always occurred during diastolic stimulation. When stimulation was at the beginning of the relative refractory period (RRP), transitional <b>make–break</b> stimulation was detected. During the RRP the excitation was due to the break mechanism. While approaching the effective refractory period (ERP), the tissue response is characterized by a damped wave mediated response. These four stimulation mechanisms were observed in all hearts whether the S 1 planar wave propagation was parallel or perpendicular to the fibre direction. This study is the first examination of Vm and the stimulation mechanisms throughout the cardiac cycle using the pinwheel protocol, and the results have implications in the development and improvement of pacing protocols for artificial cardiostimulators...|$|E
40|$|Relays and {{switches}} {{are of interest}} in applications such as test equipment, radar, communications, and power systems, amongst others. Unlike solid state switches, mechanical relays provide galvanic isolation across the power ports. This characteristic is important because, for safety reasons, electrical codes stipulate that loads in certain power applications must be disconnected by open gaps. This requirement imposes significant isolation, heat dissipation, tribology and reliability constraints on a relay. The objective {{of this research is}} to explore power handling by a MEMS device in a relay context. This work presents concepts, analytical performance models, fabrication processes and design rules for MEMS relays capable of hot-switching inductive loads in power applications. To this end, a horizontal-displacement, electrostaticallyactuated, MEMS relay for <b>make-break</b> power switching applications is presented. The MEMS-relays are etched in (100) Si through a combination of KOH etching, and DRIE, bonded to a glass substrate, and plated with a 10 /pm thick buffer film of either copper or nickel-cobalt, and a 1 - 2 [mu]m thick film of a platinum-family metal such as palladium, rhodium, and alloyed palladium (palladium-cobalt). The relays feature { 111 }-plane silicon-etched electrical contacts. The { 111 }-plane contacts provide travel of 30 - 80 [mu]m, which prevents arcing. Their oblique geometry introduces contact wipe, which is known to enhance the contact reliability. Further, the contact geometry allows for an enhanced metallization process which provides lower on-state contact resistance than traditional horizontal displacement Mems-relays. Experimental relays exhibit a best-case total on-state contact resistance of 130 m[omega], a response time of 750 [mu]s, a settling time of 3 ms, electrical isolation in excess of 1 kV (tested to 997 V with available equipment), a hot switched current of 800 mA using resistive loads, and a hot switched current of 350 mA using a 1 mH inductive load. The relays have been hot-switched in excess of 10 ⁵ cycles without signs of performance degradation. by Alexis Christian Weber. Thesis (Ph. D.)
