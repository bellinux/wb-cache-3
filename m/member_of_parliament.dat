40|$|When {{moving from}} a {{plurality}} rule to a proportional system, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> national <b>parliament</b> have more incentives to diverge from the median voter's preferences. We match voting behavior concerning legislative proposals <b>of</b> Swiss <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> with real referenda outcomes on the same issues for the years 1996 to 2009. This quasi-experimental data allows us to identify whether differences in electoral systems induce <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> to diverge from the choices of the median voter. Empirical results indicate that <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> from districts with proportional representation tend to diverge significantly more from the median voter's preferences than <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament</b> from districts with plurality rule...|$|R
