500|$|On either June 2 or November 5, 1773, White {{purchased}} the [...] estate of Henry Heth, who had foreclosed on his <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement</b> with William McMachen. McMachen sold {{the property to}} White for 500 pounds following his relocation to Hampshire County. White renamed the property [...] "Woodville", presumably after his wife Elizabeth's family, and it remained his primary residence {{until his death in}} 1804. [...] "Woodville" [...] is presently located [...] northwest of Winchester's Sunnyside neighborhood and approximately [...] northeast of Apple Pie Ridge Road (Virginia Secondary Route 739).|$|E
500|$|Despite these doubts, the {{cornerstone}} of the new church was laid on July 16, 1899, by Archbishop Adélard Langevin of Saint Boniface. [...] Thomas Ennor Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects, and in just 491 days, the construction was completed. [...] At the time it was finished, the building was praised as [...] "the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco." [...] The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8, 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland, Oregon. [...] By the end of the decade, it became [...] "the most financially important parish" [...] in the archdiocese, since it was the only church that not only could break-even, but could also churn out a surplus. [...] Because of this, Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see. [...] The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church, and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral. [...] Nonetheless, the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916, but the Oblates were permitted to remain. [...] The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement</b> that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral. [...] This was coupled with the [...] "growing manpower shortage" [...] caused by a declining number of members joining the order.|$|E
2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement</b> could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E

50|$|The most {{relevant}} protective measure at common law {{today is the}} right of borrowers to cancel mortgages if they were misrepresented about the mortgage's terms, or if they entered agreements because of undue influence. In the leading case, Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2), a group of appeals all involved a husband allegedly pressuring his wife into signing a <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement</b> with a bank, where security was over the family home. The House of Lords agreed that undue influence would make a contract voidable, and if a bank should have realised this possibility, it could not enforce the <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement</b> against the spouse's share of the home. Accordingly, if banks wished to ensure valid mortgages {{they would need to}} have confirmation from an independent solicitor that the spouse fully understood the transaction. This ruling was intended to eliminate cases where people do not understand the consequences of mortgages. Alternatively, if despite independent advice, a spouse is still unduly influenced or is misrepresented the facts, he or she will have no recourse against a bank selling the home, but may have a claim against the solicitor for negligence.|$|E

2500|$|Mortgage {{payments}} from homeowners are deposited into a locally administered [...] "Fund for Humanity", {{the proceeds of}} which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreements</b> require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home {{during the period of}} their mortgage, the affiliate will buy it back at market value. Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.|$|R
50|$|If the {{proceeds}} of the sale are not sufficient to settle the account, the credit provider may approach the court for an order to recover the outstanding balance. This applies {{in the case of the}} instalment agreement, secured loan or lease. Strangely absent from this list is the <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement.</b> This implies that the mortgagee (a bank, usually) will be able to rely only on {{the proceeds}} of the sale of the property to settle the account—even if this is insufficient, and even if the mortgagor (the debtor) is very wealthy and has other assets that could be attached.|$|E
50|$|If a {{borrower}} does {{default on}} a loan (due to insolvency or other event), that borrower forfeits (gives up) the property pledged as collateral, with the lender then becoming {{the owner of}} the property.

Should the buyer fail to repay the loan according to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement,</b> the lender can use the legal process of foreclosure to obtain ownership of the real estate. A pawnbroker is a common example of a business that may accept a wide range of items as collateral.|$|E

50|$|Mortgages in English law are {{a method}} of raising capital through a loan contract, {{typically}} with a bank, where if the borrower does not repay, the bank may take a mortgaged asset, typically a home or building.

These concern, first, the common law, statutory and regulatory rules to protect the mortgagor (i.e. the borrower) at the time of concluding the <b>mortgage</b> <b>agreement.</b> Second, English law defines and restricts the process for taking possession of property in the event of default. Third, it places duties on mortgagees (i.e. lenders, like banks) on the price it achieves when selling property.|$|E

Beyond common law, there are three main kinds of statutory protection. First, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 codified a system of licensing for mortgage lenders. The Financial Conduct Authority maintains a Code of Practice and enforces compliance with the threat of license withdrawal. Second, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 empowers the Office of Fair Trading to engage in similar regulation of the second mortgage market. Third, the content of mortgage is regulated by ordinary consumer contract protection in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The general thrust of the law is to ensure complete transparency, and to cancel extortionate credit agreements, so that consumers know what they are getting, and do not get an unfair bargain.|$|E
