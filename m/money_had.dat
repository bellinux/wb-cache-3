40|$|ABSTRACT: Development is {{the upward}} {{directional}} movement of society from lesser to {{greater levels of}} energy, efficiency, quality, productivity, complexity, comprehension, creativity, enjoyment and accomplishment. These attributes are both the means for achieving development {{as well as its}} most characteristic expressions or results. <b>Money</b> <b>has</b> played a parallel role at the social level as a medium for urbanization, multiplying economic activities by several orders of magnitude. The forms <b>money</b> <b>has</b> taken on over centuries have always been closely connected with the technological developments in the economy. As simple economies evolved into more complicated economies, <b>money</b> <b>has</b> always adapted to the different economic circumstances. With respect to the latest innovations in the computer industry a new form of <b>money</b> <b>has</b> evolved: e-money...|$|R

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been {{found at a}} distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since <b>money</b> <b>had</b> already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the <b>money</b> <b>had</b> come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E
5|$|In late 2003, it was {{discovered}} that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100,000 East Caribbean dollars. While Browne denied suggestions that this had constituted bribery, claiming that the <b>money</b> <b>had</b> gone towards community projects, Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign. Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John's, and the news led to protesters picketing their offices. Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers, and despite a motion of censure brought by the opposition and more protests, Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne.|$|E

However, the club claimed that none of its own <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E

The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion.

The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E

5|$|Although men and <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been secured, {{the markets}} {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear {{was a factor in}} the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E
5|$|By 1838 it {{had become}} clear that {{construction}} costs for the town were spiralling out of control. To make matters worse, the railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood {{that the cost of}} the railway was expected to exceed £300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get £4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices that needed to be paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a number of enterprises in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society.|$|E
