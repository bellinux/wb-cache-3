25|$|Throughout {{the late}} eighties and early nineties the {{infrastructure}} {{at the ground}} was given a major overhaul, with the <b>mini</b> <b>stand</b> at the home end of the ground being redeveloped. In its place is now the family stand - a covered, all seater stand with board rooms, a club shop, restaurant and club bar. After this was completed attention turned to redevelopment of the 'popular side', which was fully covered and updated to modern-day standards. In 2000–01 the away end was also redeveloped with a new covered standing area.|$|R

Its dome-kitchen structure separately engineered from the church and the convent is one of its odd and distinct features. Some parts of the church are currently being renovated as there are plans to promote it as a tourist attraction. Father Layog adds there are plans to put up a gallery so that visitors can appreciate the church’s historical value.|$|R

40|$|Configurations and Software: A Tutorial This paper, {{together}} with the preceding paper by Divilbiss, is intended to provide a background for the characteristics of minicomputers {{and the ways in}} which they can be configured to tackle library problems. As part of the discussion of minicomputer features, an attempt is made to compare and contrast them with larger, general purpose computers. An acquaintance with basic computer concepts is assumed. Concepts of a more technical nature are explained as they are introduced. The first section below discusses configurations; the second section covers minicomputer software. Hardware and architectural features are covered in the paper by Divilbiss. MINICOMPUTER CONFIGURATIONS Minicomputers and their associated peripheral devices can be combined in a great variety of ways, but this variety can be categorized into four basic configuration types: (1) stand-alone batch, (2) stand-alone on-line, (3) front end, and (4) remote concentrator. The first type, stand-alone batch, is the most familiar (see figure 1). In this configuration, the mini looks like and performs like larger batch computers. In most cases the mini will have a card reader and punch, a line printer, tape drives and disks. (The minis in all four configuration types will have operator consoles, but to avoid cluttering the figures, the consoles have been omitted.) The term stand-alone is part of the name of this configuration in order to stress the fact that the mini is not connected to a larger computer. The <b>mini</b> <b>stands</b> alone. The main use of the stand-alone batch configuration is the generation of printed products, e. g., serials lists, purchase orders, circulation lists and overdue notices. This configuration could also be used fo...|$|R

40|$|In New Zealand, low needle {{retention}} in Pinus radiata D. Don {{is often}} associated with infection by a needle-cast fungus, Cyclaneusma minus (Butin) DiCosmo et al., and with a condition known as upper mid-crown yellowing (UMCY). Variability in the expression of these two disorders is known to be controlled by both environmental and genetic factors. In order to estimate the degree of genetic control, adjacent seedlings and clonal trees (six clones selected for vigour in the nursery) were assessed at age 22 years for symptoms of UMCY and of C. <b>minus</b> in <b>stands</b> thinned to three final-crop stocking rates. Estimates of genotypic and non-genetic variance and of broad-sense heritability (ratio of genotypic to phenotypic variance) were obtained in two ways: (a) by subtracting the observed within-clone variance from the phenotypic variance of seedling trees, and (b) by directly estimating clone-to-clone variance. Values obtained by these methods agreed well {{with each other and with}} earlier estimates made in a nearby seed orchard. Factors related to method of propagation and physiological ageing are therefore unlikely to inflate clonal variation. Clones may be the more cost-effective indicator for UMCY studies. Genotypic variance in resistance to both disorders is considered to be sufficiently high (at least 64 % for UMCY and 44 % for C minus) to warrant consideration in silvicultural practices...|$|R
40|$|Background:?DNA {{methylation}} is {{an important}} regulator of gene expression and chromatin structure. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) is commonly used to identify regions of DNA methylation in eukaryotic genomes. Within MeDIP-Seq libraries, methylated cytosines {{can be found in}} both double-stranded (symmetric) and single-stranded (asymmetric) genomic contexts. While symmetric CG methylation has been relatively well-studied, asymmetric methylation in any dinucleotide context has received less attention. Importantly, no currently available software for processing MeDIP-Seq reads is able to resolve these strand-specific DNA methylation signals. Here we introduce DISMISS, a new software package that detects strand-associated DNA methylation from existing MeDIP-Seq analyses. ? Results:?Using MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from Apis mellifera (honeybee), an invertebrate species that contains more asymmetric- than symmetric- DNA methylation, we demonstrate that DISMISS can identify strand-specific DNA methylation signals with similar accuracy as bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq; single nucleotide resolution methodology). Specifically, DISMISS is able to confidently predict where DNA methylation predominates (plus or minus DNA strands ? asymmetric DNA methylation; plus and <b>minus</b> DNA <b>stands</b> ? symmetric DNA methylation) in MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from A. mellifera samples. When compared to DNA methylation data derived from BS-Seq analysis of A. mellifera worker larva, DISMISS-mediated identification of strand-specific methylated cytosines is 80 % accurate. Furthermore, DISMISS can correctly (p < 0. 0001) detect the origin (sense vs antisense DNA strands) of DNA methylation at splice site junctions in A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets with a precision close to BS-Seq analysis. Finally, DISMISS-mediated identification of DNA methylation signals associated with upstream, exonic, intronic and downstream genomic loci from A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets outperforms MACS 2 (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq 2; a commonly used MeDIP-Seq analysis software) and closely approaches the results achieved by BS-Seq. ? Conclusions:?While asymmetric DNA methylation is increasingly being found in growing numbers of eukaryotic species and is the predominant pattern observed in some invertebrate genomes, it has been difficult to detect in MeDIP-Seq datasets using existing software. DISMISS now enables more sensitive examinations of MeDIP-Seq datasets and will be especially useful for the study of genomes containing either low levels of DNA methylation or for genomes containing relatively high amounts of asymmetric methylation. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} three empirically based {{methods of}} monitoring forest growth between 1991 and 2000 from airborne {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR). In the first method, height change and volume change between 1991 and 2000 were estimated from the mean L-band stand backscatter {{difference between the two}} dates. Height change and volume change over the 9 -year period were estimated with an accuracy of 0. 23  m and 15  m 3  ha - 1, respectively, when the stands were below saturation point for the first date. The accuracy of the results was lower for stands beyond saturation in both data sets. In the second method, the height change is calculated from the estimated stand height in 2000 <b>minus</b> the estimated <b>stand</b> height in 1991. The second method produced poorer results than the first method, but better results than predicted by the error propagation equation. The difference between the observed accuracy and the expected error (based on the error propagation equation) appears to be due to a systematic bias in both the 1991 and 2000 estimates, as the residuals are correlated for stands below 20 years old (r  =  0. 71 for stand volume residuals). The third experiment investigates the utility of data from two dates to classify the stands into three age classes. The results show that, with two images separated by 9 years, 85 % of stands were correctly classified compared with 69 % for a single date L-HV image...|$|R
