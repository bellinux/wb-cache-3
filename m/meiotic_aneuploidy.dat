40|$|Intercellular {{differences}} of chromosomal {{content in the}} same individual are defined as chromosomal mosaicism (alias intercellular or somatic genomic variations or, {{in a number of}} publications, mosaic aneuploidy). It has long been suggested that this phenomenon poorly contributes both to intercellular (interindividual) diversity and to human disease. However, our views have recently become to change due to a series of communications demonstrated a higher incidence of chromosomal mosaicism in diseased individuals (major psychiatric disorders and autoimmune diseases) as well as depicted chromosomal mosaicism contribution to genetic diversity, the central nervous system development, and aging. The later has been produced by significant achievements in the field of molecular cytogenetics. Recently, Molecular Cytogenetics has published an article by Maj Hulten and colleagues that has provided evidences for chromosomal mosaicism to underlie formation of germline aneuploidy in human female gametes using trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) as a model. Since <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> is suggested to be the leading genetic cause of human prenatal mortality and postnatal morbidity, these data together with previous findings define chromosomal mosaicism not as a casual finding during cytogenetic analyses but as a more significant biological phenomenon than previously recognized. Finally, the significance of chromosomal mosaicism can be drawn from the fact, that this phenomenon is involved in genetic diversity, normal and abnormal prenatal development, human diseases, aging, and <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy,</b> the intrinsic cause of which remains, as yet, unknown. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Maternal {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with poor outcomes across the reproductive spectrum including infertility, increased time to pregnancy, early pregnancy loss, fetal loss, congenital abnormalities and neonatal conditions. Furthermore, the proportion of reproductive-aged woman that are obese in the population is increasing sharply. From current studies {{it is not clear}} if the origin of the reproductive complications is attributable to problems that arise in the oocyte or the uterine environment. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the developmental basis of the reproductive phenotypes in obese animals by employing a high fat diet mouse model of obesity. We analyzed very early embryonic and fetal phenotypes, which can be parsed into three abnormal developmental processes that occur in obese mothers. The first is oocyte <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> that then leads to early embryonic loss. The second is an abnormal process distinct from <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> that also leads to early embryonic loss. The third is fetal growth retardation and brain developmental abnormalities, which based on embryo transfer experiments are not due to the obese uterine environment but instead must be from a defect that arises prior to the blastocyst stage. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that reproductive complications in obese females are, at least in part, from oocyte maternal effects.

40|$|Mosaic {{aneuploidy}} and {{uniparental disomy}} (UPD) arise from mitotic or meiotic events. There are {{differences between these}} mechanisms in terms of (i) impact on embryonic development; (ii) co-occurrence of mosaic trisomy and UPD and (iii) potential recurrence risks. We used a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to study patients with chromosome aneuploidy mosaicism, UPD and one individual with XX/XY chimerism to gain insight into the developmental mechanism and timing of these events. Sixteen cases of mosaic aneuploidy originated mitotically, and these included four rare trisomies {{and all of the}} monosomies, consistent with the influence of selective factors. Five trisomies arose meiotically, and three of the five had UPD in the disomic cells, confirming increased risk for UPD in the case of meiotic non-disjunction. Evidence for the <b>meiotic</b> origin of <b>aneuploidy</b> and UPD was seen in the patterns of recombination visible during analysis with 1 – 3 crossovers per chromosome. The mechanisms of formation of the UPD included trisomy rescue, with and without concomitant trisomy, monosomy rescue, and mitotic formation of a mosaic segmental UPD. UPD was also identified in an XX/XY chimeric individual, with one cell line having complete maternal UPD consistent with a parthenogenetic origin. Utilization of SNP arrays allows simultaneous evaluation of genomic alterations and insights into aneuploidy and UPD mechanisms. Differentiation of mitotic and <b>meiotic</b> origins for <b>aneuploidy</b> and UPD supports existence of selective factors against full trisomy of some chromosomes in the early embryo and provides data for estimation of recurrence and disease mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{suffer from}} {{high rates of}} fetal aneuploidy, often arising from the absence of meiotic {{crossover}} recombination between homologous chromosomes 1. Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the SPO 11 transesterase 2. In yeast and worms, at least one buffering mechanism, crossover homeostasis, maintains crossover numbers despite variation in DSB numbers 3 – 8. We show here that mammals display progressive homeostatic control of recombination. In wild-type mouse spermatocytes, focus numbers for early recombination proteins (RAD 51, DMC 1) were highly variable from cell to cell, whereas foci of the crossover marker MLH 1 showed little variability. Furthermore, mice with greater or fewer copies of the Spo 11 gene — with correspondingly greater or fewer numbers of early recombination foci — displayed relatively invariant crossover numbers. Homeostatic control is enforced during at least two stages, after the formation of early recombination intermediates and later while these intermediates mature toward crossovers. Thus, variability within the mammalian meiotic program is robustly managed by homeostatic mechanisms to control crossover formation, probably to suppress <b>aneuploidy.</b> <b>Meiotic</b> recombination exemplifies how order can b...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis {{includes}} two successive {{divisions of the}} nucleus with one round of DNA replication and leads {{to the formation of}} gametes with half of the chromosomes of the mother cell during sexual reproduction. It provides a cytological basis for gametogenesis and nheritance in eukaryotes. Meiotic cell division is a complex and dynamic process that involves a number of molecular and cellular events, such as DNA and chromosome replication, chromosome pairing, synapsis and recombination, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Meiosis maintains genome stability and integrity over sexual life cycles. On the other hand, meiosis generates genome variations in several ways. Variant meiotic recombination resulting from specific genome structures induces deletions, duplications, and other rearrangements within the genic and non-genic genomic regions and has been considered a major driving force for gene and genome evolution in nature. Meiotic abnormalities in chromosome segregation lead to chromosomally imbalanced gametes and <b>aneuploidy.</b> <b>Meiotic</b> restitution due to failure of the first or second meiotic division gives rise to unreduced gametes, which triggers polyploidization and genome expansion. This paper reviews research regarding meiosis-driven genome variation, including deletion and duplication of genomic regions, aneuploidy, and polyploidization, and discusses the effect of related meiotic events on genome variation and evolution in plants. Knowledge of various meiosis-driven genome variations provides insight into genome evolution and genetic variability in plants and facilitates plant genome research...|$|R
40|$|A system {{suitable}} {{for the detection of}} <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> is described in which various different origins of the aneuploidy can be distinguished. Aneuploid meiotic products are detected as black disomic spores held in asci containing all the products of a single meiosis. Aneuploidy may result from nondisjunction or from a meiosis in which an extra replica of one of the chromosomes has been generated in some other way, e. g., extra replication. By using this system {{it has been shown that}} pFPA treatment increase aneuploidy, primarily through an effect on nondisjunction. Preliminary results with trifluralin have indicated that this compound, too, may increase aneuploidy. There is a good possibility that the system can be further developed to permit a more rapid screening using a random plating method; this wili allow a more efficient two-part analysis of the effects of compounds under test...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{fluorescence}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (QF-PCR) is a molecular genetic method based on the amplification of microsatellites (Short tandem repeats, STR) and measurement of the peak heights of amplicons in the electropherogram. Currently, the QF- PCR deemed reliable, fast, and inexpensive method that is gradually replacing conventional cytogenetic analysis of aneuploidy (examination of long-term cultures of amniotic fluid). However, in certain cases {{it is impossible to}} determine the parental origin and <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> by QF-PCR. The aim of this work was to verify the new dinucleotide STR markers on chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, and 22 and further increase the diagnostic efficiency of QF-PCR retaining other STR markers on chromosome 15, 16, 22 and to determine the population and the analytical characteristics of these markers. For all dinucleotide STR markers stutter occurred in high frequency and therefore there were found not to be suitable for routine diagnostics. STR markers for chromosomes 15, 16 and 22 were tested on 100 patients. We selected four informative markers for both chromosome 16 and 22, and three markers for chromosome 15. Thus, I expanded set of diagnostic STR markers in this thesis. Key words: QF-PCR, STR markers, prenatal diagnosis, trisomy...|$|E
40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{screening}} is being scrutinized, as recent randomized clinical trials failed {{to observe the}} expected significant increase in live birth rates following {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) -based screening. Although these randomized clinical trials are criticized on their design, skills or premature stop, it is generally believed that well-designed and well-executed randomized clinical trials would resolve the debate about the potential benefit of preimplantation {{genetic screening}}. Since FISH can analyze {{only a limited number of}} chromosomal loci, some of the embryos transferred might be diagnosed as ‘normal’ but in fact be aneuploid for one or more chromosomes not tested. Hence, genome-wide array comparative genome hybridization screening enabling aneuploidy detection of all chromosomes was thought to be a first step toward a better design. We recently showed array screening indeed enables accurate determination of the copy number state of all chromosomes in a single cell. Surprisingly, however, this genome-wide array screening revealed a much higher frequency and complexity of chromosomal aberrations in early embryos than anticipated, with imbalances in a staggering 90 % of all embryos. The mitotic error rate in cleavage stage embryos was proven to be higher than the <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> rate and as a consequence, the genome of a single blastomere is not representative for the genome of the other cells of the embryo. Hence, potentially viable embryos will be discarded upon screening a single blastomere. This observation provides a biological basis for the failure of the randomized clinical trials to increase baby-take-home rates using FISH on cleavage stage embroys...|$|E
40|$|During meiosis, DNA {{replication}} {{is followed}} by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and II), which give rise to genetically diverse haploid gametes. The prophase of the first meiotic division is highly regulated and alignment and synapsis of the homologous chromosomes during this stage are mediated by the synaptonemal complex. Incorrect assembly of the synaptonemal complex results in cell death, impaired <b>meiotic</b> recombination and <b>aneuploidy.</b> Oocytes with <b>meiotic</b> defects often survive the first meiotic prophase and give rise to aneuploid gametes. Similarly affected spermatocytes, on the other hand, almost always undergo apoptosis at a male-specific meiotic checkpoint, located specifically at epithelial stage IV during spermatogenesis. Many examples of this stage IV-specific arrest have been described for several genetic mouse models in which DNA repair or meiotic recombination are abrogated. Interestingly, in C. elegans, meiotic recombination and synapsis are monitored by two separate checkpoint pathways. Therefore we studied spermatogenesis in several knockout mice (Sycp 1 (-/-), Sycp 3 (-/-), Smc 1 beta(-/-) and Sycp 3 /Sycp 1 and Sycp 3 /Smc 1 beta double-knockouts) that are specifically defective in meiotic pairing and synapsis. Like for recombination defects, we found that all these genotypes also specifically arrest at epithelial stage IV. It seems that the epithelial stage IV checkpoint eliminates spermatocytes that fail a certain quality check, being either synapsis or DNA damage relate...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} genetic {{disorder}} in humans, trisomy, is caused predominantly by errors in chromosome segrega-tion during oogenesis. Isolated mouse oocytes resuming meiosis and progressing to metaphase II in vitro {{have recently been}} used to assess targets, aneugenic potential and sensitivity of oocytes to chemical exposures. In order to extend in vitro maturation tests to earlier stages of oogenesis, an in vitro assay with mouse preantral follicle cultures has been established. It permits the identi®cation of direct and also indirect effects of environmental chem-icals on the somatic compartment, the follicle and theca cells, {{that may lead to}} disturbances of oocyte growth, mat-uration and chromosome segregation. Early preantral fol-licles from prepubertal female mice are cultured in microdroplets for 12 days under strictly controlled condi-tions. The follicle-enclosed oocytes resume maturation, develop to metaphase II and become in vitro ovulated within 16 h after a physiological ovulatory stimulus with recombinant human gonadotrophins and epidermal growth factor. These oocytes grown and matured in vitro possess normal barrel-shaped spindles with well-aligned chromosomes. Their chromosomes segregate with high ®delity during anaphase I. The model aneugen colchicine induced a <b>meiotic</b> arrest and <b>aneuploidy</b> in these in vitro grown, follicle-enclosed oocytes in a dose-dependent man-ner, comparable to in vivo tests.

40|$|Background & objectives: Aneuploids are {{the most}} common {{chromosomal}} abnormality in liveborns and are usually the result of non-disjunction (NDJ) in meiosis. Copy number variations (CNVs) are large structural variations affecting the human genome. CNVs influence critical genes involved in causing NDJ by altering their copy number which affects the clinical outcome. In this study influence of CNVs on critical meiotic recombination was examined using new computational technologies to assess their role in causing aneuploidy. Methods: This investigation was based on the analysis of 12 random normal populations consisting of 1714 individuals for aneuploid causing genes under CNV effect. To examine the effect of CNVs on genes causing <b>aneuploidy,</b> <b>meiotic</b> recombination genes were analyzed using EnrichR, WebGestalt and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results: Forty three NDJ genes were found under CNV burden; IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis of CNV in meiotic recombination genes revealed a significant role of breast cancer gene 1, amyloid protein precursor, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nerve growth factor as key molecular players involved in causing aneuploidy. Interaction between these genes with other CNV-overlapping genes involved in cell cycle, recombination and meiosis might lead to increased incidences of aneuploidy. Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study implied that the effect of CNVs on normal genome contributed in amplifying the occurrences of chromosomal aneuploidies. The normal individuals consisting of variations in the susceptible genes causing aneuploids in the population remain undetected until the disorder genes express in the succeeding generations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: There is {{increasing}} concern {{that exposure to}} man-made substances that mimic endogenous hormones may adversely affect mammalian reproduction. Although a variety of reproductive complications have been ascribed to compounds with androgenic or estrogenic properties, {{little attention has been}} directed at the potential consequences of such exposures to the genetic quality of the gamete. Results: A sudden, spontaneous increase in meiotic disturbances, including aneuploidy, in studies of oocytes from control female mice in our laboratory coincided with the accidental exposure of our animals to an environmental source of bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is an estrogenic compound widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. We identified damaged caging material as the source of the exposure, as we were able to recapitulate the meiotic abnormalities by intentionally damaging cages and water bottles. In subsequent studies of female mice, we administered daily oral doses of BPA to directly test the hypothesis that low levels of BPA disrupt female meiosis. Our results demonstrated that the meiotic effects were dose dependent and could be induced by environmentally relevant doses of BPA. Conclusions: Both the initial inadvertent exposure and subsequent experimental studies suggest that BPA is a potent meiotic aneugen. Specifically, in the female mouse, short-term, low-dose exposure during the final stages of oocyte growth is sufficient to elicit detectable meiotic effects. These results provide the first unequivocal link between mammalian <b>meiotic</b> <b>aneuploidy</b> and an accidental environmental exposure and suggest that the oocyte and its meiotic spindle will provide a sensitive assay system for the study of reproductive toxins...|$|E
40|$|Meiotic {{chromosome}} segregation in human oocytes is notoriously error-prone, especially with ageing. Such errors markedly reduce the reproductive chances of {{increasing numbers of}} women embarking on pregnancy later in life. However, understanding the basis for these errors is hampered by limited access to human oocytes. Important new discoveries have arisen from molecular analyses of human female recombination and aneuploidy along with high-resolution analyses of human oocyte maturation and mouse models. Here, we review these findings to provide a contemporary picture of the key players choreographing {{chromosome segregation}} in mammalian oocytes and the cellular basis for errors. A search of PubMed was conducted using keywords including meiosis, oocytes, recombination, cohesion, cohesin complex, chromosome segregation, kinetochores, spindle, <b>aneuploidy,</b> <b>meiotic</b> cell cycle, spindle assembly checkpoint, anaphase-promoting complex, DNA damage, telomeres, mitochondria, female ageing and female fertility. We extracted papers focusing on mouse and human oocytes that best aligned with the themes of this review and that reported transformative and novel discoveries. Meiosis incorporates two sequential rounds of chromosome segregation executed by a spindle whose component microtubules bind chromosomes via kinetochores. Cohesion mediated by the cohesin complex holds chromosomes together and should be resolved at the appropriate time, in a specific step-wise manner and in conjunction with meiotically programmed kinetochore behaviour. In women, {{the stage is set}} for meiotic error even before birth when female-specific crossover maturation inefficiency leads to the formation of at-risk recombination patterns. In adult life, multiple co-conspiring factors interact with at-risk crossovers to increase the likelihood of mis-segregation. Available evidence support that these factors include, but are not limited to, cohesion deterioration, uncoordinated sister kinetochore behaviour, erroneous microtubule attachments, spindle instability and structural chromosomal defects that impact centromeres and telomeres. Data from mice indicate that cohesin and centromere-specific histones are long-lived proteins in oocytes. Since these proteins are pivotal for chromosome segregation, but lack any obvious renewal pathway, their deterioration with age provides an appealing explanation for {{at least some of the}} problems in older oocytes. Research in the mouse model has identified a number of candidate genes and pathways that are important for chromosome segregation in this species. However, many of these have not yet been investigated in human oocytes so it is uncertain at this stage to what extent they apply to women. The challenge for the future involves applying emerging knowledge of female meiotic molecular regulation towards improving clinical fertility management...|$|R
