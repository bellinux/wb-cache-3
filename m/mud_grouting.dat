40|$|Building with {{earth is}} one of the most ancient and {{traditional}} ways of building. Consequently, many historic and new-built earthen buildings can be found all over the world. However, the specific characteristics of earthen materials make the earth constructions very sensitive to external damaging agents. In particular, the weakness and fragility extensively recognized on earthen materials make this type of constructions very vulnerable from a structural perspective. In general, the structural damage on earth constructions occurs in the form of cracks, which debilitate the structural behaviour and compromise the durability. Injection of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> can be seen as a reliable and economic solution for repairing earth constructions. The success of such intervention on a historical construction requires following an appropriated design methodology. However, the knowledge about <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is still limited, and thus research efforts are needed in order to develop such methodology and to surpass many of the difficulties that the restorers of earth constructions are currently facing. Understanding the rheology of the <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> {{is one of}} the key issues of the all process. Hence, this paper explains an initial proposal of methodology for the design of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> and an experimental campaign that aimed to understand the role of the clay fraction in the rheology of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts.</b> Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, one {{fourth of}} the Worlds {{population}} lives in a house made from earth. Consequently, {{there is a large}} built stock widely distributed around the World going much beyond simple dwellings. An important part of the earth built stock is found often affected by cracking, whose repair is fundamental for the reestablishment of the structural integrity. However, the successful cracking repair of earthen walls requires employing adequate intervention techniques. With this respect, the injection of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is being put forward in the recent years and has been showing good results in the few reported cases. This thesis aims at contributing {{to the development of the}} limited knowledge on the injection technique applied to earth constructions. The broad extension of this topic led to selecting the injection of unmodified <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> (without mineral binders) in rammed earth constructions as case study. This thesis also intends contributing for the characterization of the rammed earth construction from southern Portugal and for the numerical simulation of its behaviour. An experimental program was defined and included the execution of a composition study about the behaviour of unmodified <b>mud</b> <b>grouts,</b> involving several variables of their composition and the characterization of important properties governing the injection technique. The design of a <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> has shown to require accounting for both the limitation of the clay content and the effect of the addition of a deflocculant. The experimental program continued with the suitability assessment of four soils from Alentejo (Portugal) for unstabilised rammed earth construction, and the selection of a representative soil used to manufacture medium- and large-scale rammed earth specimens. These specimens were used to assess the repair effectiveness of three different unmodified <b>mud</b> <b>grouts.</b> The results indicated that the injection of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is capable of attaining adequate repair effectiveness, providing that the same soil used in the construction is incorporated in the grout composition. Finally, the shear behaviour of rammed earth wallets tested under diagonal-compression was modelled resorting to the finite element method, where both the macro- and micro-modelling approaches were used. Both cases provided an adequate simulation of the non-linear shear behaviour, being highlighted the enhanced shear ductility of rammed earth. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A good {{condition}} of the structural elements of an earth construction is essential for a good global structural behaviour. Therefore, the absence of major cracks is essential. Repairing cracks by using traditional techniques, involving the partial or the total reconstructions of the structural elements, constitutes a very intrusive solution that must, necessarily, be avoided {{in the case of}} historical earth constructions. Grouting constitutes an alternative and more practical solution for solving this problem. However, the design of the grouts for earth constructions demands the implementation of a methodical process that accounts both for the structural and durability demands of the construction. Previous works showed that the injection of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is a reliable and feasible solution. However, the knowledge developed is still very limited, hindering the further development of a methodology for designing <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> for earth constructions. Therefore, in this paper an initial methodology proposal for the design of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is presented and discussed. This results from an ongoing research that aims at the development of suitable grouts for earth constructions. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
40|$|The {{region of}} Alentejo, in {{southern}} Portugal, holds an important heritage built in rammed earth. However, {{little is known}} about this heritage, which is often found in a relative advanced level of decay. The presence of cracks is a common damage and is responsible for debilitating the structural performance of these constructions, putting in risk their existence and the life of thousand of people. However, the preservation and conservations of this rammed earth heritage requires adopting compatible intervention solutions. With this respect, the repair of cracks by means of the injection of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> is a technique that has been showing great potential.

40|$|Earth constructions {{constitute}} {{an important and}} {{significant part of the}} World’s built heritage. This type of constructions shows also great presence in Portugal, specially, in the regions of Aveiro (Silveira et al. 2010), Alentejo and Algarve (Correia et al. 2007), despite that building in earth gradually felled into disuse during the last century. In these regions, the existing earth constructions are, however, found often extensively degraded and structurally damaged. The responsibility for this situation can be partially attributed to the systematic abandon of these buildings by the inhabitants, who leave them unprotected and without their required and essential maintenance. Nevertheless, there is, currently, lack of knowledge and of tools that would allow repairing and strengthening adequately this kind of buildings. Generating this knowledge and tools would aid opposing to the gradual disappearing of earth constructions, and eventually, lead to the reversing of this abandon tendency. Nowadays, grout injection is a feasible and a reliable solution to consolidate historical masonry structures. Nevertheless it requires a design methodology to be followed in order to result on a successful and adequate intervention, since the composition of the grout must fulfill requirements demanded by the construction, such as the compatibility between materials and the level of improvement of the structural behavior. In this context, years of practice and research {{led to the development of}} ternary grouts (composed by cement, lime and pozzolan) as an alternative to grouts based exclusively on cement or on organic resins, which have, in general, compatibility problems with historical masonry. On the other hand, the composition of ternary grouts is more similar to that of historical mortars, so they are expected to have improved compatibility. A similar analogy can be made for the case of grouting interventions on earth constructions. Thereby, a compatible grout would, necessarily, require the incorporation of earth in its composition (<b>mud</b> <b>grout).</b> Accordingly, some researchers and conservationists have already performed some tests and trials on <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> used for repairing cracks on adobe walls (e. g. : Vargas et al. 2008). They showed to be possible recovering, or even surpassing, the initial strength of the walls after repairing them through <b>grouting</b> with unstabilized <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> (without addition of mineral binders). Moreover, repairs with unstabilized <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> showed better mechanical performance than those with addition of cement and lime (Vargas et al. 2008). However, the knowledge about this type of grouts is still at an initial stage. Problems, such as the excessive shrinkage, the incapacity to inject smaller cracks and low fluidity, demand further research on the material and structural fields. In this context, the current PhD research aims at further developing the knowledge on <b>mud</b> <b>grouts,</b> by understanding their behavior as a repairing material and their effect/improvement on the structural behavior of earth constructions. Designing a <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> is a complex task, since its required properties are defined as function of characteristics of the earth construction. These properties must regard not only the structural behavior of the construction, but also the durability. Thus, the main properties that control the design of a <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> are: strength, fresh-state rheology, fresh-state stability, bond, chemical stability and microstructure. Since these properties are related between each other, adjusting the composition in order to improve one property has consequences on the others (Silva et al. 2010 a). In addition, the heterogeneity of the main component, which is earth, influences greatly the behavior of the <b>mud</b> <b>grout.</b> Therefore, it is extremely complex to design a grout without deeply knowing the components to be incorporated. Recent tests performed by the authors on aqueous suspensions of kaolin revealed that the clay fraction (size < 2 m) composing a <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> greatly influences its behavior during the fresh state (Silva et al. 2010 b). This fraction limits the fluidity of the <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> (rheologic behavior) due to its colloid behavior, which depends mainly on the particle size distribution and shape, clay mineralogy, and pH and ionic strength of the suspension. Nevertheless, non-purified clay particles tend to associate in aqueous suspension (pH close to neutral values and high ionic strength), forming a gel that opposes to the flowing (e. g. : Van Olphen 1977). As consequence, the <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> needs very high water content in order to reach adequate fluidity, which results on excessive drying shrinkage of the hardened grout. Reducing the clay fraction in the <b>mud</b> <b>grout</b> allows further decreasing the demand of water. Thus, the particle size distribution (PSD) of the solid phase can be corrected by adding coarse material. This material needs to be mainly constituted by particles with the size of the silt fraction (size between 60 and 2 m), in order to grant a stable suspension and thus avoid segregation and bleeding. Accordingly, the authors tested kaolin suspensions corrected with different percentages of limestone powder, which allowed, in fact, decreasing substantially the demand of water. Still, the water content was too high for a grout. Further improvement was achieved by adding little quantities of sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP), i. e., a deflocculant /dispersant for clays. The combined action of the addition of HMP and the correction of the PSD with limestone powder allowed decreasing the water content to values close to 30 %, and at the same time, obtaining fluid suspensions. Other properties, besides rheological parameters, were evaluated in a composition study, where the variables were the water content, the kaolin/limestone powder ratio and amount of added HMP. Such properties were the fresh state stability, the strength and the bond between the grout and earthen beams of small dimension. The results showed that the strength (flexural and compressive) of the grouts rather depends on the clay content, and the higher, the stronger is the grout. Regarding the bond, the tested grouts granted at least a recovery of 60 % of the original flexural strength of the earthen beams after being repaired. However, further investigation requires using larger specimens, since the earth used to prepare the beams was sieved to remove the particles larger than 2 mm, which resulted on flexural strength values higher than those of ordinary earthen materials. Further research is required at a macro-level. Thereby, the following step is to test the <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> applied to earth constructions walls. Thus, an experimental program is being prepared at the Civil Engineering Lab of University of Minho. Several adobe masonry and rammed earth walls are going to be tested under compression, diagonal compression and shear-compression, which will be subsequently repaired by grout injection, and then they will be retested. In advance, the composition of the grouts will be defined, based on the knowledge obtained from the previous studies. Later on, the selected grout compositions will be fully characterized. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Earth, as a {{building}} material, {{has been used}} since ancient times, and is still being used with that purpose. It was used for building shelters, houses, temples and even military constructions, like fortresses. As a consequence, currently, {{there is a great}} architectural heritage stock on this kind of constructions. Nevertheless, earthen materials are very sensitive when compared with modern materials, since they are more vulnerable to external aggressive agents, revealing most of the times a faster degradation rate. From a structural perspective they present a very low tensile strength, a low compressive strength and a fragile behaviour, making the earthen structures strongly vulnerable to earthquakes. The structural damage in this kind of structures manifests, in general, in the form of cracks or voids. Repairing these cracks is fundamental in order to obtain an improved structural behaviour, especially if the earth construction was built in a seismic zone. Injecting <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> may constitute a feasible and reliable solution for repair this kind of damage. Although, <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> experience many problems that hinder their application and the knowledge about them is still very limited. This requires that deep studies have to be carried out in order to solve their problems and to make this solution reliable. In this paper it is discussed the methodology that should be established for the design of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> suitable for earth constructions. But first a summarized explanation about earth constructions and their problems is presented.

40|$|Framework) The {{structural}} damage {{often found in}} earth constructions, can result from several factors and agents. Nevertheless, earthquakes are often object of great concern among the researchers dealing with this construction typology. In fact, strong earthquakes {{have a very high}} destructive effect on earth constructions, e. g. the complete destruction of Bam city, in Iran, during the 2003 earthquake, where adobe was the predominant construction typology. Several reasons contribute to the vulnerability of earth constructions, such as the low strength and fragility of the material and the overall high dead-weight. The fragile and weak connections are repeatedly appointed as the main reason for their collapse. Furthermore, their seismic behaviour problems are increased if the cracking is introduced by other decay agents, as for example, structural deficiencies and foundation settlements, are present. Cracking reduces the structure overall stiffness, especially if the cracks are localized in the connection between walls. In order to recover the initial stiffness of those constructions, repairing measures are required. Reconstruction of the damaged areas is an often applied solution. For new constructions this is a reliable solution. For historic constructions it is questionable because the identity of the construction can be deeply changed. Grouting can be used as an alternative repair solution for cracks in walls and damaged connections, on precondition that the compatibility of materials and durability are respected, since it is an irreversible solution. Therefore, <b>mud</b> based <b>grouts</b> seem to be the most suitable choice regarding these concerns. Moreover, grouting can also be used as complement of other strengthening solutions, like application of ties, and filling of voids and gaps in order to prevent further decay by, for example, water infiltration. (Background) In the literature concerning the conservation of earth constructions, studies and trials of <b>mud</b> based <b>grout</b> application for consolidation of earth constructions can be found. Nevertheless, the knowledge about these grouts is very limited. Therefore, <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> are still to be explored {{in order to have a}} proper design methodology developed. The reactivity to water of the active element of earth (clay) is a major drawback and brings great difficulties and problems to the grouts formulation, where five parameters are at stake: rheology, stability, shrinkage, strength and bond. The relationship between them has to be studied in order to allow the development of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> embracing the requirements that can lead to successful grouting interventions, and to access their limitations. (Paper objectives) This paper aims, in general, to contribute for the development of compatible grouts for the repairing of Earth constructions. It will present the first results of an ongoing experimental research concerned mainly with the study of the grouts rheology, and bond development between the grout and the original materials. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Southern Portugal {{presents}} a rich heritage constituted by several constructions made from unstabilised rammed earth (URE), which {{are threatened by}} several factors, ranging from lack of conservation to a non-negligible seismic hazard. These threatens are enhanced {{by the fact that}} {{little is known about the}} shear behaviour of URE constructions. The preservation of this heritage requires definitely the development of this knowledge and, in addition, the development of adequate intervention solutions. This paper {{presents a}}n experimental program where the shear behaviour of URE is assessed by means of diagonal compression tests on representative wallet-specimens. Furthermore, the use of <b>mud</b> <b>grouts</b> in repairing cracks was also assessed. The results showed that the shear behaviour of URE depends on the binding capacity promoted by the clay fraction and on the friction and interlocking promoted by the coarse aggregates. The repair by injection was shown to promote satisfactory shear strength recovery of the specimens, but was less effective in recovering the initial shear stiffness.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} possibilities of using red mud, a waste product derived from the digestion of bauxite with a versatile mineralogical composition, as additive in concrete, grout mortar and cement paste. Two types of red mud from China were used in the experiments. Concrete in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the compressive strength and dry shrinkage of concrete. Grout mortars in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the flexural and compressive strengths, dry shrinkage and water permeability of mortar. Cement paste in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the capacity of Cs adsorption and ionic leaching. The results show that addition of red mud does not contribute to nor impair the strength of the concrete or grout mortar but instead acts as inert filler. The decrease in compressive strength of concrete with addition of red mud is mainly due to the increased water-cement ratio. There is no significant increase in dry shrinkage of concrete with addition of red mud, but there is a certain increase in dry shrinkage of grout mortar, especially when more than 20 % of the binder is replaced by red mud. Addition of red <b>mud</b> in <b>grout</b> mortar significantly increases the water permeability of the mortar due to the increased water-cement ratio. Owing to the fluctuant results from the adsorption test, it is difficult to draw a conclusion of the adsorption capacity for Cs by addition of red mud in concrete. However, the preliminary results from a quick adsorption test indicated a good adsorption behavior of cement with the addition of red mud, especially at a low initial Cs concentration...|$|R
