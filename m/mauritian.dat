5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct <b>Mauritian</b> birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the <b>Mauritian</b> shelduck, the <b>Mauritian</b> duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct <b>Mauritian</b> reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the <b>Mauritian</b> giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small <b>Mauritian</b> flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, {{is used as a}} watermark on all <b>Mauritian</b> rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the <b>Mauritian</b> immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{based on}} remains {{collected}} by Louis Etienne Thirioux {{in the early}} 20th century, the English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil <b>Mauritian</b> parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni. In 2007, {{on the basis of}} a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's grey parrot. In 1967, James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey <b>Mauritian</b> parrots referred to the broad-billed parrot.|$|E

5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct <b>Mauritian</b> duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius and Réunion were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the <b>Mauritian</b> shelduck, the <b>Mauritian</b> duck, and the Mauritius night heron. On Réunion, it lived alongside the Réunion ibis, the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Réunion became extinct after {{the arrival of}} man and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Réunion ibis, the Réunion parakeet, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink.

5|$|The park's fauna {{includes}} notably several endemic {{bird species}}, such as Barau's petrel, the Réunion harrier, and the Réunion cuckooshrike. In total, 18 bird species are found at Réunion, {{half of which}} are endemic. At least 22 bird species have already gone extinct since human colonisation. A major threat to the bird fauna are introduced cats and rats. Of mammals, the <b>Mauritian</b> flying fox recolonised the Réunion after going extinct from the island. Notable butterfly species include Papilio phorbanta and Salamis augustina, and an endemic reptile is the Reunion Island day gecko.|$|E

5|$|The travel {{journal of}} the Dutch ship Gelderland (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, {{contains}} the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They {{have been attributed to}} the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct <b>Mauritian</b> birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern <b>Mauritian</b> birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|The South-West Indian Ocean {{is located}} within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa's east coast and 90°E and is {{primarily}} monitored by the Meteo France's La Reunion RSMC, while the <b>Mauritian,</b> Australian Indonesian, and Malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it. Until {{the start of the}} 1985–86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80°E, with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90E considered {{to be a part of}} the Australian region. On average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms, while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon. The tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various Indian Ocean island nations and or various countries along Africa's east coast.|$|E

5000|$|Mauritius (Moris in Créole), {{formerly}} the Isle of France and Île Maurice in French, {{is the main}} island {{of the nation of}} Mauritius. It is located in the southwest of the Indian Ocean, {{in the heart of the}} Mascarene Islands, between Réunion to the west and Rodrigues to the east. The population is approximately 1.2 million inhabitants and is divided into several communities. The majority of <b>Mauritians</b> are crossbred with Indian (65.8% [...] ) or Creole or mestizo (27.7%) origins. There is also a minority of mulattoes, [...] "white Mauritius" [...] (2%), and Sino-Mauritians (3%). Muslim <b>Mauritians</b> are either Indian or Arab-Indian origin.|$|R

5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}} {{was kept}} as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius, {{and although the}} bird was becoming scarcer, a number of specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed {{a wide variety of}} food, such as bananas, potatoes, and chayote, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the <b>Mauritian</b> population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The two {{assigned}} Necropsittacus {{species have}} since become {{the source of}} much taxonomic confusion, and their identities have been debated. N. borbonicus later received common names such as Réunion red and green parakeet or Réunion parrot, and N. francicus {{has been called the}} <b>Mauritian</b> parrot. The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka recognised N. borbonicus in 1953, and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by Dubois and the body-plan of the Rodrigues parrot. He did not find the naming of N. francicus to have been necessary, but expressed hope more evidence would be found. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that N. borbonicus may have been an escaped pet lory seen by Dubois, since 16th century Dutch paintings show the somewhat similar East Indian chattering lory (Lorius garrulus), presumably in captivity. However, Greenway was unable to find any references that matched those Rothschild had given for N. francicus.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the <b>Mauritian</b> Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E
