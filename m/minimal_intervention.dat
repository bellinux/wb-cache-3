Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age.

Aim: To systematically review randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> to reduce the long-term use of BZDs in primary care. Design and setting: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in UK general practices. Method: Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and Embase (1967 - 2010) were searched for trials of <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> (such as a single letter or one consultation from a GP) for patients in primary care with long-term (3 ̆e 3 months) BZD use.

40|$|Treatment {{strategies}} for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine usage {{can be divided}} into <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> and gradual discontinuation programs. <b>Minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> invite patients to quit their long-term benzodiazepine usage on their own by making them aware of the adverse effects. This type of intervention is successful in about one fifth of patients. Gradual discontinuation programs are more extensive interventions in order to help those patients who are unable to discontinue benzodiazepine use on their own. These programs are successful in two-thirds of the patients and can be combined with additional pharmacological or psychological treatment. Once the withdrawal symptoms have diminished, most patients have an improved psychological functioning compared to when they were using benzodiazepines. Furthermore, no increase in medical consumption has been found...|$|R

40|$|Background. There are {{significant}} barriers to accessing effective psychological therapy {{in primary care}} resulting {{from a lack of}} suitably trained therapists to meet current demand. More efficient service delivery using <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> (such as bibliotherapy) provided by paraprofessional therapists may be one method of overcoming these problems, and is the subject of attention in the UK and elsewhere. A randomized trial was conducted to test the clinical effectiveness of this model. Assistant psychologists delivered a guided self-help intervention to patients with anxiety and depression who were currently waiting for psychological therapy. Method. A total of 114 patients were randomized either to guided self-help or a waiting-list control group. All patients were followed up 3 months later, prior to starting conventional psychological therapy. Measures included self-reported adherence to the intervention, anxiety and depressive symptoms, social functioning and patient satisfaction. Results. Adherence to the guided self-help intervention was acceptable and patients reported satisfaction with the intervention. However, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in anxiety and depression symptoms at 3 months. Conclusions. The results demonstrate that this model of guided self-help did not provide additional benefit to patients on a waiting list for psychological therapy. The results are considered in the context of possible internal and external validity threats, and compared with previous trials of <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions.</b> The implications of the results for the design of future <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> are considered...|$|R
