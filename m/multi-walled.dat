5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multi-walled</b> {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) {{consist of}} multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models {{that can be}} used to describe the structures of <b>multi-walled</b> nanotubes. In the Russian Doll model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the Parchment model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in <b>multi-walled</b> nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{strength}} of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa. This limitation has been recently addressed by applying high-energy electron irradiation, which crosslinks inner shells and tubes, and effectively increases {{the strength}} of these materials to ≈60 GPa for <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes and ≈17 GPa for double-walled carbon nanotube bundles. CNTs {{are not nearly as}} strong under compression. Because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio, they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive, torsional, or bending stress.|$|E

25|$|The {{strength}} and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests {{they will have}} an important role in nanotechnology engineering. The highest tensile strength of an individual <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotube has been tested to be 63GPa. Carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century, possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it. Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (>1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricated macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes as building blocks. These scaffolds possess macro-, micro-, and nano- structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications. These 3D all-carbon scaffolds/architectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage, supercapacitors, field emission transistors, high-performance catalysis, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices and implants.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{also called}} buckytubes, are carbon molecules with a cylindrical nanostructure. They have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphene. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, {{and the combination}} of chiral angle and radius controls properties such as electrical conductivity, electrolyte wettability and ion access. Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or <b>multi-walled</b> nanotubes (MWNTs). The latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian matryoshka dolls. SWNTs have diameters ranging between 1 and 3nm. MWNTs have thicker coaxial walls, separated by spacing (0.34nm) that is close to graphene's interlayer distance.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E
25|$|Nanoparticle-Assisted PCR (nanoPCR): In recent years, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that some nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the efficiency of PCR (thus being called nanoPCR), and some even perform better than the original PCR enhancers. It was also found that quantum dots (QDs) can improve PCR specificity and efficiency. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are efficient in enhancing the amplification of long PCR. Carbon nanopowder (CNP) was reported be able to improve the efficiency of repeated PCR and long PCR. ZnO, TiO2, and Ag NPs were also found to increase PCR yield. Importantly, already known data has indicated that non-metallic NPs retained acceptable amplification fidelity. Given that many NPs are capable of enhancing PCR efficiency, it is clear that there is likely to be great potential for nanoPCR technology improvements and product development.|$|E

Nanotube research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries by Bethune at IBM and Iijima at NEC of single-walled carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transition-metal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge. The arc discharge technique was well-known to produce the famed Buckminster fullerene on a preparative scale, and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes. The {{discovery of}} nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness {{of the scientific community}} as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Mesa Verdean villages thrived {{during the}} mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects {{constructed}} massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built {{during this period}} {{have been described as}} [...] "among the world's greatest archaeological treasures". Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and <b>multi-walled</b> structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought. At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there. The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260. Most {{of the people in the}} region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo, near Cortez, Colorado. Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature: both [...] "-wall" [...] and [...] "-walled" [...] are being used in combination with [...] "single", [...] "double", [...] "triple" [...] or [...] "multi", and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation; for example, <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotube (MWNT).|$|E

2500|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are {{the strongest}} and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp2 bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a <b>multi-walled</b> carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of [...] (For illustration, this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to [...] on a cable with cross-section of [...]) Further studies, such as one conducted in 2008, revealed that individual CNT shells have strengths of up to ≈, which is in agreement with quantum/atomistic models. Since carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of 1.3 to 1.4g/cm3, its specific strength of up to 48,000kN·m·kg−1 {{is the best of}} known materials, compared to high-carbon steel's 154kN·m·kg−1.|$|E
2500|$|Aligned <b>multi-walled</b> carbon {{nanotube}} (MWNT) {{growth has been}} used in CNT film synthesis through the domino effect. In this process, [...] "forests" [...] of MWNTs are pushed flat in a single direction, compressing their vertical orientation into the horizontal plane, which results in the formation of high-purity buckypaper with no further purification or treatment required. By comparison, when a buckypaper sample was formed from the 1 ton compression of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) generated MWNT powder, any application of a solvent led to the immediate swelling of the film till it reverted into particulate matter. It appears that for the CNT powder used, compression alone was insufficient to generate robust buckypaper and highlights that the aligned growth methodology generates in situ tube-tube interactions not found in CVD CNT powder and are preserved through to the domino pushing formation of buckypaper.|$|E
