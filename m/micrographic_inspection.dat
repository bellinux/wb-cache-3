40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Aerospace Engineering Department (DIAS) at Federico II University of Naples aiming to evaluate the feasibility {{and the performance of}} an electrically heated composite leading edge for anti-icing and de-icing applications. A 283 [mm] chord NACA 0012 airfoil prototype was designed, manufactured and equipped with an High Temperature composite leading edge with embedded Ni-Cr heating element. The heating element was fed by a DC power supply unit and the average power densities supplied to the leading edge were ranging 1. 0 to 30. 0 [kW m- 2]. The present investigation focused on thermal tests experimentally performed under fixed icing conditions with zero AOA, Mach= 0. 2, total temperature of - 20 [°C], liquid water content LWC= 0. 6 [g m- 3] and average mean volume droplet diameter MVD= 35 [µm]. These fixed conditions represented the top icing performance of the Icing Flow Facility (IFF) available at DIAS and therefore it has represented the “sizing design case” for the tested prototype. An analytical model has been also developed both for the preliminary sizing and test guidance. Running wet and fully evaporative functional modes have been verified both analytically and experimentally with reasonable agreement. A room temperature thermal endurance test has been run for 104 cycles with max thermal load representative of 1. 5 times the max temperature experienced within the leading edge in fully evaporative conditions aiming to verify the integrity of the composite laminate after the imposed thermal stress through <b>micrographic</b> <b>inspection.</b> The achieved results, despite obtained under limited icing conditions imposed by the IFF wind tunnel, showed great potentialities for the proposed Icing Protection System named EHCLE (Electrical Heated Composite Leading Edge) which has been constantly working below 60 % of its maximum operative temperatures under the given icing conditions and the explored power densities. This potentiality justify the need for future development in a larger scale under more severe icing condition for a final assessment about the applicability of such Icing Protection System to real aircrafts...|$|E
40|$|Conventional” or {{certified}} repair {{procedures for}} composite structures (i. e. patches) are usually time-consuming, performed by highly qualified staff and seem immoderate regarding {{the most common}} damage found in aeronautics due to low energy impact. A cost-effective and simple repair method based on liquid resin infiltration in the induced crack net is proposed. An analytical model based on damage geometry and physical chemistry properties, is developed to verify the resin infiltration capabilities. An experimental protocol has been developed to identify those properties with conditions similar to the infiltration process (roughness, temperature, [...] .). An experimental set up has been manufactured and different configurations (injection pressure level, infiltration resin toughness [...] .) are studied. Non destructive testing, like ultrasonic inspection, combined to <b>micrographic</b> <b>inspection</b> show good experimental infiltration capabilities. To initiate the validation procedure of this repair, {{the second part of}} this work deals with the mechanical behaviour and strength of the repair with experimental tests campaign. Numerical models are used for analysis and understanding. Two different scales are considered at interface (material) and structural level. Fracture Mechanics tests are performed with classical tests such as DCB or ENF, and a new original one, Tensile Flexure test on Notched Specimen (TFNS test), to characterize and identify the repaired interface properties. For their severity regarding composite materials behaviour, both CAI and re-indentation (in-plane and out-of-plane solicitation representative of real loading conditions) were performed on repaired samples. Those complementary tests show that this infiltration repair method restores mechanical properties when proper toughened resins are used. Ces travaux ont pour objectif de proposer une réparation de mise en œuvre simple et adaptée au défaut sur matériaux composites de type « impact faible énergie » très courant au sein des structures aéronautiques. Une méthode d'infiltration de résine dans le dommage est proposée. Après une étude analytique du principe, un banc d'essai a été réalisé pour valider la capacité d'infiltration évaluée notamment par CND. Dans un deuxième temps, une démarche globale (numérique et expérimentale) de validation mécanique des réparations composites est mise en place. Des essais classiques et plus originaux sont proposés pour l'analyse de la ténacité de l'interface réparée à l'échelle du matériau (DCB, ENF, Traction rainurée) puis à une échelle représentative de structure (CAI, re-poinçonnement) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} of veneering ceramics {{is influenced by}} many factors. Some of them cause cracks and residual stress already during the manufacture of veneered fixed partial dentures. It is claimed that the repair material Denseo Fee (Denseo GmbH, Aschaffenburg, Germany) closes defects and increases the mechanical properties of the glass ceramic. In order to study the repairing properties of the Denseo Fee material, the flexural strength, hardness and fracture toughness were studied. The Glazing material VITA Glaze (VITA GmbH, Bad Säckingen, Germany) {{was used as a}} reference material. It was also tested, if there were any differences in the mechanical properties caused by the thickness of the veneering layer and framework material. In this study, 85 zirconium dioxide and cobalt-chromium-molybdenum plates were veneered with 0, 5, 1 and 2 mm VITA ceramic. The mechanical parameters were determined before and after repairing. By using the three-point bending test the veneering layer was cracked. The repair includes the coating with Denseo Fee and VITA Glaze and the firing according to the manufactures instructions. To evaluate the penetration depth of the repair material, some of the samples were mounted in resin and sawn into thin wafers. The macroscopic examination of the repaired specimens showed an intact, homogeneous surface. The <b>micrographic</b> <b>inspection</b> revealed that there was a complete confusion of the veneering ceramic and the repair material in the upper third. In the deep layer and at the interface the fracture gap was still open. The comparison of the flexural strength, hardness and fracture toughness of the metal-ceramic specimens showed no significant difference before and after repairing with Denseo Fee. After repairing the all-ceramic samples there has been a significant reduction of the fracture toughness, concerning the hardness and the flexural strength no significant differences were found. The comparison of the repair results from Denseo Fee and VITA Glaze showed no significant difference. With the increase in the thickness of the veneering layer, hardness, flexural strength and fracture toughness of all specimens tended to decrease. The highest values were found in 0, 5 and 1 mm layer thickness, up to 2 mm veneer ceramic there was a sharp decrease. Compared to the metal-ceramic, the zirconium dioxide framework specimens showed more chippings of the veneering ceramic, complete veneer fractures and variations in the mechanical properties. The connection between the crack depth and the penetrating capacity of Denseo Fee shows that there is only the possibility to repair superficial cracks or thin ceramic layers. Consequently it is not possible at the moment to give a reliable statement about an increase or decrease concerning the toughness of the specimens after repair, as other factors like the veneering thickness and bond between the framework and the veneer ceramic have a decisive influence on the result...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of experiments conducted in order to identify and locate the failure initiation in glass fiber/epoxy laminates with integrated structural health monitoring sensors (SHM) and electronics. Recent advances in health monitoring technologies have resulted in the development of micro-dimensional devices that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small size, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded inclusion is, in fact, one of the main concerns in smart structures technology. To address this specific issue, unidirectional S 2 glass fiber/epoxy laminated composites are fabricated with embedded small implants that mimic potential sensors and microprocessors. Quasi-static tensile tests are then performed on those samples while monitoring them by the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Additionally, the microstructure of the material with and without implants is explored. The AE results show that early low-medium amplitude events are detected at the implant location and the <b>micrographic</b> <b>inspections</b> reveal that micro-cracks initiate at the device-composite matrix interface and grow around the implant causing the debond of the external component from the surrounding resin system.
