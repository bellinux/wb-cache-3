2500|$|The Obama {{administration}} inherited several government surveillance {{programs from}} the Bush administration, and Obama attempted {{to strike a}} balance between protecting civil liberties and tracking terrorist threats, but Obama's continuation of many programs disappointed many civil libertarians. The New York Times reported in 2009 that the NSA had been intercepting communications of American citizens including a Congressman, although the Justice Department believed that the NSA had corrected its errors. In 2011, Obama signed a four-year extension of some provisions of the Patriot Act. In June 2013 the existence of PRISM, a clandestine mass electronic surveillance data mining program operated by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) since 2007, was leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of <b>mass</b> <b>data</b> collection was far greater than the public knew. In the face of international outrage, U.S. government officials defended the PRISM surveillance program by asserting it could not be used on domestic targets without a warrant, that it helped to prevent acts of terrorism, and that it received independent oversight from the federal government's executive, judicial and legislative branches. In June 2013, Obama stated that the NSA's data gathering practices constitute [...] "a circumscribed, narrow system directed at us being able to protect our people." [...] In 2015, Obama signed the USA Freedom Act, which extended several provisions of the Patriot Act but ended the collection of bulk telephone records by the NSA.|$|E

The comparative analyses of <b>mass</b> spectrometry <b>data</b> of microbial communities {{at the molecular level}} is difficult to perform, especially {{in the context of a}} host.

The informatics based techniques to visualize and organize datasets are well established for metagenome sequencing; however, due to the scarcity of informatics strategies in mass spectrometry, it is currently difficult to cross correlate two very different <b>mass</b> spectrometry <b>data</b> sets from microbial communities and their hosts. We highlight that molecular networking can be used as an organizational tool of tandem <b>mass</b> spectrometry <b>data,</b> automated database search for rapid identification of metabolites, and as a workflow to manage and compare <b>mass</b> spectrometry <b>data</b> from complex mixtures of organisms.

5000|$|GFS was {{designed}} by Michael C. Giddings (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) et al., and released in 2003. Giddings expanded the algorithms for GFS from earlier ideas. Two papers were published in 1993 explaining the techniques used to identify proteins in sequence databases. These methods determined the mass of peptides using mass spectrometry, and then used the mass to search protein databases to identify the proteins [...] In 1999 a more complex program was released called Mascot that integrated three types of protein/database searches: peptide molecular weights, tandem mass spectrometry from one or more peptide, and combination <b>mass</b> <b>data</b> with amino acid sequence. The fallback with this widely used program {{is that it is}} unable to detect alternative splice sites that are not currently annotated, and it not usually able to find proteins that have not been annotated. Giddings built upon these sources to create GFS which would compare peptide <b>mass</b> <b>data</b> to entire genomes to identify the proteins. Giddings system is able to find new annotations of genes that have not been found, such as undocumented genes and undocumented alternative splice sites.|$|E
