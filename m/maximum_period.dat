5|$|The Canadian {{province}} of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The <b>maximum</b> <b>period</b> between general elections {{of the assembly}} is five years, but the Lieutenant Governor is able to call one at any time. However, the Premier has typically asked the Lieutenant Governor to call the election in {{the fourth or fifth}} year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (<b>maximum</b> <b>period</b> of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of <b>maximum</b> <b>period</b> for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the <b>maximum</b> <b>period</b> is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of varying the <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> between {{consecutive}} ambulatory bouts in community-based outcomes. Ambulation was assessed in 97 community-dwelling older adults (mean (SD) age 69. 2 (7. 7) years) using an accelerometer (activPAL™) worn on the upper thigh for 7 consecutive days. The volume, pattern and variability of ambulation were calculated over a range of <b>maximum</b> resting <b>periods</b> (1 – 30 s). Outcomes with a <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> from 1 to 6 s did not vary due to device functionality. Non-linear regression (power law, r 2 > 0. 99) showed that increasing the <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> from 6 to 30 s resulted in changes in volume (increased duration spent walking, and decreased number of bouts), variability (S 2 increased) and pattern (α decreased), and a linear relationship with an increase in average bout length. With a MRP of 6 s, 6 % of the cohort achieved the public health guidelines of 150 min of ambulation/week accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min, which increased to 40 % using a <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> of 30 s. Modifying the <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> impacts on volume, pattern and variability measures of community based ambulation, and attainment of public health guidelines. This highlights the need for standardised algorithms to aid interpretation and explicit reporting of the <b>maximum</b> resting <b>period</b> to aid comparison between studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAims. This study aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the occurrence and origin of grand solar maxima and minima. Methods. We first investigate the statistics of peaks and dips simultaneously occurring in the solar modulation potentials reconstructed using the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) 10 Be and IntCal 13 14 C records for the overlapping time period spanning between ~ 1650 AD to 6600 BC. Based on the distribution of these events, we propose a method to identify grand minima and <b>maxima</b> <b>periods.</b> By using waiting time distribution analysis, we investigate the nature of grand minima and <b>maxima</b> <b>periods</b> identified based on the criteria as well as the variance and significance of the Hale cycle during these kinds of events throughout the Holocene epoch. Results. Analysis of grand minima and maxima events occurring simultaneously in the solar modulation potentials, reconstructed based on the 14 C and the 10 Be records, shows that the majority of events characterized by periods of moderate activity levels tend to last less than 50 years: grand <b>maxima</b> <b>periods</b> do not last longer than 100 years, while grand minima can persist slightly longer. The power and the variance of the 22 -year Hale cycle increases during grand maxima and decreases during grand minima, compared to periods characterized by moderate activity levels. Conclusions. We present the first reconstruction of the occurrence of grand solar maxima and minima during the Holocene based on simultaneous changes in records of past solar variability derived from tree-ring 14 C and ice-core 10 Be, respectively. This robust determination of the occurrence of grand solar minima and <b>maxima</b> <b>periods</b> will enable systematic investigations of the influence of grand solar minima and maxima episodes on Earth’s climate...|$|R
