The movements involved in gymnastics {{contribute to the}} development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest and abdominal muscle groups. Alertness, precision, daring, self-confidence and self-discipline are mental traits that can also be developed through gymnastics. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.|$|E

Practices such as Shut Chakra Bedhana (piercing the chakras) and Yoni Mudra Japa are included. That sadhana used as the Vairāgī Vaiṣṇavas practice does not have a sexual component.|$|E

25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why men tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E

500|$|A 2005 study {{reported}} that, among {{a sample of}} undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources for knowledge about the clitoris were school and friends, {{and that this was}} associated with the least amount of tested knowledge.

500|$|A static, frontal {{image is}} typical of {{religious}} images intended for worship. Symmetric compositions are common in Mesopotamian art when the context is not narrative. Many examples have been found on cylinder seals. Three-part arrangements of a god and two other figures are common, but five-part arrangements exist as well. In this respect, the relief follows established conventions. In terms of representation, the deity is sculpted with a naturalistic but [...] "modest" [...] nudity, reminiscent of Egyptian goddess sculptures, which are sculpted with a well-defined navel and pubic region but no details; there, the lower hemline of a dress indicates that some covering is intended, {{even if it does}} not conceal. In a typical statue of the genre, Pharao Menkaura and two goddesses, Hathor and Bat are shown in human form and sculpted naturalistically, just as in the Burney Relief; in fact, Hathor has been given the features of Queen KhamerernebtyII (see image and article). Depicting an anthropomorphic god as a naturalistic human is an innovative artistic idea that may well have diffused from Egypt to Mesopotamia, just like a number of concepts of religious rites, architecture, the [...] "banquet plaques", and other artistic innovations previously. In this respect, the Burney Relief shows a clear departure from the schematic style of the worshiping <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> were found in temples from periods about 500 years earlier (see image). It is also distinct from the next major style in the region: Assyrian art, with its rigid, detailed representations, mostly of scenes of war and hunting (see image).|$|E

500|$|Donen {{solidified}} his solo {{career and}} scored another {{hit with the}} musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét, the film had music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd. Jane Powell plays Milly, an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam (Howard Keel) only hours after meeting him. When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods, Milly discovers that her husband's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish. She makes it her mission to domesticate them and, upon Milly's sarcastic suggestion, the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them. The film {{was shot in the}} new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences, particularly the [...] "barn raising scene" [...] in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics' 10 Best Films lists. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture), which it won. Its success was a surprise to MGM, which had invested more money in two of its other 1954 musicals: Rose Marie and Brigadoon, starring Kelly. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was more profitable than either of its rivals, as well as On the Town and Singin' in the Rain, and its success was a major turning point for Donen's career. The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose, who described it as anti-woman, calling it [...] "one of the most repulsive movies about <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> has ever been made" [...] and a musical about rape.|$|E

2500|$|... 19th-century feminists {{reacted to}} {{cultural}} inequities including the pernicious, widespread {{acceptance of the}} Victorian image of women's [...] "proper" [...] role and [...] "sphere." [...] The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of [...] "separate spheres" [...] for <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children). This [...] "feminine ideal," [...] also called [...] "The Cult of Domesticity," [...] was typified in Victorian conduct books such as Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management and Sarah Stickney Ellis's books. The Angel in the House (1854) and El ångel del hogar, bestsellers by Coventry Patmore and Maria del Pilar Sinués de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal. Queen Victoria herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the [...] "mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights".|$|E

[...] The dissent views the injunction as violating SFAA's First Amendment rights. The dissent noted, [...] "Here, the SFAA intended, by use of the word 'Olympic', to promote a realistic image of homosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> would help them move into the mainstream of their communities." [...] Preventing the SFAA from calling its games the [...] "Gay Olympics" [...] prevents the SFAA from expressing this idea.
