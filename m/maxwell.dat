5|$|Edwin <b>Maxwell</b> {{was born}} on July 16, 1825 in Weston, Virginia (present-day West Virginia). He {{was the son of}} Levi <b>Maxwell</b> and his wife Sarah Haymond <b>Maxwell.</b> Through his father, he was a {{grandson}} of Thomas and Jane Lewis <b>Maxwell</b> and was of English and Scottish ancestry. Through his mother, he was the grandson of Col. John Haymond and Mary Wilson Haymond. <b>Maxwell</b> had five siblings: Angelica, John, Rufus, Semira, and Jane.

5|$|<b>Maxwell</b> {{was born}} in 1825 in Weston, Virginia (present-day West Virginia) and raised on a farm {{until the age of}} 21. Despite his father's plans for him to become a carpenter, <b>Maxwell</b> studied {{jurisprudence}} under his uncle Lewis <b>Maxwell,</b> a U.S. Representative. <b>Maxwell</b> was admitted to the bar in 1848, and relocated to West Union, where he served two terms as the Commonwealth's attorney for Doddridge County. In 1857, <b>Maxwell</b> moved to Clarksburg and established a law partnership with Burton Despard, which was later joined by Nathan Goff, Jr.|$|E

5|$|After {{mourning}} her death, Jude {{leads the}} party to meet <b>Maxwell</b> and attempts {{to persuade him to}} dispel the barrier and save Elympios. Reunited with Milla, who has been reborn as a spirit, they convince <b>Maxwell</b> of their cause. However, Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal <b>Maxwell</b> within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; <b>Maxwell</b> sends {{the party to}} Elympios before he is completely subdued. There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits. With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. <b>Maxwell</b> dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as <b>Maxwell,</b> and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.|$|E
5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in <b>Maxwell</b> assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except <b>Maxwell.</b> Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, <b>Maxwell</b> captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, <b>Maxwell</b> led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, <b>Maxwell</b> dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E

Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and <b>Maxwell</b> closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at <b>Maxwell,</b> begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until <b>Maxwell</b> translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E

5|$|<b>Maxwell</b> was {{admitted}} to the Harrison County bar on June 1, 1848 and began to practice law soon after. During the early years of his legal career, he provided legal services in Braxton, Gilmer, Lewis, and Upshur counties. He relocated to Doddridge County in 1852 and established a law practice in West Union. While practicing in West Union, he served two terms as the Commonwealth's attorney for Doddridge County. <b>Maxwell</b> was named as an authorized superintendent to receive capital stock when the assembly permitted the establishment of a bank branch in West Union on March 15, 1856 and March 27, 1858. <b>Maxwell,</b> seeking to expand his law practice, and wanting greater opportunities for advancement, moved to Clarksburg in 1857, where he established a law partnership with Burton Despard creating the law practice of Despard and <b>Maxwell.</b> Despard and <b>Maxwell</b> offered their legal services to clients in Doddridge, Harrison, Lewis, Ritchie, and Taylor counties. In 1865, Nathan Goff, Jr. joined their law partnership, after which it was known as Despard, <b>Maxwell,</b> and Goff. Goff later became a United States Circuit Judge and served as a United States Senator from West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, <b>Maxwell,</b> and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when <b>Maxwell</b> was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. <b>Maxwell</b> {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues that faced <b>Maxwell</b> and the justices primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E
