40|$|Abstract. The {{normal stress}} {{distributed}} in the mid-bondline of the adhesively bonded joint under cleavage loading was investigated using the elastic finite element method (FEM) and the strain gauges method to reveal the real normal stresses distribution in the <b>metal-to-metal</b> <b>joint</b> while the load was increased. The results from the finite element analysis (FEA) showed that {{there is always a}} peak stress of the normal stress Sy in the mid-bondline occurred at a point close to the loading pin axis. When the load was increased from 0. 5 kN to 3 kN, there was also a point located at about x = 16 mm along the length of specimen where there is without any normal stress at all. The result of stress Sy from the FEA is nearly the same as that one obtained from the strain gauges method. It was also found that there was a evidently hardness change in the bonded zone of the adherend made from structural steel or pure copper, which can be used to explain the procedure of the joint and discuss the distribution model of the normal stress Sy in the joint under the cleavage loading...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} structural epoxy [Super Koropon (or equivalent) ] {{has been}} found to be a suitable filler material for bolted joints that are required to have large thermal conductances. The contact area of such a joint can be less than 1 percent of the apparent joint area, the exact value depending on the roughnesses of the mating surfaces. By occupying the valleys between contact peaks, the filler widens the effective cross section for thermal conduction. In comparison with prior thermal joint-filler materials, the present epoxy offers advantages of stability, ease of application, and [...] as a byproduct of its stability [...] lasting protection against corrosion. Moreover, unlike silicone greases that have been used previously, this epoxy does not migrate to contaminate adjacent surfaces. Because this epoxy in its uncured state wets metal joint surfaces and has low viscosity, it readily flows to fill the gaps between the mating surfaces: these characteristics affect the overall thermal conductance of the joint more than does the bulk thermal conductivity of the epoxy, which is not exceptional. The thermal conductances of <b>metal-to-metal</b> <b>joints</b> containing this epoxy were found to range between 5 and 8 times those of unfilled joints...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{relates to}} the {{numerical}} prediction of the mode I failure of <b>metal-to-metal</b> adhesive <b>joints</b> under quasi-static, steady-state conditions {{by means of a}} criterion based on attaining a critical value of the maximum principal stress at a critical distance ahead of the crack tip. The model accurately predicts the failure of three adhesives (i) over a wide range of the thickness of the adhesive layer from 0. 1 to 1 mm, and (ii) for two very different test geometries: namely the linear elastic fracture-mechanics tapered double-cantilever beam test and the elastic–plastic fracture-mechanics wedge-peel test...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} performance, {{reliability and}} durability of polymer composites {{can now be}} correlated with three generic classes of internal defects. The first generic class of chemical structure defects (size 10 - 100 Å) that control critical design properties such as glass transition Tg, moisture absorption, and dimensional changes can be controlled by chemical analysis of raw materials prior to manufacture. A second generic class of manufacturing defects (size greater than l 0 μm) include inclusions, voids and debonds which are related to manufacturing process control and recognized by ultrasonics, optical scanning and other techniques sensitive to interfacial imperfections. The interaction of these two classes of intrinsic defects with environmental and mechanical stresses produces a third class of macroscopic fatigue defects such as interconnected microcracks and macroscopic crack growth which can be detected by visual inspection and ultrasonic emission. The recognition of intrinsic structural defects, and their contributions to polymer composite reliability, represents an important extension in the analytic modeling and reliability predictions for structural polymers, adhesively bonded metals and high strength fiber reinforced composites in which the physical chemistry parameters appear as primary control variables. This discussion introduces and discusses combined deterministic/statistical models for polymer composite reliability. The molecular process which determines the relation between environmental condition and macroscopic structural effect is detailed within such models and provides important criteria for chemical and manufacturing optimization of polymer composite reliability. Experimental data of aging effects on the statistical strength distributions of structure polymers, <b>metal-to-metal</b> <b>joints</b> and reinforced composites are examined and compared with model· predictions...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{relates to}} the {{numerical}} prediction of the mode I failure of <b>metal-to-metal</b> adhesive <b>joints</b> under quasi-static, steady-state conditions {{by means of a}} criterion based on attaining a critical value of the maximum principal stress at a critical distance ahead of the crack tip. Firstly, the values for the maximum principal stress/critical distance for three different epoxy-based structural adhesives have been identified from the experimental data, and the values of the required maximum principal stress/critical distance have been interpreted, with the help of SEM images, in terms of the physical mechanisms responsible for fracture. Secondly, numerical simulations have been undertaken employing these values of the respective maximum principal stress/critical distance and have revealed that the proposed model predicted very accurately the failure of the three adhesives (i) over a wide range of the thickness of the adhesive layer from 0. 1 to 1 mm, and (ii) for two very different test geometries: namely the tapered double-cantilever beam (TDCB) test and the wedge-peel test. Finally, a non-dimensional theoretical study has been undertaken to ascertain the effect of the bulk properties of the adhesive and of the parameters of the failure criterion on the predicted value of the adhesive fracture energy {{as a function of the}} bondline thickness. The results have revealed that low values of the yield stress and of the hardening exponent as well as large values of the critical maximum principal stress tended to magnify the value of the adhesive fracture energy...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of numerical models capable of predicting reliably, with constant material parameters, the failure of <b>metal-to-metal</b> adhesive <b>joints</b> in a large range of configurations. Two finite element-based models are considered. The first one, referred to as the AACZ model (Adherend + Adhesive + Cohesive Zone), consists of embedding in the adhesive a single row of a cohesive zone elements with zero thickness which are meant to represent and condense the damage mechanisms responsible for fracture. The second one, referred to as the MPS model (Maximum Principal Stress), considers that the conditions for steady-state crack propagation are met when the maximum principal stress reaches a particular value at a critical distance ahead of the crack tip, this particular value being needed to debond, cleave or cavitate the second-phase particles present in the adhesive. The numerical results first show that the MPS model is very promising since it reproduces accurately, over a large range of adhesive layer thicknesses and test conditions, the failure of three commercial structural adhesives exhibiting different levels of resistance to fracture or adhesive fracture energies. The numerical predictions obtained with both models are further exploited {{to gain a better understanding}} of: (i) the physical mechanisms responsible for fracture in these adhesives, (ii) the different energy terms contributing to the adhesive fracture energy, and (iii) the effects of constraint. Hence, it has been possible to determine how the adhesive fracture energy is affected as a function of the geometry of the test specimen and the type of test. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} stress states in two-dimensional models of <b>metal-to-metal</b> adhesively bonded <b>joints</b> subjected to 4 -point flexural loading using finite element (FE) method. The FE simulations were carried out on adhesive bonded joints of high support span to specimen thickness ratio undergoing extensive plastic deformations. Two different adhesive types with eight different adhesive layer thicknesses each varied between 50 μm to 1500 μm were considered. The lower interfaces in the brittle adhesive were observed to be under a lower stress state because of the constraint exerted by a relatively stiff lower adherend. The ductile adhesive layers were under a lower state of stress {{as a result of}} the lower elastic modulus. It is concluded that the degree of plastic deformation in the adhesive is dictated by the adherend stiffness and the load transfer along the interface. The effect of load and support pins is noticeable at all adhesive thicknesses. High stress localisation exists in the vicinity of the load pins. The constraint exerted by the adherends dictates the deformation gradient through thickness of the adhesive layer. Adhesive joint behaviour as determined by the adhesive properties are investigated and also experimentally validated. Conclusions were drawn by correlating the adhesive and adherend stress states...|$|R
