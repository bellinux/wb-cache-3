25|$|The European Parliament heard {{testimony}} about organ harvesting in China during a 6 December 2012 session {{on human rights}} in China. One year later, it passed a resolution expressing “deep concern over the persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs, {{as well as from}} members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.” The resolution called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience, and urged Chinese authorities to respond to United Nations inquiries about the source of organs used in transplants. In March 2014, the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels convened a follow-up event on organ transplant abuses in China. Participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution, which recognized that Falun Gong and other minority groups are targets of forced organ harvesting in China. EESC President <b>Henri</b> <b>Malosse</b> called for greater pressure to be put on the Chinese government to end organ transplant abuses.|$|R

Well, there we were, hunted, like wolves, from one forest to another, till about the middle of winter, we fixed ourselves {{for a while in}} the wood of Vesins, about three leagues to the east of Cholet, a little to the south of the great road from Saumur. From this place <b>M.</b> <b>Henri</b> harassed them most effectually; about fifty of the old Vendeans had joined him, and with these he stopped their provisions, interrupted their posts, and on one occasion, succeeded in getting the despatches from Paris to the republican General. We were at this work for about six weeks; and he, as he always did, exposed himself to every possible danger. One morning we came upon two republican grenadiers; there were <b>M.</b> <b>Henri,</b> two others and myself there, and we wanted immediately to fire upon them; but <b>M.</b> <b>Henri</b> would not have it so; he said that he would save them, and rushed forward to bid them lay down their arms; as he did so, the foremost of them fired, and <b>M.</b> <b>Henri</b> fell dead without a groan." ...|$|R
