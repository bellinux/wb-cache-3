We studied the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on a person and his or her driving capabilities, how often people drive under the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and how often it comes up as a secondary reason for traffic accidents. We also investigated how drivers under the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> are treated, and how occurrences of such driving could be prevented. At the end, we described some projects and organizations that deal with the prevention of this problem. In the empiric part, we used a quantitative approach to check the most common reasons for driving under the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> We were also interested in the differences between men and women, and younger and older drivers regarding their opinions on driving under the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> We were also looking for a connection between experiences of driving under the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and opinions regarding rising or lowering of allowed concentration <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the blood.

Thus was a change in view <b>of</b> the <b>alcohol</b> dependence. Edwards and Gross separated core symptoms <b>of</b> an <b>alcohol</b> dependence and alcohol  related  disabilities. They postulated that alcohol dependence exists in degrees of severity. This is very important for different therapies on the base of severity. The dimensional view <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependence had influence on the international classification systems ICD 10 and DSM  IIIR /DSM  IV. DSM  IIIR and DSM  IV difference dimensional criteria of the severity of dependence from psychotropic substance in consideration of social disorders.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on freshman women during the critical transition into college. Specifically, the study focused on differences in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts and attitudes toward use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among freshman women prior to college. Further, the study focused on changes in use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts, and attitude toward use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among freshman women during their initial term of college. To provide background, demographic characteristics based on level <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use were compiled. The subjects in this study were 132 entering freshman women attending Oregon State University in fall 1979. The data used in testing the hypotheses under investigation were collected during summer 1979 and during the first weeks of winter term 1980. Alcohol use and alcohol use group classification were determined by a Quantity-Frequency instrument. The Student Alcohol Questionnaire measured the subjects' knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts. The attitude instrument measured attitude toward intemperate (excessive) use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The hypotheses developed to test initial differences in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts and attitude toward use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> were tested utilizing the analysis of variance. Where significance was indicated, further analysis was conducted with the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure to determine specific initial differences among alcohol use groups. Paired t-tests were utilized to analyze changes in use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts, and attitudes toward alcohol use for the total sample and individual use groups. The. 05 level of significance was required for all tests. The results of the study indicated: 1. There were no significant differences in knowledge <b>of</b> facts about <b>alcohol</b> among entering freshman women based on their level <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use. 2. There were significant differences in attitude toward the use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among the entering freshman women. a. The abstaining group of freshman women were significantly the least tolerant of intemperate use of alchol by themselves and others. b. The infrequent drinking group of freshman women supported intemperate drinking by themselves and others to a significantly greater extent than the abstaining group. c. The infrequent drinking group of freshman women were significantly less tolerant of intemperate use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> by themselves and others than the light, moderate and heavy drinking freshman women. d. The light, moderate and heavy drinking freshman women's attitudes toward intemperate use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> were not significantly different from each other. e. The light, moderate and heavy drinking groups of freshman women endorsed intemperate drinking by themselves and others to a significantly greater extent than the abstaining and infrequent drinking groups of freshman women. 3. There was a significant increase in the use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among the freshman women at the end of their first term of college. 4. There was a significant increase in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts among the freshman women at the end of their first term of college. a.

40|$|Alcohol {{abuse and}} {{alcoholism}} represent substantial problems that affect {{a large portion}} of individuals throughout the world. Extensive research continues to be conducted in an effort to identify the biological basis of the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in order to develop effective pharmacotherapeutic and behavioral interventions. One theory that has developed within the alcohol field over the past four decades postulates that the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> are due to the action of the metabolites/products <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> within the central nervous system (CNS). The most extreme version of this theory suggests that the biologically active metabolites/products <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> created from the breakdown from alcohol, are the ultimate source of the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The contrary theory proposes that the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> are mediated completely through the interaction of the ethanol molecule with several neurochemical systems within the CNS. While there are scientific findings that offer support for both of these stances, the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> are most likely generated through a complex series of peripheral and central effects <b>of</b> both <b>alcohol</b> and its metabolites. Nonetheless, the development of a greater understanding for how the metabolites/products <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> contribute to the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{is an important factor in}} the development of efficacious pharmacotherapies for alcohol abuse and alcoholism. This chapter is intended to provide a historical perspective of the role of acetaldehyde (the first metabolite <b>of</b> <b>alcohol)</b> in alcohol reinforcement as well as review the basic research literature on the effects of acetaldehyde (and acetaldehyde metabolites/products) within the CNS and how these function with regard to alcohol reward...|$|R

When considering child age and gender, baseline alcohol use, and the individual reports of the riskiness <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use, the interaction between alcohol use riskiness reports prospectively predicted greater odds <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use. The highest percentage <b>of</b> childhood <b>alcohol</b> use at one-year follow-up came from those children with both low self-perceived riskiness <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use and high perceived riskiness <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use for other children.
