The weight of plated metal’s percentage of <b>metallized</b> fiber can be derived form measuring the weight of <b>metallized</b> fiber, and using the density formula and the law of conservation of mass with knowing the density of plated metal and the basic fiber. The characterization and measurement of the metal content of the <b>metallized</b> fiber {{at home and abroad}} is compared, the principle of the determination method by density testing is analyzed, the principle of the determination method by density testing is analyzed, and the specific operation is discussed while the silver content determination of silver-plated fiber is as an example, which provides a simple and convenient means for the determination of metal content of the <b>metallized</b> fiber. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>metallized</b> film capacitors, pulse load depends on the {{properties}} of the dielectric material, the thickness of the metallization and the capacitor's construction, especially the construction of the contact areas between the end spray and <b>metallized</b> electrodes.

50|$|A radar {{reflector}} {{can be made}} from a Luneburg lens by <b>metallizing</b> parts of its surface. Radiation from a distant radar transmitter is focussed onto the underside of the metallization {{on the opposite side of}} the lens; here it is reflected, and focussed back onto the radar station. A difficulty with this scheme is that metallized regions block the entry or exit of radiation on that part of the lens, but the non-metallized regions result in a blind-spot on the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, hot dipping, {{galvanic}} coating, <b>metallizing,</b> and calorizing, but the most effective process is hot dipping. The process of hot dipping starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The hot dipping process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|E
50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} <b>metallizing</b> {{process in}} that it is a thermochemical treatment that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements. Specifically, alonizing is the diffusion of aluminum into the surface of a base metal through high temperature vapors. The types of metals that can be alonized include all types of wrought and cast steels (i.e. plain carbon and low alloy grades, ferritic and austenitic steels, highly alloyed nickel-chromium steels, etc.). This process results in an alloy with the surface properties of aluminum while retaining the base metal’s inherent strength and rigidity. Therefore, alonizing does not change the high-temperature mechanical properties of the base metal, which is the advantage of alonizing over simply creating an aluminum alloy (aluminizing the surface versus aluminum throughout the alloy).|$|E
