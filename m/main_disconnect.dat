After continuing to rise to about 220,000 feet (67 km), the SRBs begin to fall back to earth and once back in the denser atmosphere are slowed by a parachute system to prevent damage on ocean impact. A command is sent from the orbiter to the SRB just before separation to apply battery power to the recovery logic network.

Nutrition Situation and Trends There {{are a number of}} sources of anthropometric data in Pakistan, and the National Nutrition Survey 2011 (NNS 2011) is widely regarded as being among the more authoritative nationally and provincially representative surveys. Besides anthropometric measures for children the NNS 2011 also collected data on adult women’s body mass index (BMI) and blood and urine samples for children and adult women to analyse micronutrient adequacy. Apart from its obvious value as a reliable source of information on the current situation, the NNS 2011 has the advantage of comparability with an earlier round of the same survey in 2001 (NNS 2001) ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created.

40|$|This work, {{starting}} from a structural description of Monte Pisano, defines three <b>main</b> aquifers hydraulically <b>disconnected</b> from the San Giuliano Terme thermal system. The {{characterization of the}} three hydrogeological systems allows to calcolate the respective water budgets based on 1956 - 2002 rainfall and temperatures data. Moreover, in 2006 June-July, a survey and sampling of the main springs, fed by the defined aquifers, was undertaken. All this along with the chemical analysis allows to infer the paths and the travel time of the water through the aquifers. Finally, a comparison between these analysed waters and San Giuliano Terme thermal waters was performed: it led to trace the hydrochemical evolution of Monte Pisano waters on San Giuliano Terme side...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Designing Anti-Islanding Detection Using the Synchrophasor Vector Processor Ruth Huang The {{need for}} {{distributed}} generation (DG) {{has become more}} and more popular because of the adverse effects of fossil fuels and the fear of running out of fossil fuels. By having DG, there are less transmission losses, voltage support, controllability of the system, decreased costs in transmission and distribution, power quality improvement, energy efficiency, and reduced reserve margin. The adverse effects of DG are voltage flicker, harmonics, and islanding. Islanding occurs when the DG continues to energize the power system when the <b>main</b> utility is <b>disconnected.</b> Detecting islanding is important for personnel safety, speedy restoration, and equipment protection. This paper describes the different islanding methods currently used and the benefits of combining two passive islanding detection methods, under/over voltage detection and voltage phase jump detection methods, using the synchrophasor vector processor (SVP) ...|$|R
50|$|The CMU&PR {{saw that}} its only chance of {{becoming}} profitable was securing {{the transport of}} iron ore from the Forest ore, and this would not happen while the two systems, the former Monmouth Railway and the CMU&PR <b>main</b> line were <b>disconnected.</b> It was decided in September 1858 to extend the CMU&PR over the River Wye and down the valley for about two miles to Redbrook, {{and to make a}} transfer point there. Thus a considerable viaduct over the Wye at Monmouth would be undertaken. At a board meeting in December 1858, the decision was taken to provide wrought-iron tramway plates on the Monmouth Railway section, adequate for locomotives. Joseph Firbank was the contractor selected to build the bridge, and in January 1860 the board resolved that they would convert the tramroad to an edge railway, and flatten the worst of the curves for locomotive operation.|$|R

On lap {{one of the}} 1966 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, when sudden rain caused many crashes, he found himself trapped in his overturned BRM, getting soaked by leaking fuel. The marshals had no tools to help him, and it took his teammate Hill and Bob Bondurant, who had also crashed nearby, {{to get him out}} after borrowing a spanner from a spectator's car. Since then, a <b>main</b> switch to <b>disconnect</b> electrics and a removable steering wheel have become standard. Also, noticing the long and slow transport to a hospital, he brought his own doctor to future races, while BRM supplied a medical truck for the benefit of all. Stewart also began keeping a spanner taped to his steering wheel. It was a poor year all around; the BRMs were unreliable, although Stewart did win the Monaco Grand Prix. Stewart had some success in other forms of racing during the year, winning the 1966 Tasman Series and the 1966 Rothmans 12 Hour International Sports Car Race.|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{detailed}} information about flexible D-STATCOM, {{which is used to}} mitigate and reduces all types of faults and operate as a Distributed Generation. When the <b>main</b> source is <b>disconnected</b> it supplies power to sensitive loads and doesn‟t interrupt the supply power to the loads. Thus D-STATCOM operates same as a flexible D-STATCOM and hence is known as Flexible D-STATCOM. The performance of Flexible D-STATCOM system is to mitigate power quality problems and improve distribution system performance under all types of system related disturbances and system unbalanced faults, such as Line-to-Line and DLG faults under islanding condition. 12 -pulse D-STATCOM configuration is utilized with IGBT which is designed and is used in determining the graphical representation of the D-STATCOM using the software PSCAD/EMTDC electromagnetic transient simulation program. The reliability and robustness of the control schemes in the system is determined by the voltage disturbances occurred by Line to line and double line to ground faults and islanded operating condition are thus verified in the results obtained in simulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically {{the shadows of}} a non-Kerr {{rotating}} compact object which belongs to Manko-Novikov family. The non-integrable photon motion caused by quadrupole mass moment affects sharply {{the shadow of the}} compact object. As the quadrupole mass moment parameter is negative, the shadow of compact object is prolate and there are two <b>disconnected</b> <b>main</b> shadows with eyebrows located symmetrically {{on both sides of the}} equatorial plane. As the quadrupole mass moment parameter is positive, the shadow becomes oblate and the main shadow is joined together in the equatorial plane. Moreover, in this positive cases, there is a disorder region in the left of shadow which increases with the quadrupole mass moment parameter. Interestingly, we also find that Einstein ring is broken as the deviation from Kerr metric is larger than a certain critical value. This critical value decreases with the rotation parameter of black hole. Especially, the observer on the direction of rotation axis will find some concentric bright rings in the black disc. Our result show that the presence of quadrupole mass moment brings richer patterns for the shadow of a non-Kerr rotating compact object. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|In a sense, {{social media}} {{has become the}} ideal manifestation of the 2 ̆ 2 Marketplace of Ideas 2 ̆ 2 (hereinafter 2 ̆ 2 Marketplace 2 ̆ 2) that Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes articulated. The Marketplace concept will be {{discussed}} in greater detail below, but in brief, it is the theory that truth will surface over falsehoods when all opinions and ideas are freely expressed, because the value or worth of that opinion or idea will be determined on the market of public opinion. Part I of this Note will examine the Marketplace concept through the works of various legal and philosophical theorists. Chief among them is Frederick Schauer 2 ̆ 7 s work Free Speech: A Philosophical Enquiry, in which he discusses the Marketplace theory and the concept 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on freedom of speech in order to pursue the truth and increase knowledge. Schauer points out two major assumptions that are critical to the Marketplace theory: 1) that reason prevails amongst all members of society and 2) that open debate and discussion are always beneficial because society will eventually be guided towards the truth. Schauer argues that neither of these assumptions are necessarily true, and in the instance of an emergency, the Marketplace theory breaks down entirely. However, Schauer and other Marketplace theorists 2 ̆ 7 analyses do not end our inquiry into the disconnects between the Marketplace model and the utilization of social media during emergencies and public health crises. This Note next explores the use of limited regulatory structures in an adaptive Marketplace in the new environment of digital speech. This Note will examine the argument that freedom of speech in the digital age should have some form of regulatory structure in place, based on principles normally associated with collective self-government, to manage discourse and structure public debate. Additionally, this Note will explore Supreme Court opinions by former Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Brennan, in which the justices articulate the existence of mini-marketplaces, with the possibility of different regulatory schemes depending on each unique marketplace. Having established the background necessary for an understanding of the Marketplace theory, Part II of this Note will next turn to the application of these concepts in the context of social media. Social media 2 ̆ 7 s design openly embraces the Marketplace theory; it enables virtually anyone to contribute his comments, thoughts, and ideas to the conversation. These characteristics are equally applicable to social media 2 ̆ 7 s use as a resource during emergencies and public health crises. However, the intersection of social media and emergency situations is where the pure Marketplace theory begins to break down and the false assumptions of the model that Schauer exposed begin to show. Part III of this Note explores three <b>main</b> <b>disconnects</b> with the Marketplace theory and its application to social media and emergencies: 1) time for vast quantities of information to filter through the system, 2) potential negative effects as a result of false or counterproductive information, and 3) vetting the trustworthiness of sources. [ [...] . ] Lastly, Part IV of this Note will propose self-regulation as a potential solution to the disconnects between the Marketplace and social media 2 ̆ 7 s use during an emergency or crisis. This Note will argue for a system of freedom of expression where self-regulatory structures exist to manage discourse and structure public debate, rather than a dialectical free-for-all in a pure Marketplace model. Relying on the theories of Justices Brennan and Rehnquist, this Note will then argue that social media use during an emergency or crisis creates its own mini-marketplace subject to its own unique regulatory scheme [...] a scheme of self-regulation. Having proposed this potential solution, Part V of this Note will then analyze case studies in which social media was used during an emergency or crisis. These case studies will reveal the use of self-regulation, thus demonstrating the Marketplace 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adapt in order to overcome the disconnects that arise {{in the context of the}} use of social media during emergencies and crises...|$|R
40|$|Grounded {{theory was}} used to examine the social work {{perspective}} on English language learners (ELLs) entering special education. Fourteen interviews were conducted with 11 current school social workers from seven counties and cities in Virginia. The resulting theory is that the core variable, supporting ELLs, is the best attempt to resolve the <b>main</b> concern, the <b>disconnect</b> between the needs of ELLs and the resources available to them. This grounded theory suggests social workers and other school personnel can support ELLs and avoid an inappropriate referral to special education through: (1) culturally and linguistically appropriate assessment outside of the special education process, with particular attention to needs related to trauma and language acquisition; and (2) connection to available culturally and linguistically appropriate resources to meet the identified needs. Key findings are organized into eight dimensions: the school setting; the policy context; the needs of ELLs, engaging families of ELLs; community connections; the professional setting; the special education process; and the profession of social work. Implications include recommendations for policy change, changes to school social work practice, and changes in social work education. Further research includes testing the theory by examining the relationships between assessment, need, resource availability, and disproportional representation, as well as related areas of research such as the differences between high-ELL and low-ELL school divisions...|$|R

One of the <b>main</b> ap-plications are <b>disconnect</b> able mooring systems (SWIVEL connections) for offshore Floating Production Storage and Offloading units (FPSO). Due to the increasing demand for energy ever larger cast or forged parts are required in the offshore industry. It is a well known fact that in larger duplex stainless steel forgings precipitation of detrimental phases can take place, such as Sigma phase or nitrides. Impact strength at low temperature and corrosion resistance will be influenced by these precipitations. Therefo-re mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of ring rolled products with large wall thicknesses are the main objective of this report. Hence, mechanical properties including impact strength were determined {{as a function of}} specimen test location depth in a part that failed during acceptance testing. Additionally two test rings with identical wall thickness and different forging ratios were investigated in the same manner. Corrosion resistance tests were performed according to ASTM G 48 and in some cases Critical Pitting Temperature (CPT) was established. The microstructure was examined via Optical Microscopy as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A Focused Ion Beam (FIB) device was used to micromachine TEM foils at evident sites in SEM specimens.

40|$|The {{descriptive}} information, analyses, and referenced documents, including {{electrical single}} line diagrams, electrical schematics, logic diagrams, tables, and physical arrangement drawings for the offsite power systems, {{presented in the}} applicant's safety analysis report (SAR), are reviewed. The objective of the review is to determine that this system satisfies the requirements of GDC 5, 17, and 18, and will perform its design functions during all plant operating and accident conditions. The offsite power system is referred to in industry standards and regulatory guides as the "preferred power system. " It includes two or more physically independent circuits capable of operating independently of the onsite standby power sources and encompasses the grid, transmission lines (overhead or underground), transmission line towers, transformers, switchyard components and control systems, switchyard battery systems, the <b>main</b> generator, and <b>disconnect</b> switches, provided to supply electric power to safety-related and other equipment.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} dynamic {{behaviour}} and transients of a sub-system when operating in two scenarios: Grid-connected mode, and islanding mode. The sub-system {{consists of two}} distributed generators (DGs). One DG is modeled using a rotating synchronous machine fitted with a governor to represent a diesel generator, while the other is modeled using a DC voltage source and a converter to represent a photovoltaic (PV) energy source. The distribution network also consists of a grid connected source known as the main grid. During normal operation, the supply of electricity to the connected loads is shared among the three energy sources, the DGs supplying about 80 percent of the loads and the rest are supplied by the main grid. When the <b>main</b> grid is <b>disconnected</b> from the network, supply to the connected loads is shared by the two DGs. The PV energy source system is equipped with real and reactive power control mechanisms that minimize islanding transients and maintain angle stability and voltage quality of the network. The study includes examples of micro-grid transient analysis {{carried out in the}} past. This is followed by the study of how transient analysis can be carried out in PowerFactory software. The simulation studies show that the electronic power control system in a PV generator is capable of maintaining the angle stability of a micro grid in response to transient conditions. These transients may result from changes in power demands from connected loads or severe islanding events. The diesel generator {{through the use of a}} governor responds to supply the required power to the system when the PV has reached its maximum supply limits. The diesel generator acts as a back-up to the PV supply...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{field measurements}} and numerical modeling that {{provide insight into}} the nearshore geochemical conditions and groundwater flows controlling the mobility of arsenic (As) in a freshwater beach aquifer and its potential discharge to Lake Erie. Field measurements were performed via shore-normal monitoring transects installed at beaches (Little Beach and Main Beach) located adjacent to a brownfield industrial harbour site that has elevated sediment and groundwater As concentrations. Detailed pore water chemistry analyses revealed elevated As (up to 0. 056 mg/L) 1 - 2 m below the shoreline at all transect locations. The distributions of species in the aqueous and sedimentary phases suggest that As mobility is strongly linked with iron (Fe) redox cycling. Sediment analysis by sequential extraction revealed a layer of amorphous and crystalline Fe (hydr) oxides present at the sediment-water interface (SWI) near the shoreline. This Fe hydr(oxide) layer may be accumulating As and preventing its release to nearshore waters. Numerical modeling combined with vertical hydraulic gradient measurements indicated that wave-induced recirculation across the aquifer-lake interface was significant and this likely establishes the redox gradient that led to Fe (hydr) oxides precipitation at the SWI. Numerical and field results showed that the water infiltration/exfiltration across the groundwater-lake interface were sensitive to varying wave intensity and seasonal lake water level fluctuations. The source of As in the nearshore beach aquifers remains unknown. While Little Beach is adjacent to the East Headland of the industrial site where elevated As has been recorded, <b>Main</b> Beach is <b>disconnected</b> hydraulically from the East Headland. If the elevated dissolved As observed is from a natural geogenic source, this findings of this thesis may have widespread implications for As cycling in the nearshore areas of the Great Lakes. Finally, while this study focused on As, the nearshore geochemistry and subsurface flows investigated are be pertinent to understanding the discharge of other chemicals (e. g., nitrate, ammonium, phosphorous) to nearshore inland coastal waters via the groundwater pathway...|$|R
40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) based vehicle {{tracking}} over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) had been {{widely used in}} many places. This system {{was a combination of}} GPS in a vehicle to indicate its position on the geographic coordinate and a GPRS to send the data of position and other important data into a computer connected via the Internet. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a data service part of a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM cellular phone with speed from 56 kilobit per second (kbps) up to 114 kbps. Coordinate data obtained from the GPS receiver onboard the vehicle was processed fully inside the receiver unit and the output of the unit was serial data communication using TTL logic level using NMEA 0183 protocol which was connected to the first serial port of a microcontroller. Before the coordinate system of the GPS passed to the GPRS unit, the microcontroller also checked the other conditions such as emergency button, power supply, internal battery and speed of vehicle. The unit had internal Lithium battery to selfsufficient its power consumption up to 10 hours. The battery could be recharged automatically from the vehicle battery with its own power management module. The lithium battery was important when the vehicle was stolen and the <b>main</b> battery was <b>disconnected</b> from the vehicle, the system could still track the vehicle. This unit was also equipped with vehicle security alert system in which when there were security breaches, the driver of the vehicle could push a hidden button and the operator would notice it almost immediately via the web page.

40|$|Persistent social {{problems}} such as homelessness, indigenous disadvantage, and poverty are recognised to be complex, messy, interconnected issues requiring multifaceted solutions. In response to these problems, there has been increasing cross-sector action involving business, investors, government agencies, NGOs, and social enterprises to uncover and implement novel solutions. This action has been matched by the growing prioritisation and sophistication of attempts to understand, measure, and report {{the impact of these}} activities. Social impact investment is proposed as an interesting context in which to explore the intersection of cross-sector action and impact assessment, given its focus on realising measurable social impact along with the presence of cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. Theory has not sufficiently addressed the complex nature of impact assessment, nor how it is enacted in everyday organisational activities or across organisational boundaries. Additionally, whilst there is a sound understanding of inter-organisational relationships within sectors, there has been limited theoretical development on cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. This thesis explores how the everyday practice of impact assessment shapes, and is shaped by, cross-sector inter-organisational relationships focused on creating social impact. It examines the challenges inherent in assessing impact and the potential and actual tensions posed by these inter-organisational relationships. Impact assessment is characterised as a social practice enacted across inter-organisational relationships. Foundations to underpin this research are drawn from practice theory and existential phenomenology. The thesis adopts the philosophical perspective of the life-world to ensure impact assessment practice can be better understood in the context of cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. The life-world perspective takes everyday experience as the starting point for theorising. This informs the choice of Heideggerian interpretive phenomenology as the research methodology. Interpretive phenomenology focuses on the meaningful way in which things are experienced in the everyday activities of organisations and individuals. A multiple case study design studies the emerging social impact investment ecosystems in Australia and the United Kingdom. More than 90 qualitative interviews with practitioners across the two ecosystems shed light on impact assessment practice and cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. There are three <b>main</b> findings: (i) <b>disconnects</b> between the everyday sayings and doings of impact assessment manifest as an empty rhetoric; (ii) multilingual brokers are the key actors in facilitating cross-sector inter-organisational relationships and the translation of impact assessment practice across organisational boundaries; and (iii) impact assessment should be understood as a transdisciplinary practice emerging and evolving from multiple practice worlds such as strategy, accounting, and organisational learning. This research offers multiple contributions for practitioners and academia through advancing understandings of impact assessment and cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. For practitioners, this research emphasises the multiple potential benefits and applications of impact assessment, and highlights the central role for multilingual practitioners in facilitating cross-sector inter-organisational relationships. For academia, understanding how new practice worlds evolve from established practice offers a more dynamic perspective on practice theory.
