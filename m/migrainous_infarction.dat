5000|$|Following {{appropriate}} {{management of}} acute migraine, {{patients should be}} evaluated for initiation of preventive therapy. Factors that should prompt consideration of preventive therapy include the occurrence {{of two or more}} migraines per month with disability lasting three or more days per month; failure of, contraindication for, or adverse events from acute treatments; use of abortive medication more than twice per week; and uncommon migraine conditions (e.g., hemiplegic migraine, migraine with prolonged aura, <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction).</b> Patient preference and cost also should be considered....Therapy should be initiated with medications that have the highest levels of effectiveness and the lowest potential for adverse reactions; these should be started at low dosages and titrated slowly. A full therapeutic trial may take two to six months. After successful therapy (e.g., reduction of migraine frequency by approximately 50 percent or more) has been maintained for six to 12 months, discontinuation of preventive therapy can be considered.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous (31) P-magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy ((31) P-MRS) {{studies have}} shown that cerebral cortical energy metabolism is abnormal in migraine and that cortical energy reserves decrease with increasing severity and duration of aura. <b>Migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> is a rare complication of migraine with aura, and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We used (31) P-MRS to determine whether migrainous stroke shows similar interictal abnormalities in cortical energy metabolism as severe, prolonged aura. METHODS: We used (31) P-MRS to study patients with a diagnosis of either <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> or migraine with persistent aura without infarction (aura duration > 7 days) according to International Headache Society criteria. We compared clinical presentation and metabolite ratios between patient groups. We also studied healthy controls with no history of migraine. RESULTS: Patients with persistent aura without infarction had lower phosphocreatine-phosphate (PCr/Pi) ratios (mean+/-SD, 1. 61 +/- 0. 10) compared with controls (1. 94 +/- 0. 35, P= 0. 011) and with patients with migrainous stroke (1. 96 +/- 0. 16, P< 0. 0001). These differences were present in cortical tissue only. In migrainous stroke patients, the metabolite ratios did not differ significantly from those of controls without migraine. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in cortical energy reserves between patients with migrainous stroke and in those with migraine with persistent aura suggest that the pathomechanisms of these conditions differ and that <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> does not simply represent a particularly severe form of migrainous aura. This finding supports the revised International Headache Society criteria, which now distinguish between <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> and migraine with persistent aura without infarction...|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of known causative factors of cerebral infarction was studied in 244 cases of first ever stroke due to cerebral infarction proved by computed tomography or at necropsy who were {{registered in the}} first two years of a prospective community based study. Risk factors for cerebral infarction were present in 196 (80 %) cases; hypertension in 126 (52 %); ischaemic heart disease in 92 (38 %); peripheral vascular disease in 60 (25 %); a cardiac lesion that was a major potential source of embolism to the brain in 50 (20 %); transient ischaemic attacks in 35 (14 %); cervical arterial bruit in 33 (14 %); and diabetes mellitus in 24 (10 %). Thirty one patients (13 %) were in atrial fibrillation. Of the 48 patients who were free of risk factors or a major potential cardiac source of embolism at the time of the stroke, 18 were found to have hypertension after the stroke and 10 to have non-atheromatous non-embolic conditions (<b>migrainous</b> cerebral <b>infarction</b> (three), arteritis (two), inflammatory bowel disease (one), arterial trauma (one), autoimmune disease (one), carcinoma of the thyroid (one), and major operation (one). In 20 patients no causative factors could be identified. In this unselected series of patients with first ever stroke due to cerebral infarction most of the strokes were presumed to be due to either atheromatous arterial disease or embolism from the heart, and only 4 % (95 % confidence interval 2 to 7 %) were probably due to non-atheromatous non-embolic causes. This has implications for research into strokes and allocation of public health expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Although {{migraine}} is {{an accepted}} cause of cerebral infarction in adults, this association is less well recognized in children. We present two children with migraine and cerebral infarction, which we regard as migrainous stroke, though neither patient fulfills all criteria of the International Headache Society for {{the diagnosis of}} <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction.</b> Review of the literature concerning examples of migraine-associated stroke in childhood suggests that these criteria are too restrictive to comprise the majority of migrainous strokes, especially in this age group. (J Child Neurol 1999; 14 : 451 - 455). The average annual incidence of stroke in children is about 2. 5 per 100, 000; strokes associated with birth, intracranial infection, or trauma are not included. 1 The causes of cerebral infarction in childhood have been reviewed elsewhere. 21 Heart disease, vascular dis-eases, hematologic disorders, primary hypercoagulable states, or inborn metabolic disorders, especially mito-chondrial diseases, should be considered; but 50 % of strokes are regarded as idiopathic. 5...|$|E
40|$|Migraine with aura (MA) is {{associated}} with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in young women with vascular risk factors (smoke, contraceptive pill). Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has also been associated with MA. We describe a 41 -year-old man, in good health, with MA since 16, familiar history of diabetes, heavy smoker (30 cigarettes/day). Frequency (1 - 2 attacks/year) and clinical features of migraine have been unchanged since the onset. A few days before our examination he suffered a typical migraine attack. In the following hours, however, the headache became more and more throbbing and the aura symptoms (regressed as usual in 30 min) reappeared and persisted, so he went to an Emergency Department. The CT-scan (without contrast) was normal. The following days he had visual disturbances and spatial disorientation. We found a normal neurological examination and fundus oculi. He referred persisting visual troubles. We prescribed MR + angioMR which confirmed a <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> and ruled out others pathological conditions. Further tests found out dislipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, impaired glucose tolerance. Transcranial Doppler showed right to left shunting. We also prescribed the screening tests for vasculitis (normal). In our opinion this case highlights the relevance of vascular risk factors in MA complications also in male subjects.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of primary headache disorders is clinical {{and based on}} the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society (ICHD- 3 -beta). However several brain conditions may mimic primary headache disorders and laboratory investigation may be needed. This necessity occurs when the treating physician doubts for the primary origin of headache. Features that represent a warning for a possible underlying disorder causing the headache are new onset headache, change in previously stable headache pattern, headache that abruptly reaches the peak level, headache that changes with posture, headache awakening the patient, or precipitated by physical activity or Valsalva manoeuvre, first onset of headache ≥ 50 years of age, neurological symptoms or signs, trauma, fever, seizures, history of malignancy, history of HIV or active infections, and prior history of stroke or intracranial bleeding. All national headache societies and the European Headache Alliance invited to review and comment the consensus before the final draft. The consensus recommends brain MRI for the case of migraine with aura that persists on one side or in brainstem aura. Persistent aura without infarction and <b>migrainous</b> <b>infarction</b> require brain MRI, MRA and MRV. Brain MRI with detailed study of the pituitary area and cavernous sinus, is recommended for all TACs. For primary cough headache, exercise headache, headache associated with sexual activity, thunderclap headache and hypnic headache apart from brain MRI additional tests may be required. Because there is little and no good evidence the committee constructed a consensus based on the opinion of experts, and should be treated as imperfect...|$|E
