25|$|<b>MOSFET</b> analog {{switches}} use the <b>MOSFET</b> to pass {{analog signals}} when on, {{and as a}} high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a <b>MOSFET</b> switch. In this application, the drain and source of a <b>MOSFET</b> exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate–source, gate–drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} 4 H-SiC p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (<b>MOSFETs)</b> with deposited SiO 2 followed by N 2 O annealing. In addition to deposited oxides, dry-O 2 -grown oxides and N 2 O-grown oxides were also adopted as the gate oxides of SiC p-channel <b>MOSFETs.</b> The <b>MOSFETs</b> have been fabricated on the 4 H-SiC (0001), (0001 macr), (033 macr 8), and (112 macr 0) faces.

25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance <b>MOSFET</b> technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a <b>MOSFET</b> in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single <b>MOSFET</b> output to drive a considerable number of <b>MOSFET</b> inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high <b>MOSFET</b> output impedance, {{which is to}} say, the <b>MOSFET</b> current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, {{the influence of the}} drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the <b>MOSFET</b> current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance, circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure.|$|E

25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} <b>MOSFET</b> surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the <b>MOSFET</b> surrounds the gate. Another RHBD <b>MOSFET</b> is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard <b>MOSFET.</b> In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard <b>MOSFET</b> due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard <b>MOSFET.</b> Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard <b>MOSFET.</b> Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E
