Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Atto was {{captured}} by Task Force Ranger on September 21, 1993, from a location near Digfer Hospital. The Rangers had made an earlier attempt at Atto's capture, but missed him by seconds. In a speech at a church in Daytona, in January 2002, William Boykin, responsible for the operation, recounted, [...] "There {{was a man in}} Mogadishu named Osman Atto... He went on CNN and he laughed at us, and he said, 'They'll never get me because Allah will protect me.'" [...] The arrest was later portrayed in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In an interview with the BBC, Atto indicated that many aspects of the movie are factually incorrect. He took exception with the ostentatious character chosen to portray him; Atto does not look like the actor who portrayed him, smoke cigars, or wear earrings, facts which were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, Atto in reality seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he was not consulted about the project or approached for permission, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies: [...] "First of all when I was caught on 21 September, I was only travelling with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it shows in the film... And when the helicopter attacked, people were hurt, people were killed... The car we were travelling in, and I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times. And <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both the individual and the action. It was not right.|$|E
