Its draft genome sequence revealed that strain Chr- 9 harbors sets of genes for resistance to heavy metals such as lead, <b>mercury,</b> <b>arsenate,</b> and cobalt, as well as three different gene clusters for metabolizing aromatic compounds, such as phenol, benzoate, and 4 -nitrophenol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Previous studies {{demonstrated}} {{differential mortality}} among mosquitofish of different Gpi- 2 genotypes during acute <b>mercury</b> and <b>arsenate</b> exposures. Mercury-exposed mosquitofish also had Gpi- 2 genotype-specific differences in glycolytic and Krebs cycle metabolite pools. The mortality and metabolite data suggested that mosquitofish bearing specific Gpi- 2 genotypes might differ in metabolic efficiency, with less efficient Gpi- 2 genotypes having higher standard metabolic rates (SMRs) and shorter times to death during acute mercury exposure. Effect of Gpi- 2 genotype on SMR was assessed with a factorial arrangement of six Gpi- 2 genotypes and two exposure sequences (Control 2 Control; Control 2 100 mg/L Hg). The SMRs were estimated by measuring oxygen consumption using an indirect, closed-circuit, computer-controlled respirometer. A 48 -h exposure to 100 mg/L of mercury {{resulted in a}} 16. 7 % elevation of SMR above control levels (p 5 0. 001). The Gpi- 2 genotype {{and the number of}} heterozygous loci per individual had no significant effect on SMR in mercury-exposed mosquitofish. The experimental results do not support the hypothesis that Gpi- 2 genotype-specific differences in glycolytic and Krebs cycle metabolite pools and mortality in mosquitofish exposed to mercury are associated with differences in SMR.

40|$|Abstract—Previously we {{reported}} {{that the possibility of}} sensing of chemical substances using gene expression patterns analyzed by DNA microarray using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a sensor (Matsuno et al., 2002, 2006). In this study, we evaluated sensitivity and selectivity of above system using a customized DNA microarray for heavy metal responded genes. The results showed that this system showed high sensitivity and selectivity for heavy metals (cadmium chloride, <b>mercury</b> chloride and <b>arsenate).</b> The threshold value for heavy metals is shown to be less than 1 nM. The accumulation of gene expression patterns and responded gene information by this assay system enable us to provide not only the quantities and/or qualities of known chemicals but also those of unknown chemicals in environment samples. It is possible that this system can evaluate total biological and physiological effect level in pollution, since gene expressions reflect composite effects of sources in pollution...|$|R
40|$|The genes {{encoding}} for beta-lactamase (bla+) {{and resistance}} to metallic ions (cadmium, <b>mercury,</b> lead, <b>arsenate,</b> and arsenite) were located in a 56. 2 -kilobase plasmid, pZA 10, isolated from a clinical strain, Staphylococcus aureus 6344. This strain produced enterotoxin B and enterotoxin C 1. Elimination of pZA 10 by either sodium dodecyl sulfate or heat treatment (43 degrees C) resulted {{in the loss of}} the capability of the bacteria to produce both enterotoxin B and enterotoxin C 1. A physical map of pZA 10 was constructed with BamHI, SalI and BglII restriction endonucleases. Penicillin-resistant, enterotoxin B- and C 1 -producing cotransformants were isolated by transformation with pZA 10 DNA with either S. aureus RN 450 or cured S. aureus 6344 as recipients. The transferred plasmids exhibited genetic instability shown by changes in restriction pattern and molecular size, loss of plasmid DNA, and addition of chromosomal DNA. Enterotoxin B production was related to a 18. 1 -kilobase pZA 10 fragment carried by such a rearranged plasmid. Chromosomal cointegration of bla+ with genetic determinants for metallic ion resistance and enterotoxin B and C 1 production were detected in heat-treated S. aureus 6344. Transformation employing chromosomal DNA containing the integrated plasmid resulted in excision and reestablishment of pZA 10 -related plasmids in the transformants. pZA 10 -linked resistance to cadmium, which was lost upon the integration of pZA 10 into the host chromosome, reappeared in transformants carrying the excised plasmid...|$|R
30|$|The {{level of}} heavy metal {{tolerance}} {{is very high}} in P. putida W 619 in comparison to other P. putida strains (Canovas et al. [2003]; Taghavi et al. [2009]). In P. putida W 619, copper, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, <b>arsenate,</b> <b>mercury,</b> nickel chromate, and molybdenum resistance genes are present in two genomic regions (1 and 31). Heavy metal tolerance of P. putida LS 46 has not been investigated, but this strain encodes genes for heavy metal resistance present in genomic region 1 of P. putida W 619. These genes are involved in copper, cobalt, zinc, and cadmium resistance. However, the genes located on genomic region 31 of P. putida W 619, involved in copper and chromate resistance, were absent {{in the majority of}} P. putida strains, including P. putida LS 46 (Additional file 1 : Table S 8). All P. putida strains lacked the genes present in genomic region 18 of P. putida W 619, which were associated with mercury and nickel resistance.|$|R
40|$|Alkyl {{hydroperoxide}} reductase 1 (Ahp 1 p) is a thioredoxin peroxidase of the peroxiredoxin family {{expressed by}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, {{disruption of the}} AHP 1 gene {{has shown that the}} gene is not essential for yeast growth on glucose medium but revealed a high sensitivity of null mutants to organic peroxides, suggesting that Ahp 1 p is an important enzyme implicated in oxidative stress protection in S. cerevisiae. To gain insight into antioxidant enzymatic mechanisms involved in cell protection against metal toxicity and glutathione depletion, we investigated the resistance of S. cerevisiae, in which the AHP 1 gene was disrupted, against several metals and diethyl maleate, a glutathione depleting agent. We report that Ahp 1 p protects yeast against toxicity induced by copper, cobalt, chromium, arsenite, <b>arsenate,</b> <b>mercury,</b> zinc and diethyl maleate, suggesting that Ahp 1 p {{plays an important role in}} S. cerevisiae in the protection against metals possibly by reducing peroxides generated in cells by these compounds...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{resistance}} to heavy metals and antibiotics, biochemical characteristics, and colicinogeny in selected strains of Escherichia coli of O serogroups 8, 9, 20, 64, 101, and X 46. Of 42 strains that were investigated, 26 were porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 8 were porcine non-enterotoxigenic E. coli (NETEC), and 8 were bovine ETEC. Multiple resistance to antimicrobial agents was common among the strains, and resistance to chloramphenicol and kanamycin was less common than resistance to other drugs, possibly reflecting the lower frequency of use of these agents in pigs and calves. Colicin production was a more common property of porcine ETEC (80. 8 %) than of porcine NETEC (25 %), and all porcine ETEC of O serogroups 101 and 64 were colicinogenic. Equal numbers of bovine ETEC strains were colicinogenic as were non-colicinogenic. Resistance of bovine and porcine strains to sodium <b>arsenate,</b> <b>mercury,</b> and tellerium was 90, 16, and 5 %, respectively. There was a close relationship between serogroup and biochemical reactions among the E. coli strains tested...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and objective: Nowadays the {{microbial}} {{resistance to antibiotics}} and other physicochemical agents has caused various problems {{in the process of}} disinfecting devices and surfaces of the hospitals and in treatment of the patients. Thus, the aim of this study has been to examine resistance patterns of some penicillin resistant bacteria to physiochemical agents (UV and gamma radiation, cetrimide, and some of heavy metals). Materials and methods: In the present study, strains of penicillin resistant bacteria isolated from Alzahra hospital of Esfahan, including 39 strains of Escherichia coli and 23 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. To screen for cetrimide and cadmium, <b>mercury</b> and <b>arsenate</b> resistance was measured using micro titer plates, steer‘s replicator and serial dilution for determining minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: The most MIC determined in E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains respectively were 50 and 400 g/ml (Cd and Hg). MIC of metals was determined in adaptation condition for some of resistant bacteria. Results showed that in the most cases bacteria were selected and radiated with intensity of 0. 25 J/m 2 s. Mean of cfu/ 0. 1 ml after 240 s radiation in E. coli and P. aeruginosa were, respectively 4. 7 and 3. 6. Gamma radiation was performed with intensity of 20 Gray /min (GY/min) in different times in these resistance bacteria. Mean of cfu/ml for E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains in 1000 Gray dose were, respectively 2. 4 × 102 and 8. 2 × 102. Conclusion: Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains showed higher resistance than E. coli. But {{there was no significant difference}} in MIC of arsenate between these bacteria. Significance and impact of the study: The impact of this study is to find E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains that are multi resistant to physicochemical agents; and to suggest a solution for destroying these specific strains...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the physicochemical properties, mineral and heavy metal content of drinking water sources in two communities in South-East, Nigeria and discuss its public health implication. The water samples were collected from two wells and two streams respectively in the two communities (Ishiagu and Ugwuaji). The physicochemical parameters, minerals and heavy metal content were analyzed using standard methods. The total acidity, total suspended solid (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, phosphorous, <b>arsenate,</b> <b>mercury,</b> lead, and cadmium were above both Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) standards for drinking water while iron was only above EPA standards. Ishiagu stream had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher level of most of the physicochemical parameters, minerals and heavy metals followed by Ugwuaji well then, Ishiagu well and Ugwuaji stream had the lowest. The result shows an indication of minerals and heavy metals contamination of the water sources of both communities. Therefore, it is suggested that these water sources are not good for drinking due to the possible health hazards that may arise from the consumption heavy metal and mineral contaminated water...|$|R
