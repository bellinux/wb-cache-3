40|$|Modeling {{helps to}} {{understand}} and predict the outcome of complex systems. Inductive modeling methodologies are beneficial for modeling the systems where the uncertainties involved in the system do not permit to obtain an accurate physical model. However inductive models, like artificial neural networks (ANNs), may suffer from a few drawbacks involving over-fitting and the difficulty to easily understand the model itself. This can result in user reluctance to accept the model or even complete rejection of the modeling results. Thus, it becomes highly desirable to make such inductive models more comprehensible and to automatically determine the model complexity to avoid over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel type of ANN, a <b>mixed</b> <b>transfer</b> function artificial neural network (MTFANN), which aims to improve the complexity fitting and comprehensibility {{of the most popular}} type of ANN (MLP - a Multilayer Perceptron). <br /...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} shaping the open loop {{structural}} transfer function from a distributed sensor to a distributed actuator is developed. The outputs of two sensors of different impedances are combined electronically {{with the goal}} of increasing pole-zero spacing for improved per-formance in low-authority structural control loops. The concept of a three-element actua-tor-sensor module capable of adjusting the equivalent actuator and sensor impedances is presented. The module consists of an actuator, and two sensors for measuring force and strain. The output of the module is constructed by mixing the force and strain signals using a mixing coefficient which can be used to tune the apparent sensor impedance for maxi-mum performance. General shape of zero trajectories {{as a function of the}} mixing coeffi-cient is derived. Mass-spring and beam models are used to further explore the behavior of the zeroes of the <b>mixed</b> <b>transfer</b> function.

40|$|One {{of the big}} {{problems}} with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is that their results are not intuitively clear. For example, if we use the traditional neurons, with a sigmoid activation function, we can approximate any function, including linear functions, but the coefficients (weights) in this approximation will be rather meaningless. To resolve this problem, this paper presents a novel kind of ANN with different transfer functions mixed together. The aim of such a network is to i) obtain a better generalization than current networks ii) to obtain knowledge from the networks without a sophisticated knowledge extraction algorithm iii) to increase the understanding and acceptance of ANNs.

Effects on PFC responses to thymus-dependent (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have been compared. The unresponsive state {{which developed in}} GVH mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients. Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a <b>mixed</b> <b>transfer</b> system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days. This active suppressor effect {{was found to be}} mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable. The likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed...|$|E

The {{early history of}} chimaeroids, or holocephalans, and the modalities of their divergence from elasmobranchs are much debated. During Carboniferous times, 358 – 300 million years (Myr) ago, they underwent a remarkable evolutionary radiation, with some odd and poorly understood forms, including the enigmatic iniopterygians that were known until now from poorly informative flattened impressions. Here, we report iniopterygian skulls found preserved in 3 dimensions in ≈ 300 -Myr-old concretions from Oklahoma and Kansas. The study was performed by using conventional X-ray microtomography (μCT), as well as absorption-based synchrotron microtomography (SR-μCT) [Tafforeau P, et al. (2006) Applications of X-ray synchrotron microtomography for non-destructive 3 D studies of paleontological specimens.

Mobile species dynamics accompanying film redox switching due to thermodynamic and electroneutrality constraints were theoretically modeled and experimentally determined. In a novel approach, 3 D visual models of solvent and ion transfers under mixed control of thermodynamic and kinetic conditions were described. For the identification of change in behaviour at partial conversion during film redox transformations, flux ratio representations were introduced. Applications of the theoretical models to polyaniline data in EQCM experiments revealed that film solvent population was in equilibrium on the experimental timescale but showed thermodynamic non-ideality. Mass and charge responses of polyaniline gravimetric data were described by a mechanism in which electroneutrality maintenance was satisfied by a <b>mixed</b> <b>transfer</b> of proton and anion. Adsorption/desorption mechanisms of dendrimer on flavin-functionalised surfaces were gravimetrically determined. The energetics and isotherm models of the adsorption/desorption process were investigated. Frumkin model was found to best fit to the experimental data and site-site interaction parameter was extracted. Viscoelastic investigations of polyaniline in electrochemical systems were studied. The effects of different anions on film rheological properties during deposition and redox cycling were explored. Shear moduli data were extracted as functions of potential, temperature and timescale using TSM resonator. In an unprecedented manner, macroscopic viscoelastic properties of polyaniline films were described at a molecular level using WLF, Rouse-Zimm, and Activation models. The “time-temperature superposition” principle was applied and the master relaxation curve was constructed. In correlation between solvent content and film structural dynamics, the energetics of solvation were calculated.

This duality allows us to show that our homology transfer coincides with the one given by L. Smith.

40|$|This work {{sought to}} {{determine}} the factors influencing <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> in the small intestine. Specifically, the work was focussed on the gut periphery (i. e. perivillous region) of the terminal ileum in the brushtail possum (Trichusurus vulpecula). The salient questions to answer were; 1. What are the microrheological properties and disposition of mucus in the perivillous space? 2. What are the disposition and movements of the mucosa and the associated villi during postprandial gut motility patterns of pendular contractions? 3. Are villi rigid structures during physiological levels of lumen flow? The following three main experimental works of this thesis were all conducted using live gut wall samples maintained ex vivo. In addition, computational models were developed incorporating the novel findings detailed in this thesis to assist in visualizing <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> in the perivillous space. 1. The properties of the perivillous fluid environment were assessed by multiple-particle-tracking of the Brownian motion of fluorescent microbeads on gut samples. 2. The movements and disposition of the mucosal surface and associated villi during pendular contractions were observed for whole lengths of everted gut samples. 3. Flow velocities in the perivillous space of gut samples were determined by microparticle-image-velocimetery of microbeads. The movement of villi in response to physiological levels of lumen flow were quantified by image analysis. The following are the main findings and implications of the work. 1. The perivillous fluid environment consisted of discrete viscoelastic bodies dispersed within a watery Newtonian phase. Such characteristics of the fluid environment {{were thought to be}} conducive for <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer,</b> and likened to the processes of gel filtration. 2. Gut pendular contractions generated transient mucosal microfolds, which resulted in the formation of periodic congregation and separation of villous tips. Such a mechanism was predicted (using computational simulations) to augment <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> of nutrients at the gut periphery. 3. Villi were rigid structures, which were more prone to pivot than to bend, while intervillous fluid was predicted to be quasi-static during physiological levels of lumen flow. Such a feature of villi supports a perivillous <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> mechanism driven by mucosal microfolding In conclusion, <b>mixing</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> in the perivillous space are governed by more complex dynamics than previously assumed and by factors previously unknown...|$|R
