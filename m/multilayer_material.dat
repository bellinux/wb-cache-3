40|$|Determining {{the density}} and {{composition}} of <b>multilayer</b> <b>material</b> of variable composition is an important task for many industries. For example, in medicine in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the analysed object is a bone surrounded by fat tissue. In customs control bulk cargo of mixed composition also represents multilayer materials of variable composition. To solve such problems, the methods based on the transmission of X-rays through material (X-ray transmission) are currently used. These methods include X-ray tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorption. However, these methods can give either a qualitative picture of the composition and density of <b>multilayer</b> <b>material</b> {{in the case of}} tomography or a quantitative one with a large error due to averaging the results of measurements across all layers, {{as in the case of}} dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry...|$|E

40|$|Outstanding {{mechanical}} properties of biological <b>multilayered</b> <b>materials</b> are {{strongly influenced by}} nanoscale features in their structure. In this study, mechanical behavior and toughening mechanisms of abalone nacre-inspired <b>multilayered</b> <b>materials</b> are explored. In nacre’s structure, the organic matrix, pillars and the roughness of the -aragonite platelets play important roles in its overall mechanical performance. A micromechanics model for <b>multilayered</b> biological <b>materials</b> is proposed to simulate their mechanical deformation and toughening mechanisms. The fundamental hypothesis of the model is that nanoscale pillars and asperities have near theoretical strength. It has been shown earlier that organic matrix behaves stiffer in proximity of mineral platelets. However, the suggested values for stiffness and strength of organic matrix appear to be high. The proposed model assumes that pillars and the asperities confine the organic matrix to {{the proximity of the}} platelets and hence increase their stiffness and strength. The modeling results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results for abalone nacre. The results show that the stiffness of the organic matrix affects the stiffness of material, whereas platelets’ aspect ratio determines the ultimate strength. The pillars and the asperities are responsible for the ductility of <b>multilayered</b> <b>material.</b> In the proposed model, although all the components of the bioinspired structure have brittle behavior, the overall structure has a ductile response. The highly nonlinear behavior of the suggested <b>multilayered</b> <b>material</b> is a result of a distributed deformation in the nacre-like structure due to existence of nanoasperities and nanopillars with near theoretical strength...|$|R

40|$|A well-verified and {{validated}} {{numerical model}} {{was used to}} investigate stress wave propagation in a <b>multilayer</b> <b>material</b> subjected to impact loading. The baseline material consisted of a ceramic faceplate and composite backing plate separated by a rubber or teflon foam interlayer: several variants were investigated in which the number, type, and total thicknesses of the interlayers were altered. Comparison of the variants showed {{that the use of}} multiple teflon foam interlayers could drastically reduce the average stress in the <b>multilayer</b> <b>material.</b> Based on the numerical results, further experimental work was undertaken upon one of the variants. Very large and unexpected tensile stress oscillations were observed in the ceramic layers, leading to a refinement of the numerical model which successfully reproduced the oscillations and also demonstrated that separation of the sample layers led to trapping of the stress wave within the layers. Use of the validated numerical model allowed detailed analysis of the processes of wave transmission and demonstrates the important synergy that can exist between experimental and modeling studies.

The main objective of this thesis is to further develop a general methodology and utilise it for the examination of fracture problems in <b>multilayered</b> <b>materials.</b> The general methodology {{is based upon the}} distributed dislocation technique and edge dislocation solutions obtained within the framework of plane theory of linear elasticity. This methodology has been shaped by the seminal contributions of many researchers over the past fifty years and currently represents a powerful tool for the analysis of crack problems. New theoretical models and techniques are developed in the present thesis for a range of multi-disciplinary problems utilising the adopted methodology. The research gaps and objectives are formulated specifically for each problem and discussed in separate chapters of this thesis. The solution of each of these problems represents an original and substantial contribution towards the respective area of research. The significant outcomes of this thesis include: a new approach for the analysis of reinforced cracks in layered media, a new mechanism for height control of hydraulic fractures in layered hydrocarbon reservoirs, and a new predictive model for skier-triggered avalanches. The original contributions of this thesis also include a new fundamental solution for an interfacial edge dislocation, which recovers all previously published solutions for edge dislocations in isotropic multilayered media. The obtained solution can be utilised to derive the governing integral equations {{for a wide variety of}} quasi-static crack problems in linearly elastic and isotropic <b>multilayered</b> <b>materials,</b> without any restrictions on the crack orientation or number of elastic layers.
