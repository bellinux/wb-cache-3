50|$|Joseph Merwin was {{involved}} with marketing and manufacturing revolvers as early as 1856 when he formed an arms company known as Merwin & Bray. This company folded by 1874. In 1876 Merwin formed a partnership with William and Milan Hulbert, who owned 50% interest in Hopkins & Allen. Merwin and Hulbert not only designed firearms, but imported firearms, and retailed firearms and other goods in a large sporting goods endeavor. Merwin and Hulbert additionally purchased several firearms manufacturers. Author Art Phelps poses that if Merwin and Hulbert had not marked the revolvers with the <b>manufacturers</b> <b>name</b> 'Hopkins and Allen' (known for inexpensive and poor quality weapons), the Merwin Hulbert would be as well known as Colt, Smith & Wesson, and Remington.|$|E
50|$|Products within {{scope of}} the RoHS2 {{directive}} must display the CE mark, the <b>manufacturers</b> <b>name</b> and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the EU representative. The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to demonstrate conformity, known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to demonstrate conformity {{by the use of}} test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (EN50581:2012 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large.|$|E
