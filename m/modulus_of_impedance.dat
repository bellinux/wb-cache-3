40|$|The {{effects of}} frequency, clay content, clay type, ionic {{concentration}} and saturation on the complex impedance of various shaly sandstone rocks {{have been investigated}} in a detailed and systematic manner. Synthetic samples have been used, so as to allow full control over clay content, clay type and clay distribution, hi addition, selected outcrop and reservoir samples with varying concentrations of clay were also used. Experimental measurements of complex impedance were made {{as a function of}} applied stress and saturation, for samples having differing amounts of clay, over a frequency range from 10 Hz to 2 MHz. In addition, the influence of ionic concentration (salinity) was also investigated. The <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>impedance</b> for the bulk sample response for fully saturated samples was frequency independent in the frequency range from approximately 10 kHz to 600 kHz. A strong linear correlation between the average complex impedance values and clay content was observed, with clay type influencing the magnitude of impedance. However, the reactance and dielectric constant were strongly frequency dependent. They both exhibited a power law dependency with frequency for the montmorillonite and illite synthetic shaly samples. It was possible to deduce correlations between the exponents from the reactance with clay content, {{and to a lesser extent}} clay type. The illite shaly samples usually showed the highest dielectric constant values, with the lowest belonging to the kaolinite samples. All samples showed strong relationships with salinity as the concentration was varied from 60, 000 ppm to 15, 000 ppm, with the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>impedance</b> increasing as salinity decreased. The bulk sample response was frequency independent over all salinity concentrations. The dielectric constant showed increasing values as the salinity decreased, with a power law relationship best fitting the data. As the samples were desaturated, a frequency dependency developed for the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>impedance</b> as a ftinction of saturation. As the samples were de-saturated the dielectric values decreased in magnitude. The concept of double layer thickness, and the variation in the cationic exchange capacity (CEC) with brine salinity and clay type, were used to explain the responses observed. Using this concept, the data was modelled using equivalent RC circuit models, and an impedance network model. It was found possible to model the data using combinations of capacitors and resistors.

40|$|Superhydrophobic {{aluminum}} alloy surfaces are obtained by chemical etching using 1 M NaOH solution followed by passivation using 0. 01 M ethanolic stearic acid (SA) solution. The formation of low surface energy aluminum stearate takes {{place during the}} passivation process between stearic acid and hydroxyl group terminated {{aluminum alloy}} surfaces. A schematic model of the SA passivation process on the –OH terminated Al-surfaces is presented in this work. The flake-like micro-nanostructure morphology of the low surface energy aluminum stearate increases the water contact angle by more than 150 °, demonstrating the superhydrophobic properties. The corrosion current density reduces and polarization resistance increase systematically with increasing passivation time. The polarization resistance, calculated from the Tafel curve of the superhydrophobic surfaces prepared by stearic acid passivation for 60 min, is determined to be 137 times larger {{than that of the}} as-received aluminum alloy substrate. Similarly, the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>impedance,</b> as determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is found be 70 times larger for the superhydrophobic surfaces compared to the as-received aluminum alloy surface.

40|$|Bipolar {{material}} impedance {{measurements are}} easier to implement than tetrapolar measurements but are more affected by electrode impedance. This effect can be reduced by measuring at a high-enough frequency albeit with the risk of deviations due to stray capacitances. High frequency measurements intended to reduce the influence of material conductivity when its permittivity is of interest also suffer {{from the effects of}} parasitic capacitances. In this paper, the effect of stray capacitance to ground in bipolar material impedance measurements implemented with direct-contact electrodes has been analyzed to identify the relevant parameters that determine the best frequency range to measure the conductivity or permittivity of the material when impedance analyzers based on an auto-balancing bridge are used. Stray capacitance to ground yields inductive effects proportional to it and also resistive and capacitive effects. If the ratio between this stray capacitance and the capacitance of the material under test is high enough, the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the measured <b>impedance</b> can display a peak at relatively low frequency (about 100 kHz) and its phase angle can become positive. The consequences are that the best estimate of the conductivity of the material is that obtained from the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impedance</b> at about midrange between the characteristic frequency of electrodes and that of the material, whereas the permittivity cannot be estimated from the impedance modulus measured at high frequency unless the sample capacitance is much larger than its capacitance to ground and propagation effects are negligible.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate a noninvasive measurement <b>of</b> cerebrovascular <b>impedance</b> and wave reflection in mice using high-frequency ultrasound in the left common carotid artery (LCCA), and to examine whether microvascular changes associated with hypercapnia could be detected with such an approach. Ten mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J) were studied using a high-frequency ultrasound system (40 MHz). Lumen area and blood flow waveforms were obtained from the LCCA and used to calculate pulse-wave velocity, input impedance, and reflection amplitude and transit time under both normocapnic and hypercapnic (5 % CO 2) ventilation. With hypercapnia, vascular resistance was observed to decrease by 87 % ± 12 %. Although the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> input <b>impedance</b> was unchanged with hypercapnia, a phase decrease indicative of increased total arterial compliance was observed at low harmonics together with an increased reflection coefficient in both the time (0. 57 ± 0. 08 versus 0. 68 ± 0. 08, P = 0. 04) and frequency domains (0. 62 ± 0. 08 versus 0. 73 ± 0. 06, P = 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Critical closing {{pressure}} (CCP) denotes a threshold of arterial blood pressure (ABP) below which brain vessels collapse and {{cerebral blood flow}} ceases. Theoretically, CCP {{is the sum of}} intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial wall tension (WT). The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the behavior of CCP and WT during spontaneous increases of ICP, termed plateau waves, in order to quantify ischemic risk. Methods: To calculate CCP, we used a recently introduced multi-parameter method (CCPm) which is based on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> cerebrovascular <b>impedance.</b> CCP is derived from cerebral perfusion pressure, ABP, transcranial Doppler estimators of cerebrovascular resistance and compliance, and heart rate. Arterial WT was estimated as CCPm-ICP. The clinical data included recordings of ABP, ICP, and transcranial Doppler-based blood flow velocity from 38 events of ICP plateau waves, recorded in 20 patients after head injury. Results: Overall, CCPm increased significantly from 51. 89 ± 8. 76 mmHg at baseline ICP to 63. 31 ± 10. 83 mmHg at the top of the plateau waves (mean ± SD; p < 0. 001). Cerebral arterial WT decreased significantly during plateau waves by 34. 3 % (p < 0. 001), confirming their vasodilatatory origin. CCPm did not exhibit the non-physiologic negative values that have been seen with traditional methods for calculation, therefore rendered a more plausible estimation of CCP. Conclusions: Rising CCP during plateau waves increases the probability of cerebral vascular collapse and zero flow when the difference: ABP-CCP (the "collapsing margin") becomes zero or negative. 8 page(s...|$|R
