5|$|Life with <b>My</b> <b>Sister</b> Madonna, {{a book by}} Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted {{at number}} two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some {{friction}} between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. On December 15, 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50 million and £60 million, a figure that includes {{the value of the}} couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. Madonna and Guy Ritchie's marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by decree nisi at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. Madonna and Ritchie entered into a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then ages eight and three respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two will be joined by her daughter, Lourdes, from a previous relationship.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{continuum}} of dialects varies, typical features of AAVE grammar include an implicit copula (e.g., She <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> instead of She is <b>my</b> <b>sister),</b> simplification of the possessive form (e.g., my momma sister instead of my mother's sister), and complexification of verb aspects and tenses beyond those of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like I'm a-run, I be running, etc.). Common features of the phonology include non-rhoticity (dropping the r sound {{at the end of}} syllables), metathesis (e.g., aks instead of ask), and simplification of diphthongs (e.g., eye typically sounds like ah).|$|E
