40|$|<b>Myelocystocele</b> {{is a rare}} {{variety of}} spinal dysraphism that {{presents}} as a skin covered, midline, lumbosacral mass. Many a time it is associated with other congenital anomalies but isolated <b>myelocystocele</b> is rarely associated with neurological deficit. MRI is the modality of choice for preoperative diagnosis. A 3 years old female child presented with skin covered lumbosacral mass since birth. There was no associated neurological deficit. MRI revealed single cyst, which was continuous with central canal of spinal cord. Peroperatively, <b>myelocystocele</b> was found with tethering of cord.

40|$|SUMMARY: This case {{exemplifies the}} {{difficulty}} in differentiating cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma and terminal <b>myelocystocele.</b> Fetal sonography presentation and perinatal risks of sacrococcygeal tera-toma and terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> are compared, and we {{emphasize the importance of}} obtaining fetal MR imaging to establish an accurate diagnosis. The terminal spine presents unique imaging challenges, par-ticularly in the case of large cystic masses. In the first case, an isolated terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> mimicked a cystic sacro-coccygeal teratoma (SCT) on prenatal sonography. The sec-ond case of type 2 (SCT) is presented for comparison. We discuss the presentation and perinatal risks of these 2 cystic sacrococcygeal masses and illustrate surgical correction of a cystic terminal <b>myelocystocele...</b>|$|E

A 2. 5 months old female baby presented with lumbosacral skin covered mass. There were no associated neurological deficits. MRI of the lesion suggested two cysts, {{one of which was}} continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. At operation terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> was found with tethering of the spinal cord.

40|$|Terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> {{is a rare}} form of occult spinal dysraphism {{in which}} the hydromyelic caudal spinal cord and the subarachnoid space are hemiated through a {{posterior}} spina bifida. A 1. 5 month old boy presented with a large lumbosacral mass and urinary incontinence. The magnetic resonance imaging, operative findings and pathological findings revealed a low lying conus with a dilated central canal dorsally attached to the subcutaneous tissue. Ventral subarachnoid space was enlarged and herniated through the laminar defect of the sacrum. The lesion was typical of a terminal <b>myelocystocele.</b> The clinical features {{are different from those}} of myelomeningocele in many aspects. Though the incidence is low, terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of congenital lesions presenting as a lumbosacral mass...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{here have}} {{reported}} a rare {{case of a}} child with a complex spina bifida with two different levels of split cord malformation (SCM) type 1 and single level type 2, a non terminal <b>myelocystocele,</b> coccygeal dermal sinus, bifid fatty filum and hydrocephalus, which substantiates the neuroenteric canal theory and have further tried to highlight the importance of complete Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening of the whole spine and brain with SCM to rule out other associated conditions. The patient was admitted with a leaking <b>myelocystocele</b> with bilateral lower limb weakness. MRI of whole spine with screening of brain was done. Patient underwent 5 operations in the same sitting- (According to classification given by Mahapatra et al.) removal of SCM type 1 a at D 7 - 8; removal of SCM type 1 c at L 2 - 3; removal of SCM type 2 at D 10; repair of non terminal <b>myelocystocele</b> at D 6 -D 10; low pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunt on right side with excision of dermal coccygeal sinus; and, excision of bifid fatty filum. The clinicoradiological findings in our patient further substantiate the multiple accessory neuroenteric canal theory in the development of composite type of SCM. The physical and neurological signs of SCM and nonterminal <b>myelocystocele</b> should prompt the neurosurgeon to consider performing the screening MRI of whole spine with brain to rule out other composite types of SCM and hydrocephalus...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prenatal evolution/natural history and postnatal outcome of fetuses {{diagnosed with a}} neural tube defect (NTD) lacking the Arnold-Chiari-II malformation (ACM II). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 16 fetuses evaluated with ultrasound (US) and MRI at a single referral center from 1 / 2000 to 8 / 2007. Follow-up studies and available postnatal outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Postpartum diagnosis was terminal myelocystoceles 7 / 16 (44 %); myelomeningoceles (MMCs) 3 / 16 (19 %); lipomyelomeningoceles 2 / 16 (13 %); and thoracic <b>myelocystocele</b> 1 / 16 (6 %). Three patients (19 %) were lost to follow-up or termination of pregnancy. Two prenatally diagnosed 'closed' NTD were postnatally found to be MMCs. Three of the myelocystoceles had additional omphalocele, bladder extrophy, imperforate anus and spinal defect (OEIS complex). For the total cohort, impaired lower extremity function was seen in 38 %, impaired bladder function in 64 %, and ventriculoperitoneal shunting in 8 %. Four fetuses with a <b>myelocystocele</b> developed hindbrain herniation in the third trimester of pregnancy. The preterm delivery rate was 38 %. Five of eight (63 %) neonates with postnatally diagnosed myelocystoceles had mothers with a body mass index over 30. CONCLUSION: Prenatal differentiation between closed and open NTD is not always possible. Postnatal outcome of isolated <b>myelocystocele</b> and MMC {{seems to be more}} favorable than for an NTD with ACM II (shunt requirement). Incontinence is the major childhood morbidity. Maternal obesity may be a risk factor for closed NTDs...|$|E
40|$|Cervical meningoceles {{are rare}} spinal dysraphism, {{accounting}} for approximately 7 % of all cystic spinal dysraphism. In {{spite of the}} rarity, the clinical course is {{most of the times}} benign. The surgical treatment includes resection of the lesion and untethering, when presented. We present a 14 -day-old female child with true meningoceles who underwent to surgical excision and dura-mater repair. Retrospect analysis of the literature concerning true cervical meningocele is performed. By reporting this illustrative case, we focus on its classification and its differentiation from other types of cervical spinal dysraphism, such as <b>myelocystocele</b> and myelomeningocele. Although its course is benign, it is mandatory a continuum follow up with periodic magnetic resonance imaging of spinal cord, since late neurological deterioration has been described...|$|E
30|$|The {{second type}} is a {{meningocele}} with cutaneous lining. These lesions are herniated sacs of cerebrospinal fluid lined with meninges and skin. They are usually posterior herniations and are most commonly {{located in the}} thoracic spine [32]. Anterior meningoceles are much less common and tend to {{be located in the}} presacral region [44]. The third type, <b>myelocystocele</b> (Fig.  7), consists of the herniation of a segment of the spinal cord with a dilated ependymal canal within a meningocele [32]; these lesions can occur at any point in the spine [45]. Myelocystoceles are similar to myelomeningoceles; the two entities are differentiated by the thickness of the wall of the herniated sac (Fig.  7 b), the absence of the Chiari malformation, and the absence of elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels [1, 9]. Myelocystoceles can be associated with cloacal anomalies [46].|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a retrospective analysis}} of the presentation, imaging studies, and associated findings in 20 children with surgically and histologically proven terminal myelocystoceles. All 20 children presented at birth with a black mass; 13 had cloacal extrophy. The patient population was comprised of 15 girls and 5 with ambiguous genitalia: Of the imaging studies, 8 had plain radiographs, 6 myelography-computed tomography, 11 ultrasound, and 14 magnetic resonance. The associated findings included Chiari I (eight patients), Chiari II (one patient), hydromyelia (three patients), hydrocephalus (three patients), and vertebral segmentation anomalies (six patients). Magnetic resonance imaging was the best imaging modality to diagnose and evaluate children with a <b>myelocystocele.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the classic findings: a terminal cyst of the central canal of the spinal cord that is tethered and herniated with arachnoid and cerebrospinal fluid through an area of spinal dysphria onto the back as a mass...|$|E
40|$|Spinal dysraphism {{includes}} anomalies of midline fusion involving bony, mesenchymal, and neural elements. MR imaging of {{the spine}} was performed as the initial imaging technique to determine {{its role in the}} evaluation of 31 children when spinal dysraphism was clinically suspected or when radiographs revealed errors of ossification of the posterior elements (spina bifida). Correlation of surgical findings in 17 of 18 abnormal examinations and metrizamide myelography with CT in six of these cases indicated that accurate diagnosis was provided by MR in all instances. Examples of spina bifida aperta (spina bifida cystica) -including myelomeningocele, <b>myelocystocele,</b> and lipomyelo-meningocele-and those of occult spinal dysraphism-such as dorsal dermal sinus, spinal lipoma, and tight filum terminale (thickened filum) -are presented. These cases show MR to be a reliable technique in the initial evaluation of these disorders. MR imaging in children with clinically and/or radiographically suspected spinal dysraphism offers a noninvasive technique for evaluating the spine. This procedure can provide a definitive diagnosis without the hazards of ionizing radiation or intrathecal injection of contrast media. Although plain radiographs are helpful in th...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. In the U. S. alone, {{approximately}} 1500 infants {{are born}} with SB each year. An estimated 166, 000 individuals with SB live in the United States. Background. The BCH-SBPR was established in August 2015 to help increase knowledge about new procedures, surgeries and treatment options, growing up with Spina Bifida, and to guide healthcare practices by prospectively studying a cohort of children born with this condition. Objective. The objective of this project is to collect comprehensive longitudinal clinical data (demographics, treatments, and outcomes) from a multi- disciplinary clinic on patients with SB. Design: Prospective longitudinal design. Data collection will occur every six months. Methods. Study subjects include children whose ages range from birth to 35 years {{with one of the}} following six SB diagnoses: Myelomeningocele, Meningocele, Lipoma of Spinal Cord, Fatty Thickened Filum, Split Cord Malformation, and Terminal <b>Myelocystocele</b> will be eligible to participate. Results. 653 patients were enrolled in this registry. 635 patients were enrolled in this registry. 66 patients were randomly selected to conduct a descriptive analysis. The mean age was 9. 7 (7. 63 SD). The majority of the patients 2 ̆ 7 age were between 5 and 13 years old (40...|$|E
40|$|Background:Cystic dys-raphic lesions of the {{cervical}} {{and upper}} thoracic region are rare {{and only a}} few series have been published about the topic. These malformations can be divided into categories that include both myelocystoceles and the so-called cervical meningoceles or myelomeningoceles. Methods:A retrospective study of 18 patients was conducted. Results:In 17 patients a squamous or a cicatricial epithelium of variable thickness covered the dome of the lesions, while the base was covered with full-thickness skin. In one case the skin was entirely normal. Four patients displayed asso-ciated CNS malformations and three more had systemic congenital anomalies. All patients underwent surgical exploration and the length of time between birth and surgery ranged from 6 h to 9 months. The most frequent surgical finding, seen in 14 patients, was a stalk connecting the dorsal surface of the spinal cord to the cyst. In three patients the findings were consistent with <b>myelocystocele.</b> Only in one case was a true menin-gocele found. Hydrocephalus and Chiari II malformation were not as consistently associated as in myelo-meningoceles. Neurological signs and symptoms were not so marked as in myelomeningoceles and were found in the follow-up of four patients. In two of them there was a non-pro-gressive deficit, probably expressing an imperceptible involvement of the nervous system {{in the first year of}} life. The histopathological findings were of three types: neuroglial stalks, fibrovascular stalks and myelocysto-celes. Conclusions:Cystic dysraph-isms of the cervical and upper thoracic region differ clinically and structurally from meningomyelocele and have a more favorable outcome. We believe that these malformations have not been properly labeled and propose a classification based on the structures found inside the cyst...|$|E
