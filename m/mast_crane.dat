40|$|Abstract. <b>Mast</b> <b>crane</b> {{integral}} installation technology {{is one of}} the ten new technologies in the construction field, which are put forward by the ministry of construction and are in key application. It is widely applied in the field of construction engineering. However, at present, the design of the <b>mast</b> <b>crane</b> hoisting is generally based on traditional mechanical model and adopts manual calculation, which is lack of safety and reliability, and the model needs to be perfect. As a result, this paper studies the lattice <b>mast</b> <b>crane</b> hoisting system, explores and improves the traditional mechanical model, and develops the lattice mast hoisting aided design system (WGCAD 1. 0), {{in order to meet the}} design requirements. Main content includes: introduction to the development in engineering of the lattice mast hoisting crane and the application status in hoisting engineering of computer technology; introduction of the development environment of ViusalBasi 6. 0 and Access database which are used in cad system development of the lattice mast hoisting. By using the reasonable lattice mast lifting design mechanics model, from the lattice mast hoisting system designer's perspective, the software adopts Visual Basic 6. 0 development environment and Microsoft Access database as development tools, the design idea of engineering design are simulated...|$|E
40|$|For {{offshore}} installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class {{heavy lift crane}} vessels. The objects {{that need to be}} installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board heavy lift crane and slewed {{to the side of the}} ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the slewing crane, the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2 D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static heeling angle. The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static heeling angle could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2. 25 to 3. 25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1 o were used, while the <b>mast</b> <b>crane</b> proved to handle roll angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.

5000|$|Earlier the {{building}} of sailing ships had not required sheers to erect their mast, {{as it could be}} lifted into place by ropes and allowed to pivot around its foot. As ships became larger, it was no longer possible to mount their masts, taller and heavier, in this fashion. A crane was needed, tall enough to lift the entire mast vertically and then lower it into the ship. It was as a consequence of this development that the <b>Masting</b> <b>Crane</b> on Nyholm was erected in 1748-51. In the late 19th century, the increasing size and capacity of general harbour cranes began to overlap with the lofty but lightweight masting sheers and so their specialisation was no longer required.

40|$|A visual {{environment}} for maritime helicopter real-time flight simulation is presented and evaluated. For offshore helicopter operations, simulators have {{to replicate the}} flight through obstacle scenery (e. g. radio <b>masts,</b> <b>cranes,</b> rotating wind turbine blades…), and landing on a helideck with limited visual cues due to the natural environment. Poor modeling of moving obstacles or helidecks further increases the problems the pilots are faced to, resulting in "false learning" close to moving obstacles and helidecks. The paper focuses on {{the development and implementation}} of an Offshore-Scenario, taking into account complexity, real-time ability, and realism. Based on a thorough investigation of maritime helicopter operations, an Offshore-Scenario which depicts the situation off German coast, was defined. It includes several dynamical components such as rotating wind turbine blades, wind generated waves, and moving ships and is therefore suitable for simulating common offshore helicopter operations. The decks and visual sea models within simulators are usually not realistic, with the helideck having a sinusoidal motion and the visual wave model moving independently. Contrary to the common practice, in this work, the deck motion is modeled as a response to the wave excitation...|$|R

They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the objective's focal length 4 times as long (focal length had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have focal lengths as long as 150 feet.

It also describes climbing equipment from protective gear, climbing ropes, climbing harness, snap-links, abseiling and climbing means, rescue means to knotting techniques. The aim of this thesis was to map the climbing equipment and material recourses for rescue at height and above the free depth, {{the skills of the}} climbing unit members and the number of interventions with the usage of rope and climbing techniques {{in the last five years}} at The Fire Rescue Service of the South Bohemian Region, The Air Rescue Service of the South Bohemian Region and The Special Reaction Unit of the Regional Police Directorate of the South Bohemian Police.

To obtain the results I used the method of qualitative research, which was conducted through semi-structured interviews with the members of the climbing units. The number of interventions of the primary components of the Integrated Rescue System of the Czech Republic using rope and climbing techniques is quite low, they are nevertheless treated as high-risk. For this reason is the preparation of the climbing units consistent and proper. It takes the form of frequent exercise.

40|$|Self {{loosening}} of prestressed bolts ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} self loosening of high strength bolts has been assessed since the 1940 ’s. Still {{a lot of}} questions are unsolved. This is especially the case in the field of bolts for steel structures with diameters of 16 to 36 mm, where the number of results is low. At risk for self loosening are steel structures under cyclic loads, such as <b>cranes,</b> <b>mast</b> constructions, smokestacks and bridges. To protect connections against the self loosening several antiloosening devices were on the market. Recent results showed that unfortunately almost all of them were malfunctioning. Due to that in 2003 all German regulations for these elements were withdrawn. At the moment a research project is running at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, to analyze the mechanism of self loosening. The aim is to find a constructive way to protect a bolted connection from self loosening. Therefore several tests to identify the important pa-rameters were performed, especially the variation of the clamping length.

40|$|The {{conveyance}} of payloads by construction cranes generates pendulations of the payload. This research {{provides a}} critical design parameter {{for the development}} of a device that aids in reduction of these pendulations. Previous research developed a tuned mass damping system, that effectively attenuated the energy of a pendulating payload. In order to be effective the internal damping rate of the tuned mass damper must be at least twice that of the system to be damped. Prototypes of a tuned mass damping system have achieved damping rates between 6 and 12 %, making cranes with damping rates below 3 % attractive. This research indicates that the internal damping rate of construction cranes is on the order of one percent, suggesting that a tuned mass damping system could be retrofitted to today's construction cranes. This thesis is an investigation of the internal damping rates of construction cranes. Three hydraulic and two lattice boom cranes were tested. The motion of pendulating payloadswas modeled after a simple pendulum. The internal damping rate was calculated using logarithmic decrement technique.

These documents, called Eurocodes, are systematically based on the recently developed Council Directive 89 / 106 /EEC “The Construction Product Directive” and its Interpretative Documents ID 1 and ID 2. Implementation of Eurocodes in each Member State is a demanding task as each country has its own long-term tradition in design and construction. The project should enable an effective implementation and application of the new methods for designing and verification of buildings and civil engineering works in all the partner countries (CZ, DE, ES, IT, NL) and in other Member States. The need to explain and effectively use the latest principles specified in Eurocodes standards is apparent from enterprises, undertakings and public national authorities involved in construction industry and also from university and colleges. Training materials, manuals and software programmes for education are urgently required. The submitted Guidebook 2 completes the set of two guidebooks intended to provide required manuals and software products for training, education and effective implementation of Eurocodes: Guidebook 1 : Load Effects on Buildings Guidebook 2 : Design of bridges. It is expected that the Guidebooks will address the following intents in further harmonization o f European construction industry: -	reliability improvement and unification {{of the process of}} design, -	development of a single market for product and for construction services, -	new opportunities for trained primary target groups in the labour market. The Guidebook 2 is focused on determining load effects on road, railway and pedestrian bridges and special civil structures. The following main topics are discussed in particular: -	basic requirements on bridges, -	basis of structural design, -	traffic loads for static and fatigue assessment, -	non traffic actions, -	accidental actions, -	combination rules for bridges, -	examples and case studies. Annex A to Guidebook 2 concerns new traffic trends in European traffic and their consequence on bridge design and on assessment of existing bridges, Annex B provides basic information about action and combination rules for special structures, like <b>cranes,</b> <b>masts,</b> towers and pipelines. The Guidebook 2 is written in a user-friendly way employing only basic mathematical tools, supplemented by examples and case studies developed in detail. A wide range of potential users of the Guidebooks and other training materials includes practising engineers, designers, technicians, experts of public authorities, young people – high school and university students. The target groups come from all territorial regions of the partner countries.
