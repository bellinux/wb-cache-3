25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E
2500|$|Suffolk {{police were}} called to the scene {{on the night of}} the initial {{sighting}} and again the following morning but found nothing unusual. On the night of the initial incident they reported that the only lights visible were from the Orford lighthouse. They attributed the indentations in the ground to animals. The Suffolk constabulary file on the case was released in 2005 under the UKâ€™s Freedom of Information Act and can be accessed on their website. It includes a letter dated 28 July 1999 written by Inspector Mike Topliss who notes that one of the police constables who attended the scene on the first night returned to the site in daylight in case he had <b>missed</b> <b>something.</b> [...] "There was nothing to be seen and he remains unconvinced that the occurrence was genuine," [...] wrote Topliss. [...] "The immediate area was swept by powerful light beams from a landing beacon at RAF Bentwaters and the Orfordness lighthouse. I know from personal experience that at night, in certain weather and cloud conditions, these beams were very pronounced and certainly caused strange visual effects." ...|$|E

60|$|Thirlwell, {{examining}} the specimen, <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> of her meaning, {{and did not}} see that her decision to show him the ore was a compliment. He looked honest, and strangers often trusted him. His friends had never known him abuse their confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not afraid," [...] said Beatrice. [...] "If I {{stayed at}} Allenwood, I should not escape. Perhaps I have <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> by getting through life too easily. I really don't think I'm much weaker, or less capable, than Effie Broadwood, and she's not cast down." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{there was}} anxiety in his voice, as though Shelton {{were in danger}} of <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> good. The latter's feet had {{instantly}} begun to ache and burn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was wondering," [...] he began, [...] "why I <b>miss</b> <b>something</b> when I look round this {{beautiful}} room; something familiar, you know, that I fully {{expected to find}} here." ...|$|R
60|$|But, as the {{sunlight}} left {{the peaks of}} the Seven Gables, so did the excitement fade out of Clifford's eyes. He gazed vaguely and mournfully about him, as if he <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> precious, and missed it the more drearily for not knowing precisely what it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! you see you <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> by {{not coming}} to stay there as we did. And {{to tell you a}} great secret, Marian, Louisa says she really {{believes}} that it was you that her brother thought of, when he first accepted Elliot's invitation to come and stay here." ...|$|E
60|$|At last he went. They {{shook hands}} {{with each other in}} their {{accustomed}} manner, but Wilkinson felt that he <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> from her touch, some warmth from the soft pressure, some scintillation of sympathy which such last moments of his visits had usually communicated to him. Yes; there was much to miss.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{only problem}} with looking for sea glass...is that you never look up. You never see the view. You never see the houses or the ocean, because you're afraid you'll <b>miss</b> <b>something</b> in the sand." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{while he}} stood, {{grasping}} her arm, seemingly {{intent on the}} head of the procession, he was quivering with the sense of always <b>missing</b> <b>something,</b> with instinctive regret that he had not got them both.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{another method}} for resolving this problem {{was to have}} an expert human judge the final board. However, this {{introduces}} subjectivity into the results and {{the risk that the}} expert would <b>miss</b> <b>something</b> the program saw.|$|R
60|$|He was {{no longer}} {{thinking}} of the Germans as diabolical. They were human; they had a case. It was a stupid case, but our case, too, was a stupid case. How stupid were all our cases! What was it we <b>missed?</b> <b>Something,</b> he felt, very close to us, and very elusive. Something that would resolve a hundred tangled oppositions....|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there were}} more there would be too many to convey the {{impression}} in which half the beauty resides--the impression, somehow, of something dreamed and <b>missed,</b> <b>something</b> reduced, relinquished, resigned: the poetry, as it were, of something sensibly gone." [...] Fleda ingeniously and triumphantly worked it out. [...] "Ah, there's something here {{that will never be}} in the inventory!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{tone of the}} {{question}} was singularly flattering to our hero, who felt it to imply the great man's now perceiving he had for years <b>missed</b> <b>something.</b> [...] "Partly, I suppose, {{because there has been}} no particular reason why you should see me. I haven't lived in the world--in your world. I've spent many years out of England, in different places abroad." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were in our}} places {{hours before}} the start (he was like a boy on Circus Day--afraid of <b>missing</b> <b>something),</b> {{but that he was}} enjoying in high degree his {{comfortable}} outlook, made me almost equally content.|$|R
6000|$|... "La, Miss Briggs," [...] {{the girl}} exclaimed, [...] "O, <b>Miss,</b> <b>something</b> must have happened--there's nobody in Miss Sharp's room; the bed ain't been slep in, and she've run away, and left this letter for you, Miss." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{drove the}} burros {{at a good}} trot, his mind at once busy and absent, happy with the {{pictures}} of that last hour, gloomy with the undefined, unsatisfied cravings of his heart. Friendship with Neale, affection for Allie, acquainted him {{with the fact that}} he had <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> in life--not friendship, for he had had hunter friends, but love, perhaps of a sweetheart, surely love of a daughter.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not let it}} be {{surmised that}} I attach any great value to such banter {{as she had been}} indulging in. At the same time, however, I had an uneasy feeling that I had <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> which might have been to my advantage. It was in vain that I whipped my dull senses; but one {{conclusion}} was indicated by all this inference, and I don't care even to mention that: it was preposterous.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} help noticing that Washington was a city full of {{beautiful}} girls. His idolatry of Miss Wilbur could not prevent him from admiring them as they streamed along the walk to church. He sometimes looked wistfully at this flood of sunny laughing life that moved by him so near and yet so completely out of his reach. He knew at such times that he had <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> sweet {{out of his own}} lonely life.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very nearly, sir. He did {{not like}} my leaving him at all. He was afraid of <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> worth seeing. Besides, he did not ask {{to come into the}} house at all, not even to see the pictures. He spent all his time in the ruins.|$|R
50|$|In its mild form, {{homesickness}} prompts {{the development}} of coping skills and motivates healthy attachment behaviors, such as renewing contact with loved ones. Indeed, nearly all people <b>miss</b> <b>something</b> about home when they are away, making homesickness a nearly universal experience. However, intense homesickness can be painful and debilitating.|$|R
60|$|Almayer {{gathered}} in the rope intelligently enough, but when the pony's hoofs touched the wharf he gave way all at once to a most foolish optimism. Without pausing, without thinking, almost without looking, he disengaged the hook suddenly from the sling, and the cargo-chain, after hitting the pony's quarters, swung back against the ship's side with a noisy, rattling slap. I suppose I must have blinked. I know I <b>missed</b> <b>something,</b> because the next thing I saw was Almayer lying {{flat on his back}} on the jetty. He was alone.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas {{looked upon}} the sleepers; at first, {{with the air}} of one who gazes upon a scene which, though {{familiar}} to him, has lost none of its sorrowful effect in consequence; and, afterwards, with a more intense and searching scrutiny, as a man would who <b>missed</b> <b>something</b> his eye was accustomed to meet, and had expected to rest upon. He was still occupied in this search, and had half risen from his bed in the eagerness of his quest, when the voice of Squeers was heard, calling {{from the bottom of}} the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old man had}} now raised {{himself from}} the ground, and, looking about {{him as if he}} <b>missed</b> <b>something,</b> seemed {{gradually}} to recover the sense of his wretchedness. [...] "Where," [...] he said, with a voice that made the roof ring, [...] "where is the vile harlot, that has disgraced the blood of an honest man?--Where is she, that has no place among us, but has come foul with her sins, like the Evil One, among the children of God?--Where is she, Jeanie?--Bring her before me, that I may kill her with a word and a look!" ...|$|E
60|$|I awoke, {{oppressed by}} a mysterious sensation. There seemed <b>something</b> <b>missing</b> in my environment. But the mystery and oppressiveness {{vanished}} {{after the first}} few seconds of waking, when I identified the <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> as the wind. I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve tension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement, and I had awakened, still tense, bracing myself to meet the pressure of something which no longer bore upon me.|$|R
