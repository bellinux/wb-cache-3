5|$|Beer {{contains}} the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid. Alkaline hydrolysis experiments {{show that most}} of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds. Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains <b>myrcene,</b> humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
25|$|The {{process begins}} by forming an allylic amine from <b>myrcene,</b> which {{undergoes}} asymmetric isomerisation {{in the presence}} of a BINAP rhodium complex to give (after hydrolysis) enantiomerically pure R-citronellal. This is cyclised by a carbonyl-ene-reaction initiated by zinc bromide to isopulegol, which is then hydrogenated to give pure (1R,2S,5R)-menthol.|$|E
25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), limonene, p-cymene, and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and monoterpene derivatives (α-pinene, <b>myrcene,</b> terpinene, thymol, camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock. Ascaridole content is lower in epazote from Mexico than in epazote grown in Europe or Asia.|$|E
500|$|Fragrances are {{predominantly}} monoterpene isoprenoids, {{with a small}} amount of benzenoids, although N. jonquilla has both equally represented. Another exception is N. cuatrecasasii which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives. The basic monoterpene precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate, and the commonest monoterpenes are limonene, <b>myrcene,</b> and trans-β-ocimene. Most benzenoids are non-methoxylated, while a few species contain methoxylated forms (ethers), e.g. [...] N. bugei. Other ingredient include indole, isopentenoids and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators, and fall into three main groups (see Pollination).|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of hops essential oils are terpene hydrocarbons consisting of <b>myrcene,</b> humulene and caryophyllene. <b>Myrcene</b> {{is responsible for}} the pungent smell of fresh hops. Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma. Together, <b>myrcene,</b> humulene, and caryophyllene represent 80 to 90% of the total hops essential oil.|$|E

50|$|Isomeric with nerol is geraniol, {{wherein the}} double bond is trans. Nerol readily loses water to form dipentene. Nerol can be {{synthesized}} by pyrolysis of beta-pinene, which affords <b>myrcene.</b> Hydrochlorination of <b>myrcene</b> gives {{a series of}} isomeric chlorides, one of which converts to neryl acetate.|$|E
50|$|Many plants contain <b>myrcene,</b> {{sometimes}} in substantial amounts.|$|E

50|$|Plants biosynthesize <b>myrcene</b> via geranyl {{pyrophosphate}} (GPP). The mevalonate pathway {{gives the}} precursors dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1a) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (Fig.1b). These two precursors combine to produce GPP (Fig. 1c), which then isomerizes into linalyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1d). The rearrangement and {{release of the}} pyrophosphate (OPP), and the double bond formation creates the product <b>myrcene</b> (Fig. 1e).|$|E
5000|$|In enzymology, a <b>myrcene</b> synthase (...) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{chemical}} reaction ...|$|E
50|$|Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranyl diphosphate, and two products, <b>myrcene</b> and diphosphate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Myrcene</b> is an {{important}} intermediate used in the perfumery industry. It has a pleasant odor, but is rarely used directly. It is also unstable in air, tending to polymerize. Samples are stabilized {{by the addition of}} alkylphenols or tocopherol. It is thus more highly valued as an intermediate for the preparation of flavor and fragrance chemicals such as menthol, citral, citronellol, citronellal, geraniol, nerol, and linalool. <b>Myrcene</b> is converted to myrcenol, another fragrance found in lavender, via uncatalyzed hydroamination of the 1,3-diene followed by hydrolysis and Pd-catalyzed removal of the amine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myrcene,</b> or β-myrcene, is an {{olefinic}} natural organic hydrocarbon. It is {{more precisely}} {{classified as a}} monoterpene. Monoterpenes are dimers of isoprenoid precursors, and <b>myrcene</b> is a significant component of the essential oil of several plants, including bay, cannabis, ylang-ylang, wild thyme, parsley, cardamom, and hops. It is produced mainly semi-synthetically from myrcia, from which it gets its name. It is a key intermediate {{in the production of}} several fragrances. α-Myrcene is the name for the structural isomer 2-methyl-6-methylene-1,7-octadiene, which is not found in nature and is little used.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil derived from leaves contains terpinen-4-ol (36.0%), sabinene (19.2%), γ-terpinene (10.4%), α-terpinene (5.5%) and <b>myrcene</b> (5.5%). The wood oil contains thujopsene (47.1%), α-cedrol (10.7%), widdrol (8.5%) and cuparene (4.0%).|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil {{that can be}} obtained from the leaves contains β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and α-pinene. The major compounds found in the {{essential oil}} from the seeds are α-phellandrene, α-pinene, <b>myrcene,</b> limonene and pinene.|$|E
50|$|Iso E Super is {{produced}} commercially by Diels-Alder reaction of <b>Myrcene</b> with 3-Methyl-3-penten-2-one {{in the presence}} of aluminum chloride to give a monocyclic intermediate that is cyclized {{in the presence of}} 85% phosphoric acid.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} Cascade has been {{propagated}} in Tasmania, Australia. It has similar resultant characteristics to the US variety. The Tasmanian variety contains less <b>myrcene</b> oil and more humulene oil {{as well as}} other more minor differences.|$|E
50|$|The rind's cold-pressed oil {{has been}} studied for {{fragrance}} factors, and was found to contain limonene (roughly 80%), followed by the monoterpene Gamma-terpinene (10%), trans beta-farnesene, and <b>myrcene,</b> showing similarity to Hyuganatsu's peel profile, though with quantitative differences in concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|The leaf {{volatiles}} {{from which}} the name [...] "camphorweed" [...] is derived include camphor, but as a minor constituent (less than 2%); of 41 documented volatiles, for example, caryophyllene, pinene, borneol, <b>myrcene,</b> and limonene each comprised over 5% of the total.|$|E
50|$|Myrcenol is {{obtained}} synthetically from <b>myrcene</b> via hydroamination of the 1,3-diene followed by hydrolysis and Pd-catalysed {{removal of the}} amine. As a 1,3-dienes, mycenol undergoes Diels-Alder reactions with several dienophiles such as acrolein to give cyclohexene derivatives that are also useful fragrances.|$|E
5000|$|Spices, onion, garlic, tea tree, oak, cedar, locust, pine, {{and many}} other plants give off phytoncides. Oak {{contains}} a substance called greenery alcohol. Garlic contains allicin and diallyl disulfide. Sophora flavescens contains sophoraflavanone G. Pine contains alpha-pinene, carene, <b>myrcene,</b> and other terpenes.|$|E
50|$|In the {{essential}} oil of five different European hemp cultivars, the dominating terpenes were <b>myrcene</b> (21.1-35.0 %), α-pinene (7.2-14.6 %), α-terpinolene (7.0-16.6 %), trans-caryophyllene (12.2.-18.9 %), and α-humulene (6.1-8.7 %). The main {{differences between the}} cultivars {{were found in the}} contents of α-terpinolene and α-pinene.|$|E
50|$|Sixty-eight {{components}} were detected by GC and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) in fresh bud oil distilled from high-potency, indoor-grown hemp. The 57 identified constituents were 92% monoterpenes, 7% sesquiterpenes, and approx. 1% other compounds (ketones, esters). The dominating monoterpenes were <b>myrcene</b> (67%) and limonene (16%).|$|E
5000|$|Monoterpenes {{consist of}} two {{isoprene}} units {{and have the}} molecular formula C10H16. Examples of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids include geraniol, terpineol (present in lilacs), limonene (present in citrus fruits), <b>myrcene</b> (present in hops), linalool (present in lavender) or pinene (present in pine trees). Iridoids derive from monoterpenes.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} this {{can be found in the}} Ponderosa Pine tree (Pinus ponderosa), which {{produces}} a terpene called <b>myrcene</b> when it is damaged by the Western pine beetle. Instead of deterring the insect, it acts synergistically with aggregation pheromones which in turn act to lure more beetles to the tree.|$|E
50|$|Terpenes arise {{naturally}} from dehydration of terpenol geraniol. It {{could in}} principle be extracted from {{any number of}} plants, for example wild thyme, the leaves of which contain up to 40% by weight of <b>myrcene.</b> The current route to commercial samples is by the pyrolysis (400 °C) of β-pinene, which is obtained from turpentine.|$|E
