50|$|The MXB-1 <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Board</b> was {{designed}} {{by a member of}} the VDUEB Users' Club. The MXB-1 contained space for extra EPROMs, an optional battery backed real time clock, a centronics compatible printer interface and address decoding for up to 192kB of RAM. The extra RAM was installed by replacing the standard 4116 16k × 1 bit RAM chips with 4164 64k × 1 bit RAM chips. The CPU's 64kB address limit was worked around through bank switching. The MXB-1 was mostly of benefit to users running the CP/M disk operating system, since CP/M could then have a full 64kB of RAM for programs, with up to 128kB being used as a small RAM disk.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [86]- 88). DSP {{technology has}} evolved at a tremendous pace in the recent past. Increased clock speeds and processing power due to architectural enhancements have made the implementation of computationally intensive algorithms in real time a reality. Echo cancellation is one such application that has immensely benefited from this phenomenon. The main motivation for this thesis {{was to develop a}} floating-point DSP system suitable for acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) in teleconferencing applications. Floatingpoint DSP was chosen as it offers a wider dynamic range for the input signal than its fixed-point counterparts. Conventionally, two input/output (I/O) ports are required in the DSP chip to facilitate echo cancellation. In this project, an AEC system was designed and implemented using a DSP chip with one I/O port only. This was made possible by using the A/D-D/A converters in a ?master-slave? topology. A <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>board</b> was designed to accommodate the large memory needs. Issues involved in real-time implementation of echo cancellers are also discussed. In addition to discussing some of the theoretical aspects of echo cancellation algorithms, this thesis also compares the effect of fixed-point and floating-point implementations of adaptive algorithms. The effects of finite precision, quantization and dynamic range on the performance of digital filters are also discussed. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

5000|$|IBM {{recognized}} {{soon after}} the IBM PC's release in 1981 that its five 8-bit [...] "I/O channel" [...] expansion slots (later named Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) by IBM's competitors) were insufficient. An internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 about the number that [...] "In my opinion, {{it could be a}} problem", reporting that others within IBM advised swapping cards if necessary. Virtually every PC required at least a display adapter card and a floppy disk controller card, leaving only three slots available for a parallel printer port card (if the Color Graphics Adapter was used), a serial port card, <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>boards,</b> a 3rd-party hard disk controller card, a second display adapter card, or possible other special adapter cards.|$|R
50|$|The Compaq Portable II had {{room for}} {{additional}} after market upgrades. Compaq manufactured four <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>boards,</b> 512kB and 2048kB ISA memory cards and 512kB and 1536kB memory boards that {{attached to the}} back of the motherboard. With 640kB installed on the motherboard and both the ISA card and the <b>expansion</b> <b>board,</b> the computer could be upgraded with up to a maximum of 4.2MB of RAM. The motherboard also had space for an optional 80287 math coprocessor. There were two revisions of the motherboard, they were functionally identical although the earlier version was larger. The motherboard had four ISA slots for expansion cards, two 8-bit and two 16-bit. However, the first 16-bit slot was already occupied by a CGA graphics card and one of the 8-bit slots was used by the ATA drive controller board, leaving two available to add cards to. The keyboard is hardwired in but it uses standard PS/2 signaling, so a DIN or PS/2 socket can be retrofitted to allow use of common PS/2 keyboards (but not USB ones).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} a cached IO subsystem on a cpu board of a high performance workstation. The cached IO subsystem is intended to reduce the memory latency for IO activity and minimize the number of processor cycles stolen by IO traffic to achieve a better balanced computer system {{in terms of both}} the cpu computation power and the system IO bandwidth. The model of the cached IO subsystem is shown to illustrate the system architecture. The discussion covers arbitration of system IO activity, the architecture of the virtual address accessed IO cache, the cache coherency algorithm, as well as the comparison of theoretical bounds of IO bandwidth and cpu degradation between different caching schemes. 1.

5000|$|The 8088 {{processor}} of the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT {{could address}} one Megabyte (MB or 220 bytes) of memory. It inherited this limit from the 20-bit {{external address bus}} of the Intel 8086. The designers of the PC allocated the lower 640 kB (655,360 bytes) of address space for read-write program memory (RAM), called [...] "conventional memory", and the remaining 384 kB of memory space was reserved for uses such as the system BIOS, video memory, and <b>memory</b> on <b>expansion</b> peripheral <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Introduced in September 1986 {{simultaneously}} with the Apple IIGS, this model {{introduced a new}} motherboard, new keyboard and new color scheme. The original Apple IIc had no expansion options and required third-party cards such as Legend Industries to perform various hardware tricks. This could be done by removing the CPU and MMU chips and inserting a special board into these sockets, which then used bank switching to expand memory up to 1 MegByte (RAM). This {{was similar to the}} function of the slots in the original Apple II, II+ as well as the auxiliary slot in the Apple IIe. The new motherboard added a 34-pin socket for plugging in memory cards directly, which allowed for the addressing of up to 1 megabyte (MB) of memory using Slinky-type memory cards. The onboard chip count was reduced from 16 memory chips (64K×1) to four (64K×4). The new firmware removed the code for the cancelled AppleTalk networking device and replaced it with support for memory cards. Bumping out the non-supported AppleTalk functionality, memory now lived in virtual slot 4, and mouse support moved to slot 7. The new keyboard no longer had the rubber anti-spill mat and offered generally more tactile and responsive keys that felt more “clicky.” At the same time, the color of the keyboard, floppy drive latch, and power supply cords changed from beige to light grey, which matched the new Platinum color scheme of the Apple IIGS. The case style, however, remained Snow White. Owners of the previous IIc model were entitled to a free motherboard upgrade if they purchased one of Apple’s IIc <b>memory</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>boards</b> (they did not receive the new keyboard or the cosmetic changes).|$|R
50|$|Many <b>expansion</b> <b>boards</b> were {{produced}} for Amiga computers {{to improve the}} performance and capability of the hardware, such as <b>memory</b> <b>expansions,</b> SCSI controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include genlocks, network cards for Ethernet, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are USB cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1745M, Eventide began widely using Random-access memory (RAM) chips {{in many of}} their products.

Therefore, Eventide began to manufacture and sell HP-compatible RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>boards</b> and did so from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|This {{insertion}} of a memory {{window into the}} peripheral address space could originally be accomplished only through specific <b>expansion</b> <b>boards,</b> plugged into the ISA expansion bus of the computer. Famous 1980s expanded memory boards were AST RAMpage, IBM PS/2 80286 <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> Option, AT&T Expanded Memory Adapter and the Intel Above Board. Given the price of RAM during the period, up to several hundred dollars per MiB, and the quality and reputation of the above brand names, an expanded memory board was very expensive.|$|R
50|$|While the Apple IIc {{had many}} {{built-in}} features to offer, many users wanted {{to extend the}} machine’s capabilities beyond what Apple provided. It proved difficult since the IIc was a closed system that initially was designed with no expansion capabilities in mind; however, many companies figured out ingenious ways of squeezing enhancements inside the tiny case. Real-time clocks, <b>memory</b> <b>expansion,</b> and coprocessors were popular, and some companies even managed to combine all three into a single add-on board. Typically, in order to add these options, key chips on the motherboard were pulled and moved onto the <b>expansion</b> <b>board</b> offering the new features, and the board was then placed into the empty sockets. While sometimes a tight squeeze, this trickery worked quite well, and most importantly of all offered users a way to expand memory—something Apple did not themselves support until the <b>Memory</b> <b>Expansion</b> IIc model was introduced.|$|R
