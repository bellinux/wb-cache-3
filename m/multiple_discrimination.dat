This was clear from the start, even before his setting up of GGR, when he actively held meetings with lawyers and other individuals to create interest in the setting up of a Gibraltar branch of British human rights organisation Liberty. Whilst that project did not prosper, Alvarez's vision has been comprehensive and unitary throughout. This has meant that GGR now considers itself a gay and human rights organisation. [...] "Not only is a position of only fighting one's own corner fundamentally flawed from a human rights perspective,' says Alvarez, 'since human rights are indivisible in and of themselves, the issue of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> is a very real one and noone can convince me, for example, that there are no gay people who are not disabled, nor of different ethnicities or migrant status, nor any other variety of elements. For the simple reason that human beings do not come in neat and exclusive packages: we are diverse. To lose sight of that is to lose sight of the core of what working in human rights is all about!'.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{show how}} the European Community, through {{legislation}} and case law, is addressing the problem of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> and what the possible solutions to it are. <b>Multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> describes a situation where an individual experiences discrimination {{on more than one}} ground. This can occur in two different ways; additive or intersectional. Additive discrimination describes a situation where an individual is discriminated against on more than one ground and these grounds are added on top of each other. Intersectional discrimination explains how an individual’s multiple identities may be the cause of discrimination {{in such a way that}} the grounds for discrimination cannot be considered separately. Expanding the list of grounds in Article 13 EC could help <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> claims but cannot be seen as the exclusive solution to such a complex problem. Many more problems surround <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> claims. One is to find an adequate comparator in order to prove discrimination. Another is that the case law shows a higher rate of success for plaintiffs claiming only one ground of discrimination even if they have experienced <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination,</b> causing a disparity between the facts of the case and the reality experienced by the plaintiffs. In conclusion, such a complex matter cannot be solved by one simple solution but the Community would benefit from an explicit prohibition as well as a common definition of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{has been recognized}} in international law and {{the law of the}} European Union, subse¬quently the gender and anti-discrimination Directives, but it was not clearly defined. Thus effective protection and mechanisms for countering discrimination on multiple grounds such as racial or ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation are lacking across the board. European experiences show that there is the risk of not efficiently covering this type of discrimination with the structure of the existing anti-discrimination legislation. This paper elaborates the position of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the existing anti-discrimination legislation, specifically the European Union law. The paper analyzes the types of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination,</b> such as cumulative or additional discrimination and intersectional discrimination. Furthermore, the paper identifies the key challenges linked with protection of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> cases, such as differences in the substantive and in the personal coverage of the anti-discrimination legislation, differences in the exceptions of specific discriminatory grounds, and difficulties in finding a comparator in cases of indirect <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Finally, the paper presents ways forward in countering <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination,</b> especially the use of Article 14 from the European Convention on Human Rights, which contains an open list of grounds and a general justification, as well as some progressive national legislations such as the Irish Equal Status Act or the German General Act on Equal Treatment.

40|$|A major {{aspect of}} the problem of {{evaluation}} concerns the measurement of educational outcolr [...] . s. Such measurement involves, first of all, an inference regarding what is being learned, retained, or transferred. A description is given of the operations which underlie such inferences. It is contended that educational measurement needs to concern itself with the distinction among a number of classes of learning outcomes, particularly verbal sequences, concepts and principles. Primary criteria in such measurement are considered to be distinctiveness and freedom from distortion. Procedures of laboratory psychologists are described in achieving these criteria in the measurement of such outcomes as conditicned responses, chains and <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminations.</b> Analogous procedures need to be employed in designing items to measure concepts and principles with distinctiveness, and free from distortion. One technique described is two-stage measurement, in which the simpler outcome is measured first, then the more complex. (Author...|$|R
40|$|The present equal {{opportunity}} discourse in Australia, with {{its focus on}} ‘the mainstream woman’, i. e. the white Anglo-Celtic woman, overlooks the multiracial feminist perspectives of ‘the other woman’, the minority ethnic woman. As {{a result of the}} intersection of her sexual, ethnic and/or religious identities, ‘the other woman’ remains dually disadvantaged within Australian society and organizations; largely deprived of the opportunities available to her ‘mainstream’ sister. This paper discusses the complexity of intersections and of how the interaction of systems of stratification constructs specific social locations for minority ethnic women in Australian organizations. The paper draws on critical race and feminist theories with respect to intersectionality of race and gender, and offers quantitative and qualitative data to exemplify issues that surround representation and (in) equality within Australian organizations. The data include an empirical analysis of complaints filed under the federal legislation over a five-year period to determine how minority ethnic women's workplace experiences differ from those of their mainstream counterparts.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> training on vocal pitch-matching and instrumental pitch-matching behaviors, and on the aural music achievement test scores of uncertain singers. Eighty fourth- and fifth-grade students served as the subjects. <b>Multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> training is a paradigm for concept teaching, during which care is taken {{to insure that the}} responses to a concept are controlled by the essential characteristics of the concept rather than by the irrelevant characteristics. The specific <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> training given to two of the four treatment groups consisted of presenting concept instances in the form of five pitches used as criteria in the pretest while varying the irrelevant characteristics of duration, timbre, and intensity.

Results of this study show that <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> training, added to successive approximation techniques, is appropriate as a standard part of training for uncertain singers.

Two experiments {{examined the effects of}} acute pramipexole on rats 2 ̆ 7 impulsive choices where impulsivity was defined as selecting a smaller–sooner over a larger–later food reward. In Experiment 1, pramipexole (0. 1 to 0. 3 mg/kg) significantly increased impulsive choices in a condition in which few impulsive choices were made during a stable baseline. In a control condition, in which impulsive choices predominated during baseline, pramipexole did not significantly change the same rats 2 ̆ 7 choices. Experiment 2 explored a wider range of doses (0. 01 to 0. 3 mg/kg) using a choice procedure in which delays to the larger–later reinforcer delivery increased across trial blocks within each session. At the doses used in Experiment 1, pramipexole shifted choice toward indifference regardless of the operative delay. At lower doses of pramipexole (0. 01 and 0. 03 mg/kg), a trend toward more impulsive choice was observed at the 0. 03 mg/kg dose.

A total of 241 publications included in this scoping review, with 56 from Canada, 74 from the US, 50 from elsewhere in the Global North and 61 from the Global South. LGBTQI people living in the Global South: Homophobic and transphobic violence faced by LGBTQI people living in the Global South is always situated within particular geo-political and regional contexts that are shaped by neo-liberalism, gender inequalities, colonial legacies, nationalisms, armed conflict, police violence, corruption, religious extremism, etc. 	LGBTQI migrants living in Canada: Most focused on LGBTQI refugees. Since 2014 there has been a shift in focus from refugee to precarious status, newcomers and immigrants and exploring how LGBTQI migrants navigated community belonging and structural barriers. LGBTQI migrants living in the US: Exploration of well-being especially with respect to HIV risk and prevention. For LGBTQI migrants, chosen families broke social isolation and fostered belonging. LGBTQI migrants also encounter <b>multiple</b> identity-based <b>discriminations</b> that blocked access to housing and health and social services, along with a fear, especially for those undocumented, of being profiled and detained by immigration officials. 	LGBTQI migrants living elsewhere in the Global North: Two areas of focus include SOGIE-based refugee claims and <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminations</b> by LGBTQI migrants, such as family / community rejection and barriers to access housing, employment, health and social services. Detention centres have a detrimental impact on the mental health of LGBTQI refugees, and increases their exposure to homophobic and transphobic violence. Key research methodologies and theories used: Qualitative research methods used include semi-structured interviews, focus groups, mixed methods and refugee case decisions. Some applied intervention, community-based and/or participatory research methodologies. Theories applied include ecological systems theory, minority stress model, multicultural feminist framework, the social determinants of health and especially intersectionality. Knowledge strengths and gaps: Researcher use of critical and participatory research methodologies as well as intersectionality theory are knowledge strengths. The IRB has implemented SOGIE-based guidelines for decision makers. There remains little knowledge about the realities of LGBTQI immigrants and migrants with precarious status. Need to develop anti-racist, anti-heterosexist and anti-cissexist service delivery and specialized services for LGBTQI migrants. Service providers should engage in trauma-informed and anti-oppressive practice that attends to the intersectional realities of LGBTQI migrants.

40|$|Resumé The {{conception}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{in the legal}} regulation of the European Union To ensure the equality of individuals in society {{is one of the}} most marvelous human ideals. It is generally admitted that the same treatment of people with regard to the acceptance of diversity and between-group differences should be the cornerstone of any modern society. However, is it possible to achieve full equality in society? And what does equality truely mean? Treating everyone in the same way or taking into account the different starting points of individuals? Nowadays we become witnesses that the initial large openness to multiculturalism related to the continuing process of globalization is replaced by a more cautious approach to the different minority groups. As a result, certain groups are exposed to a greater risk of disadvantage mainly due to a combination of different socio-cultural, ethnic, economic and other factors. The aim of my essay is to shed light on the question of equal treatment and non- discrimination law through the relatively new, but in Czech and Central European literature still rarely discussed concept of <b>multiple</b> <b>discrimination.</b> After highlighting the definition of discrimination, the various approaches to equality and other theoretical aspects of discrimination, I am also trying [...] ...|$|E
