40|$|Abstract—A major open {{problem in}} human-robot {{interaction}} remains: how can robots learn from non-technical humans? Such learning {{requires that the}} robot can observe behavior and extract {{the sine qua non}} conditions for when particular actions can be produced. The observed behavior can be either the robots own explorative behavior, or the behavior of humans that it observes. In either case, the only additional information should be from the human, stating whether the observed behavior is legal or not. Such learning may mimic the way that infants learn, through interaction with their caregivers. In the current research we implement a learning capability based on these principals of extracting rules from observed behavior using ”Human-Robot ” interaction or ”Human-Human ” interaction. We test the system using three games: In the first, the robot must copy a pattern formed by the human; in the second the robot must perform the <b>mirror</b> <b>action</b> of the human. In the third game, the robot must learn the legal moves of Tic Tac Toe. Interestingly, while the robot can learn these rules, it does not necessarily learn the rules of strategy, which likely require additional learning mechanisms.

40|$|The Kinetic Tandem {{fusion plasma}} {{confinement}} concept {{is a member}} of the class of open magnetic confinement systems whose magnetic topology is that of a tube of magnetic flux open at both ends. In open-ended systems the central problem is that of limiting the rate of plasma losses out the ends. In a conventional tandem mirror system end-plugging is accomplished by the generation of positive potential barriers within special short mirror cells located at each end of a long central confinement cell. The kinetic tandem concept accomplishes the same end result by employing dynamic effects, but without the necessity of special end cells. The field employed in the kinetic tandem is a simple axially symmetric solenoidal field whose intensity tapers to low values at the ends. Since the field line curvature is everywhere positive such a field is stabilizing for MHD interchange modes. Into each end are injected ion beams that are aimed nearly parallel to the field line direction. The ions from these beams then are radially compressed, stopped, and reflected back by magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>action</b> in climbing up the magnetic gradient. In this way ion density peaks are formed between which the plasma is to be confined. As in the original tandem mirror concept, a localized ambipolar potential arises to maintain quasi-neutrality between the ions and the electrons. provided the plasma density in the plugs is higher than that of the plasma contained between them the ions of the central plasma will be confined between the plugs by the positive potential barriers represented by the plugs. The plasma electrons will at the same time be confined by the overall positive potential of the plasma with respect to the ends. In this report some analytical calculations of the formation of the plugs will be given. These calculations were then confirmed and extended by computer simulations, using the LLNL code ICEPIC. Within the assumptions made in the theoretical calculations and in the code representation, fusion-relevant plug plasma parameters were achieved, and no evidence of unstable behavior was detected in the simulations...|$|E

40|$|SummarySeminal {{studies in}} monkeys {{report that the}} viewing of actions {{performed}} by other individuals activates frontal and parietal cortical areas typically involved in action planning and execution [1 – 3]. That <b>mirroring</b> <b>actions</b> might rely on both motor and somatosensory components is suggested by reports that action observation and execution increase neural activity in motor [4 – 13] and in somatosensory areas [8 – 10, 14 – 17]. This occurs not only during observation of naturalistic movements [4 – 17] but also during the viewing of biomechanically impossible movements that tap the afferent component of action, possibly by eliciting strong somatic feelings in the onlooker [18, 19]. Although somatosensory feedback is inherently linked to action execution [20], information on the possible causative role of frontal and parietal cortices in simulating motor and sensory action components is lacking. By combining low-frequency repetitive and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that virtual lesions of ventral premotor cortex (vPMc) and primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) suppressed mirror motor facilitation contingent upon observation of possible and impossible movements, respectively. In contrast, virtual lesions of primary motor cortex did not influence mirror motor facilitation.

40|$|SummaryThe premotor and parietal mirror neuron system (MNS) {{is thought}} to {{contribute}} to the understanding of observed actions by mapping them onto “corresponding” motor programs of the observer [1 – 24], but how would the MNS respond to the observation of hand actions if the observer never had hands? Would it not show changes of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal, because the observer lacks motor programs that can resonate [12, 25, 26], or would it show significant changes because the observer has motor programs for the foot or mouth with corresponding goals [15, 17, 19, 27, 28]? We scanned two aplasic subjects, born without arms or hands, while they watched hand actions and compared their brain activity with that of 16 control subjects. All subjects additionally executed actions with different effectors (feet, mouth, and, for controls, hands). The BOLD signal of aplasic individuals within the putative MNS was augmented when they watched hand actions, demonstrating the brain's capacity to <b>mirror</b> <b>actions</b> that deviate from the embodiment of the observer by recruiting voxels involved in the execution of actions that achieve corresponding goals by different effectors.
