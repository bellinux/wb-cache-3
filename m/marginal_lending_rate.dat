40|$|The authors {{suggest that}} the credit channel - as a {{transmitter}} of monetary and financial shocks - appears to have aggravated the Republic of Korea's economic crisis. They use micro-data gathered at the bank level to better identify this channel of transmission. They find that: 1) Monetary tightening broadens the spread between <b>marginal</b> bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and corporate commercial paper rates (consistent with hypothesis that bank lending is a transmitter of monetary shocks). 2) Credit limits on overdrafts - arguably a proxy to identify shifts in the loan supply - react negatively to the monetary squeeze. 3) After the stiffening of bank capital adequacy requirements, banks suffering from larger negative capital shocks experience a more marked slowdown in lending and deposit-taking and also raise their loan rates disproportionately. These findings {{lend support to the}} hypothesis that autonomous contraction by banks restricts the availability of credit and magnifies the increase in its cost. This phenomenon compounded the Korean crisis by aggravating liquidity constraints for most agents that rely on bank credit as their only external source of funds. Policymakers may want to provide relief - possibly through market-based actions - to the small and medium-sized enterprises (and other businesses) that suffer unduly from such a credit crunch. To reduce obstacles to recovery, they may also want to devise market-based incentives to make bank loans available to healthy firms in sectors (such as exports) on which recovery depends.

40|$|The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) {{changed its}} {{accommodation}} procedures from using a discount window to a repurchase (or repo) accommodation system during March 1998. The previous system guaranteed full accommodation of liquidity needs to banks, while the repo system aim to control liquidity {{with the use}} of a penalty rate (the <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate)</b> when liquidity in excess of the amount offered by the Reserve Bank is required. At first the <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> was fixed at 1 per cent above the repo rate, but during June 1998 the <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> increased to 20 per cent above repo. Small banks (which accommodate via large banks) are more exposed to this <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> in times of limited liquidity, than large South African banks. They also have less access to purchased funds. In order to address the small banks â€™ problem of paying excessively high rates during times of limited liquidity, securitisation of assets and mortgages are investigated. Although widely used in other parts of the world, only limited securitisation deals have been conducted in South Africa and the market for securitised instruments is relatively undeveloped. This paper aims to (i) determine the suitability of securitisation as a source of liquidity for small South African banks; (ii) shed light on the difficulties experienced in securitising products in South Africa, and (iii) make recommendations to improve the South African market for securitised products...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, I study whether {{structural}} bank characteristics {{can help to}} explain a bank's propensity to take recourse to the ECB's marginal lending facility (MLF). My key finding is that besides structural measures capturing a bank's business model, indicators for its liquidity risk management have a highly significant predictive power for a bank's access to the lender-of-the-last-resort (LLR) facility. A bank with volatile reserve holdings, a lower average reserve fulfillment and a more aggressive bidding behavior in the main refinancing operations, is {{significantly more likely to}} revert to the MLF. These results suggest that the option value of having access to the ECB's LLR varies significantly across banks. Thus (i) a uniform <b>Marginal</b> <b>Lending</b> <b>rate</b> undermines market efficiency and (ii) structural bank characteristics could be used to adequately adjust the pricing of the MLF to bank specific structural liquidity risks...|$|E

Our main findings are: (1) pass-through from the money market <b>rate</b> to <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is not complete (2) the speed of adjustment varies quite considerably across alternative <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and (3) there has been significant structural change in the relationship between the money market <b>rate</b> and <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> both in terms of pass-through and speed of adjustment during this period. ...|$|R

The key components of the KBRR; The 91 day T-Bill rate and the Central Bank Rate were the main focus of this study along with the inter-bank <b>lending</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper used an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model to estimate the short run and long run impact of the 91 day Tbill Rate, Central Bank <b>Rate</b> and Inter-bank <b>Lending</b> <b>Rate</b> on the average commercial bank <b>lending</b> <b>rate.</b> Time series data from the Central Bank of Kenya was used for the period July 1991 -May 2015.

The responsiveness of these <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is nonlinearly related to corruption and government control of the banking sector.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and their cost of funds in New Zealand. Our results show that on average mortgage rates respond more quickly {{to changes in the}} cost of funds than base business <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> We also find an asymmetry in the initial (short-run) response of banks to changes in funding costs; in particular, our results show banks adjust mortgage rates downwards faster than upwards. The speed to which <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> revert back to their equilibrium relationship with funding costs varies across the lending markets. We find the adjustment speed is faster when mortgage rates are below equilibrium, whereas it is slower when business <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> are above long-run levels in relation to funding costs. Our analysis suggests that banks prefer the plain-vanilla type of lending such as mortgages in comparison to small business lending consistent with asymmetric information associated with business loans. <b>Lending</b> <b>rate</b> Cost of funds Small and medium enterprises Information asymmetry Error-correction models...|$|R

The exchange rate turns out significant only for the specification of <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and personal consumption, suggesting that these increase in response to depreciation. Finally, we find some evidence of lower <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> owing to heightened advanced economiesâ€™ volatility risk, proxied by the VIX.

40|$|The {{stickiness}} of bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> {{with respect}} to money market rates is often regarded {{as an obstacle to}} the smooth transmission of monetary policy impulses. Yet, no systematic measure of the different degree of <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> stickiness across countries has been attempted. This paper provides such a measure. It also relates the different degree of <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> stickiness to structural features of the financial system, such as the existence of barriers to competition, the degree of development of financial markets, and the ownership structure of the banking system. Thus, the paper provides further evidence on the relationship between structural financial policies and monetary policy, {{as well as on the}} relevance of credit markets for the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

High monitoring costs magnify the size of crises and restrict the generation of information that fuels recoveries. Finally, by calibrating the model, I show that cross-country differences in the asymmetry of <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations are well explained by differences in these financial frictions. ...|$|R
