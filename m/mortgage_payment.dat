500|$|The {{median value}} of a housing unit in the US was $167,500 in 2005 with the median <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> being clocked at $1,295. The average size of a {{household}} was 2.5 persons with almost all housing units, 97%, having 1 or fewer occupants per room. However, the term [...] "room" [...] does not exclusively refer to bedrooms, but includes the kitchen, dining room, family room, bath rooms and any other rooms a house might have. While 85% of American homes had 3 or fewer bedrooms the median number of total rooms per housing units was 5.3 in 2005. Considering these statistics one can conclude that the average American resides {{in his or her}} own home, pays roughly $1,000 per month in mortgage payments for a three or less bedroom house with no more than one occupant per room.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, Brundage and {{his company}} became very active in {{constructing}} high-rise apartment buildings in Chicago. He used rapid construction methods, allowing clients to begin realizing income from their investments quickly—the Sheridan-Brompton Apartments (1924) overlooking Lincoln Park, were built in five months, allowing the start of $40,000 in monthly rental income, offsetting a monthly <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> of $15,000. Often, the Brundage Company {{was involved in the}} ownership of the apartments: 3800 Sheridan Road (1927), a 17-story building costing $3,180,000, was owned by a company which had as its president and treasurer Chester Brundage, Avery's younger brother. It was constructed in eight months, through the Chicago winter, using an onsite concrete mixing plant. This temporary structure also provided office space for the construction. Another source of income for Brundage {{and his company}} was hotel construction, for which he was often paid in part with stock in the new facility. One president of an engineering firm specializing in large structures called Brundage's methods on the Shoreham Hotel [...] "progressive, snappy, [...] up-to-date" [...] and [...] "straightforward and honest".|$|E
500|$|Between 1998 and 2000, Sevigny {{moved back}} to Connecticut {{to live with her}} mother, and {{appeared}} as a lesbian in the Emmy Award-winning television movie If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000), the sequel to the HBO television drama-film If These Walls Could Talk (1996). Sevigny reportedly took the role in the film in order to help pay her mother's <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment,</b> and has credited it as the only film she ever made for financial benefit. Following this appearance, Sevigny was approached for a supporting role in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde alongside Reese Witherspoon and offered $500,000; she declined and the role was given to Selma Blair. Instead, she starred in Olivier Assayas' French techno thriller Demonlover (2002) alongside Connie Nielsen, for which she was required to learn her lines in French. Sevigny described shooting the film as [...] "strange", in the sense that director Assayas hardly spoke to her during the filming, which she said was difficult {{because of the lack of}} [...] "input". After spending nearly three months in France to complete Demonlover, Sevigny returned to New York to film the Club Kids biopic, Party Monster (2003); coincidentally, Sevigny in fact knew several of the people depicted in the film (Michael Alig and James St. James included), whom she had met during her frequent trips to New York City's club scene as a teenager.|$|E

2500|$|For {{those who}} only want a rough {{idea of the}} <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> there is a much less intimidating {{approximate}} formula [...] here. For the numbers given above we simply compute an approximate annual repayment of 200,000*(1/n [...] + [...] (2/3)*i) where n=10 yrs, i=0.06. So 200,000*(1/10 + (2/3)*0.06) = 200,000*(0.1+0.04) = 200,000*0.14 = $28,000 per year, roughly, via mental arithmetic alone. [...] Note, as this is an approximation we may ignore the subtleties of monthly compounding. [...] Now $28,000 per year is about 28,000/12 = $2,333 per month, which approximates the true answer to within about 5% but has required only mental arithmetic.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} {{property}} ownership on the saving behaviour of households. We are particularly interested in investigating whether homeowners save more than renters or not. A related question is whether <b>mortgage</b> <b>payments</b> and other regular savings are substitutes or complements for German households. To answer these questions we use a large cross-sectional dataset on individual households’ finances and employ a matching estimator. We find that households owning property and repaying mortgages do save more than renters, if contractual savings and <b>mortgage</b> <b>payments</b> are summed up. However, the difference between regular savings flows of renters and owners is small and insignificant.

50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan and a traditional <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan is that instead of making 12 full payments each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one half traditional payments. Finance companies use this pattern to their advantage. Finance companies charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the finance companies to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional accrued interest charges.|$|E
