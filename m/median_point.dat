Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested <b>median</b> <b>point</b> of 3,500, which includes more than 1,000 captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of whom died on Orient. In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships {{of the line and}} two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew), and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary hemiarthroplasty of the {{shoulder}} is used to treat complex proximal humeral fractures, although the reported functional results following this method of treatment have varied widely. The {{aim of this study}} was to pro-spectively assess the prosthetic survival and functional outcomes in a large series of patients treated with shoulder hemiarthroplasty for a proximal humeral fracture. By determining the factors that affected the outcome, we also aimed to produce models that could be used clinically to estimate the functional outcome at one year following surgery. Methods: A thirteen-year observational cohort study of 163 consecutive patients treated with hemiarthroplasty for a proximal humeral fracture was performed. Twenty-five patients died or were lost to follow-up in the first year after treatment, leaving 138 patients who had assessment of shoulder function with use of the modified Constant score at one year postinjury. Results: The overall rate of prosthetic survival was 96. 9 % at one year, 95. 3 % at five years, and 93. 9 % at ten years. The overall median modified Constant score was 64 points at one year, with a typically good score for pain relief (me-dian, 15 points) and poorer scores, with a greater scatter of values, for function (<b>median,</b> 12 <b>points),</b> range of motion (<b>median,</b> 24 <b>points),</b> and muscle power (<b>median,</b> 14 <b>points).</b> Of the factors that were assessed immediately after th...|$|R
