5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> to ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

However, in an unusual move, the {{character}} of Poirot was replaced with Christie's other most famous detective Miss Marple (portrayed by Margaret Rutherford), who comes onto the case when she is a juror {{in the trial of}} the lodger who is accused of the murder. As she is the only juror to believe the lodger is innocent and will not join with the others to vote guilty the jury foreman says to the judge that they cannot <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> The judge rules for a mistrial and arranges for a retrial for a week's time, giving Miss Marple seven days to solve the case.|$|E
25|$|Voting in most Irish {{constituencies}} {{occurred on}} 14 December 1918. While {{the rest of}} the United Kingdom fought the 'Khaki election' on other issues involving the British parties, in Ireland four major political parties had national appeal. These were the IPP, Sinn Féin, the Irish Unionist Party and the Irish Labour Party. The Labour Party, however, decided not to participate in the election, fearing that it would be caught in the political crossfire between the IPP and Sinn Féin; it thought it better to let the people <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> on the issue of Home Rule versus a Republic by having a clear two-way choice between the two nationalist parties. The Unionist Party favoured continuance of the union with Britain (along with its subordinate, the Ulster Unionist Labour Association, who fought as 'Labour Unionists'). A number of other small nationalist parties also took part.|$|E

25|$|Worth {{returned}} to Florida {{at the beginning}} of November 1842. He soon decided that Tiger Tail and Otiarche had taken too long to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> on what to do, and ordered that they be brought in. Tiger Tail was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter, and he died in New Orleans waiting for transportation to the Indian territory. The other Indians in northern Florida were also captured and sent west. By April 1843 only one regiment, the Eighth Infantry, was still in Florida. In November 1843 Worth reported that the only Indians left in Florida were 42 Seminole warriors, 33 Mikasukis, 10 Creeks and 10 Tallahassees, with women and children bringing the total to about 300. Worth also stated that these Indians were all living on the reservation and were no longer a threat to the white population of Florida.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 November, the {{reinforcements}} and the loyal members of the 26th and 62nd Regiments moved into position. They secretly surrounded the sepoy camp ground and a final message {{was sent to the}} mutineers, demanding that they lay down arms before any discussion on grievances but it is said that only ten minutes were offered to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> The sepoys either hesitated or rejected the ultimatum and Paget ordered two cannons to fire on the rebels, followed by an attack from the rear by the secretly placed horse artillery. Surprised by this sudden assault, the sepoys tried to flee {{but the rest of the}} British regiments attacked from all directions. Some of the sepoys jumped into the Hooghly River to escape and drowned, others entered local households for shelter but the loyalists chased them in and killed them with bayonets. Many bystanders, including women and children who happened to be in the neighbourhood, were killed during the operation. Afterwards, it was found that the muskets of the Indian sepoys were not loaded. Stevenson concludes that this implies no violence was intended by the rebels.|$|E

Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> As the New Age concept became popular in the U.S. in the late 1990s, Madonna tried to shun the [...] "material girl" [...] tag, and embarked on a spiritual quest of her own.

500|$|On Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{transitions}} seamlessly into {{a second}} track entitled [...] "Reign of Love". In an interview with Q magazine, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band could not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about the track listing, as they had discussed {{that they wanted to}} keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks and an intended length of under 42 minutes. Champion further stated, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen to it all in one go."

500|$|Elements of {{the book}} were rewritten while several songs {{underwent}} minor transformations. This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us. We learned a lot from the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> before they come to the theatre." [...] On October 30, 2003, the musical opened on Broadway.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably never have done so. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl? The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide.

500|$|Darryl {{thinks his}} {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} why [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] had an {{additional}} track, bassist Guy Berryman {{explained that the}} band couldn't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> because they had discussed {{that they did not}} want an extra song on the album, and instead they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks (and an intended length of under 42 minutes).

He added that the reason for having two titles in the track listing of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was due to American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake doing it for his last album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).|$|E
2500|$|However, the Garda Representative Association {{remained}} unapologetic {{noting that}} while Mr. Justice Barr had {{four years to}} compile his report, officers at the scene had only seconds to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Symbolically, six weeks before the report was first due, the chief negotiator on the day, Detective Inspector Michael Jackson, was recommended by Garda management for promotion {{to the rank of}} superintendent. The Gardaí had been reluctant to give an apology with the Garda Commissioner Noel Conroy omitting an apology from a statement issued on 21 July 2006: [...] "The outcome of the siege at Abbeylara, which resulted in the death of John Carthy is very much regretted. As previously expressed at both the tribunal and the inquest, the sympathies of all members of An Garda Síochána are offered to Mrs Rose Carthy and the extended Carthy family". At a subsequent press conference, John Carthy's sister, Marie, lambasted the Garda refusal to give an apology saying that it was regrettable that the Gardaí was still not accepting responsibility for her brother's death. Finally, on 10 August 2006, the Garda Síochána issued an apology to the Carthy family. They were, the statement said, [...] "truly apologetic for the loss of John's life".|$|E

2500|$|The Camp Matthews {{site for}} the University was {{selected}} with some hesitation; {{one of the concerns}} was [...] "whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst". La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure European ancestry could own property; this excluded Jews, who were not considered white. Such [...] "restrictive covenants" [...] were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968). However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there. Revelle stated the issue bluntly: [...] "You can't have a university without having Jewish professors. The Real Estate Broker's Association and their supporters in La Jolla had to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> whether they wanted a university or an anti-Semitic covenant. You couldn't have both." [...] The issue was overcome; La Jolla now boasts a thriving Jewish population, and there are four synagogues in La Jolla.|$|E
