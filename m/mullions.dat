5|$|The cloisters {{were built}} in the late 13th century and largely rebuilt from 1430 to 1508 and have wide {{openings}} divided by <b>mullions</b> and transoms, and tracery in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The vault has lierne ribs that form octagons at the centre of each compartment, the joints of each rib having decorative bosses. The eastern range is of two storeys, of which the upper is the library built in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by <b>mullions),</b> save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|When Wright left Raymond {{set up his}} own office, he advertised {{himself as}} a {{specialist}} in reinforced concrete. He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert, its structural ones from Wright, and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing. His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School, {{which was one of}} the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo. Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative elements for the building, such as window <b>mullions.</b> In a partially successful experiment, he used wooden formwork to imprint a texture onto the concrete (but he chose to cover it up).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mullion</b> {{civil parish}} {{encompasses}} the church town (now {{known simply as}} <b>Mullion)</b> and four smaller settlements: <b>Mullion</b> Cove and Predannack to the southwest; Trewoon and Meaver to the east. <b>Mullion</b> is bordered by the parishes of Gunwalloe and Cury to the north, Grade-Ruan to the east, Landewednack to the south, and by Mount's Bay to the west.

5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting <b>mullions</b> and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
5|$|St Mary Redcliffe is {{cruciform}} in plan, with {{a chapel}} extending {{to the east}} of the chancel, and a large 13th-century tower placed asymmetrically {{to the north of the}} west front. The tower was added to the building in the 13th century. It has broad angle buttresses and Y tracery to the windows. The bell stage has ogee gables and polygonal corner pinnacles. After the collapse of the original spire in 1446 it remained truncated until the 1870s when George Godwin rebuilt it. The nave, chancel and choir are vaulted with richly decorated with bosses in a variety of styles. The Lady Chapel has a star vault. The transepts has large pointed spandrels and a blind arcade with <b>mullions</b> descending from the clerestory windows. Beneath the Lady Chapel is a small crypt, with a larger one beneath the transept of three by two bays.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The doorway to the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered <b>mullions.</b> The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E
40|$|In French-style doors a flipper <b>mullion</b> is {{provided}} {{to have an}} air tight seal to avoid heat leakage between the doors. It is attached {{to one of the}} French doors through both of the hinge members. However, due to the complexity of the current concept, the outside surface of the flipper <b>mullion</b> remains in a cold temperature, presenting moisture. The moisture is unacceptable for aesthetic and safety reasons. A usual solution is to use a heater inside the flipper <b>mullion</b> (7 to 10 W). The heater increases the temperature of the outside surface, avoiding the moisture formation. It increases the complexity of the assembly and the energy consumption. A 7 W flipper <b>mullion</b> heater power corresponds to 5 kWh/ month, which means around 4 % of the total energy consumption of regular French door refrigerators. In the present study, an attempt has been made to reduce the external condensation by changing the material and the design of flipper <b>mullion.</b> Variation of flipper <b>mullion</b> external surface temperature with change in the material and design of flipper <b>mullion</b> are investigated to determine the economically viable concept...|$|R

5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone <b>mullions).</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{windows on the}} south side of the nave; the one to the west of the porch is set in a pointed frame, and the others are in square frames. The middle and easternmost of the five date {{originally}} from the 15th century but have been repositioned; the other three are 19th-century. On the north side, there is a pointed doorway from the early 14th century, with a 19th-century window to the west and two repositioned 15th-century windows with two lights (sections of window separated by <b>mullions)</b> to the east. The west wall has a repositioned 15th-century window. The chancel's east window is also 15th-century, with three lights headed by trefoils (a three-leaf pattern) and decorated with tracery. It has 19th-century glass depicting the Ascension. The south side of the chancel and the north transept have 19th-century windows; the south chancel window has three lights with tracery headed by cinquefoils (a five-leaf pattern), with geometric patterns of glass.|$|E
5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, <b>mullions,</b> and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E
