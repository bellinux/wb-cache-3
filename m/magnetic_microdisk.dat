40|$|The {{effect of}} the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya {{interaction}} on the vortex in <b>magnetic</b> <b>microdisk</b> was investigated by micro magnetic simulation based on the Landau Lifshitz Gilbert equation. Our {{results show that the}} DM interaction modifies the size of the vortex core, and also induces an out of plane magnetization component at the edge and inside the disk. The DM interaction can destabilizes one vortex handedness, generate a bias field to the vortex core and couple the vortex polarity and chirality. This DM-interaction-induced coupling can therefore provide a new way to control vortex polarity and chirality...|$|E
40|$|The topological {{nature of}} magnetic-vortex state {{gives rise to}} {{peculiar}} magnetization reversal observed in <b>magnetic</b> <b>microdisks.</b> Interestingly, magnetostatic and exchange energies which drive this reversal can be effectively controlled in artificial ferrimagnet heterostructures composed of rare-earth and transition metals. 25 x[Py(t) /Gd(t) ] (t= 1 or 2 nm) superlattices demonstrate a pronounced change of the magnetization and exchange stiffness in a 10 - 300 K temperature range as well as very small magnetic anisotropy. Due to these properties, the magnetization of cylindrical microdisks composed of these artificial ferrimagnets can be transformed from the vortex to uniformly-magnetized states in a permanent magnetic field by changing the temperature. We explored the behavior of magnetization in 1. 5 -micrometer 25 x[Py(t) /Gd(t) ] (t= 1 or 2 nm) disks at different temperatures and magnetic fields and observed that due to the energy barrier separating vortex and uniformly-magnetized states, the vortex nucleation and annihilation occur at different temperatures. This causes the temperature dependences of the Py/Gd disks magnetization to demonstrate unique hysteretic behavior in a narrow temperature range. It was discovered that for the 25 x[Py(2 nm) /Gd(2 nm) ] microdisks the vortex can be metastable at a certain temperature range...|$|R
