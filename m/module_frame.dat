40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} idea of {{projective}} multiresolution analyses and extends it to modules over noncommutative C*-algebras, particularly irrational rotation algebras, by constructing a concrete examples. We provide background information on irrational rotation algebras, Hilbert C*-modules, and Morita equivalence of C*-algebras. We then discuss previous definitions due to J. Packer and M. Rieffel, and modify these definitions to account for our specific situation. Then our first example of a projective multiresolution analysis over Aα is built, using {{the framework of a}} Morita equivalence due to M. Rieffel and employing a scaling function due to I. Daubechies. We then use our new PMRA to construct a <b>module</b> <b>frame</b> for a Hilbert module over an irrational rotation algebra, and using the <b>module</b> <b>frame</b> create an explicit isomorphism to a well-known Hilbert module. We create more examples of projective multiresolution analyses over irrational rotation algebras by generalizing our construction of the initial example. We examine direct sums of PMRAs, and then show that a PMRA can be combined with a compatible Morita equivalence structure to create a new projective multiresolution analysis. This construction relies heavily on the use of balanced tensor products, and is employed to create new examples of PMRAs involving Morita equivalences due to M. Rieffel and F. Luef...|$|E

40|$|Transformerless {{inverters}} {{technology in}} photovoltaic systems offers many advantages, {{but there are}} some safety issues due to the solar panel parasitic capacitance. The parasitic capacitance value depends on many factors such as PV panels and frame structure, surface of the cells, distance between the cells, <b>module</b> <b>frame,</b> weather conditions (e. g., humidity) and the amount of dust covering the PV panel. Harsh climate like the one in the Central Queensland region is characterized by high temperature, high relative humidity. Due to the region’s high dew point, high humidity and heavy rain during the wet season, the water condensed over the PV array surface will affect the stray capacitance significantly and consequently, the system leakage current. Human safety in PV system is a key issue, which must be addressed when this technology is applied. Protection against electrical shock is essential while deploying such systems to avoid injury or loss of life. Furthermore, PV insulation varies with meteorological conditions such as, temperatures, humidity. Therefore, the protective circuit should have the capability to adapt to any changes in metrological variables.

30|$|PHY {{package is}} a program {{collection}} {{which is responsible for}} the physical layer functions corresponding to the real world, the main capability is using the frame structure form to provide link capacity, and the modular function includes the various wireless technical frame structures, such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), and subcarrier permutation mechanism. There are three main modules in this package, i.e., slot factory <b>module,</b> <b>frame</b> builder module, and resource allocation module. In slot factory module, factory pattern is used to produce the simple structure object, such as basic slot structure, slot, and frame, because these objects use only one substructure type. In frame builder module, builder pattern is used to produce more complex objects, such as subframe, because the area types and amount {{on the inside of the}} subframe are dependent on the network topology and the device node-type. In resource allocation module, the order of nodes to obtain link resource is in first-come first-served (FCFS) manner. The system architecture will be implemented by the use of singleton if the real object only has one object entity to exist, such as subcarrier permutation mode or basic slot structure. Meanwhile, in order to simplify the needed parameters of frame production, we enumerate the original parameters in advance, such as system bandwidth and fast Fourier transform (FFT) sizes, and then, we calculate the derived parameters by using the original parameters, such as symbol time, useful transmission time, and the amount of symbol time of frame. According to the selected parameters, such as the ratio of bandwidth allocation and permutation mode for DL and UL, user can calculate the duration and sub-channel amount of subframe finally to create the instance of frame object. There exist three conditions to have the best solution of the subframe duration allocation, i.e., to completely use the frame duration, to exactly be the integer multiple of slot time for the subframe duration, and to be identical for both the subframe duration ratio and the bandwidth allocation ratio; therefore, we proposed a two-stage minimum variance bandwidth allocation algorithm (TSMVBA) to deal with the bandwidth allocation problem for DL and UL subframes. The UML diagrams for slot factory and frame factory have been shown in Appendix  1 : Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.|$|E
