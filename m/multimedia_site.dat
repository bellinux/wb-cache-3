The project received over 100,000 donors from around the world.|$|E

Efficient search of large collections of multimedia requires metadata that is human-meaningful, but currently <b>multimedia</b> <b>sites</b> generally utilize metadata derived from user-entered tags and descriptions.

40|$|Social {{multimedia}} hosting {{and sharing}} websites, such as Flickr, Facebook, Youtube, Picasa, ImageShack and Photobucket, are increasingly popular around the globe. A major {{trend in the}} current studies on social multimedia is using the social media sites {{as a source of}} huge amount of labeled data for solving large scale computer science problems in computer vision, data mining and multimedia. In this paper, we take a new path to explore the global trends and sentiments that can be drawn by analyzing the sharing patterns of uploaded and downloaded social multimedia. In a sense, each time an image or video is uploaded or viewed, it constitutes an implicit vote for (or against) the subject of the image. This vote carries along with it a rich set of associated data including time and (often) location information. By aggregating such votes across millions of Internet users, we reveal the wisdom that is embedded in social <b>multimedia</b> <b>sites</b> for social science applications such as politics, economics, and marketing. We believe that our work opens a brand new arena for the multimedia research community with a potentially big impact on society and social sciences...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedNetwork Behavior Analysis (NBA) {{is a technique}} to enhance network security by passively monitoring aggregate traffic patterns and noting unusual action or departures from normal operations. The analysis is typically performed offline, due to the huge volume of input data, in contrast to conventional intrusion prevention solutions based on deep packet inspection, signature detection, and real-time blocking. After establishing a benchmark for normal traffic, an NBA program monitors network activity and flags unknown, new, or unusual patterns that might indicate {{the presence of a}} potential threat. NBA also monitors and records trends in bandwidth and protocol use. Computer users in the Department of Defense (DoD) operational networks may use Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) to stream video from <b>multimedia</b> <b>sites</b> like youtube. com, myspace. com, mtv. com, and blackplanet. com. Such streaming may hog bandwidth, a grave concern, given that increasing amounts of operational data are exchanged over the Global Information Grid, and introduce malicious viruses inadvertently. This thesis develops an NBA solution to identify and estimate the bandwidth usage of HTTP streaming video traffic entirely from flow records such as Cisco's NetFlow data. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how social media and Internet {{resources}} are helping nonprofit organizations (NPOs) work to achieve their mission. Throughout the paper, three environmental nonprofits—West Michigan Environmental Action Council, Energy Action Coalition, and Greenpeace—serve as a microcosm for how Social Media is currently being used by environmental NPOs. This paper is focused on several different types of social media sites, including social networking sites, blogging <b>sites,</b> and <b>multimedia</b> <b>sites.</b> Examples are given of how these sites have been successful, and how they have been less successful than originally hoped. The effectiveness and usefulness of Internet resources and mobile giving to NPOs is also analyzed. I identify the barriers to effectively using these tools, and the shortcomings and problems caused by utilizing social media. This study includes a survey of college-aged Americans, who share their experiences regarding the nonprofits they follow through Social Media. These surveys provided insight into what approaches NPOs are using, and how effective these approaches have been. Finally, I give recommendations on how these NPOs can more effectively use Social Media, and warn the reader against over-reliance on Internet tools...|$|R
