25|$|Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or {{with normal}} ears, are {{typically}} good-natured and placid and adjust to other animals within a household extremely well. They {{tend to become}} very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and intelligence. These animals like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and activities very much. Loneliness is something they heavily dislike and which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> depressed. It is also common for Scottish Folds to be stubborn.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> glamorous and special.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or they have used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{cyclical}} {{lighting is}} used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include {{but are not limited}} to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.|$|E

500|$|Church women {{personalize}} their attire, {{according to}} Patricia Fortuny. [...] Rebozos are worn by indigenous members and specially designed veils by other female members. Fortuny says that, [...] "...wearing long skirts does not negate {{the meaning of}} being a woman and, although it underlines the difference between men and women, [...] say {{that it does not}} make them feel like inferior human beings". Fortuny says women describe their attire as part of obeying biblical commands found in 1 Timothy 2:9, and 1 Corinthians 11:15 for long hair. Female members say the Church's dress code <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> they are honoring God and that it is part of their [...] "essence".|$|E
500|$|The song {{is carried}} by an [...] "anthemic" [...] {{sound and the}} [...] "riveting vocals" [...] of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where {{are the people that}} accused me?" [...] Richardson said, [...] "The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed for accusing her ...

2500|$|European-style dominoes are {{traditionally}} made of bone or ivory, or a dark hardwood such as ebony, with contrasting {{black or white}} pips (inlaid or painted). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., marble, granite or soapstone); other hardwoods (e.g., ash, oak, redwood, and cedar); metals (e.g., brass or pewter); ceramic clay, or even frosted glass or crystal. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more substantial; also, such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials.|$|E
2500|$|However, recent surveys suggest there is, on the contrary, a {{resurgence}} of home music making.

Joe Lamond, president of the National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) attributes the increase to a growth of home music-making by adults approaching retirement. [...] "I would really look to the demographics of the [...] boomers", he said in an interview. These people [...] "are starting to look for something that matters to them... nothing <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> good more than playing music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opium {{is said to}} {{have been}} used for {{recreational}} purposes from the 14th century onwards in Muslim societies. Ottoman and European testimonies confirm that from the 16th to the 19th centuries Anatolian opium was eaten in Constantinople as much as it was exported to Europe. In 1573, for instance, a Venetian visitor to the Ottoman Empire observed many of the Turkish natives of Constantinople regularly drank a [...] "certain black water made with opium" [...] that <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> good, but to which they become so addicted, if they try to go without, they will [...] "quickly die". From drinking it, dervishes claimed the drugs bestowed them with visionary glimpses of future happiness. Indeed, Turkey supplied the West with opium long before China and India.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they do is not enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> incompetent. They may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E
2500|$|Trolling is a {{prominent}} {{issue in the}} 2010s, an as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is Stephen Fry. He left Twitter due to [...] "too much aggression and unkindness around" [...] emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014). As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less {{in touch with their}} fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.|$|E
2500|$|Interviews with {{strippers}} {{have revealed}} that the customers are generally viewed as [...] "suckers" [...] for giving the dancers money just for their physical attraction. Dancers, {{in an attempt to}} acquire a tip or monetary reward, may be selling more than just attractiveness and fantasy. [...] They portray feelings of intimacy and emotional connectedness for their customers {{and most of the time}} these portrayals are overstated or false. The stage persona is different from who they are backstage, even if it does mirror aspects of their true personality. Within the context of the strip club, dancers might sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private (or backstage) information to customers in order to play a confidence game for increased profit. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their [...] "front" [...] while in the club. Customers rarely, if ever, see the preparation of these props, since they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance space by the layout of the club. A customer often wants a dancer to [...] "drop the act", which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> special and desired. This girlfriend experience can involve increased intimacy up to and including sex acts. Dancers are commonly aware of this customer desire for increased confidence, and may allow the impression that a customer is seeing their true selves. In reality, it is often just part of the act with little to no emotional attachment for the dancer.|$|E
