5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes {{infected}} with T. cruzi by feeding {{on the blood}} of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> for Chagas disease, but {{the development and}} implementation of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV is through {{sexual contact with}} an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

25|$|Output power limits {{may also}} {{depend on the}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> In Australia, for example, 400W {{may be used for}} SSB transmissions, but FM and other modes are limited to 120W.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} aspect of the biology of beneficial microbial symbionts, such as coral-associated dinoflagellates or human microbiota. Organisms can form symbioses with microbes transmitted from their parents, from the environment or unrelated individuals, or both.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{transmission}} {{requires a}} period of incubation of the trypanosomes within the tsetse host. The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host {{during the period of}} incubation, which requires extreme adaptation of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.|$|E

50|$|By having {{multiple}} <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> {{this ensures}} {{the persistence of}} R. rickettsii in a population. Also, by having multiple <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> this helps the disease adapt better to new environments and prevents it from becoming eradicated. R. rickettsii has evolved a number of strategical mechanisms or virulence factors {{that allow them to}} invade the host immune system and successfully infect the host.|$|R
25|$|After {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of the ‘viral concept’ there was need to classify any other known viral diseases based on the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> even though microscopic observation proved fruitless. In 1939 Holmes published a classification list of 129 plant viruses. This was expanded and in 1999 there were 977 officially recognized, and some provisional, plant virus species.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|E
25|$|Other manga {{works in}} Algeria employ a similar strategy: authors attempt {{to expand the}} {{resonance}} of their works by appealing to established tropes within Algerian culture. Fella Matougui's and Salim Brahimi's shōjo manga Nahla et les Touareg (2010), for example, uses the openness of the manga format to present Tuareg culture.

25|$|In one {{outbreak}} at {{an international}} scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place.

A US CDC study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools and ice machines.|$|E
25|$|Having {{a female}} partner {{increases}} the risk of BV by 60%. The bacteria associated with BV have been isolated from male genitalia. BV microbiota has been found in the penis, coronal sulcus, and male urethra, in the male partners of infected females. Partners who have not been circumcised may act as a ‘reservoir’ increasing the likelihood of acquiring an infection after sexual intercourse. Another <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of the BV-associated microbiota is to a female sexual partner via skin-to-skin transfer. BV may be transmitted via the perineal enteric bacteria from the microbiota of the female and male genitalia.|$|E
25|$|S. schenckii has a {{worldwide}} distribution but {{certain areas of}} the world including Peru, have a higher incidence of disease. Based on sequence analysis it has been found that S. schenckii isolates can be placed in phylogenetic groups that reflect the region from which they were isolated. S. schenckii is often isolated from plants and associated packing material. Gardeners, landscapers, and foresters are at high risk of infection. Sporothrix infection can also be transmitted by cat bites or scratches. This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> has been responsible for epidemics of sporotrichosis. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of infection and such patients often exhibit more severe forms of disease.|$|E

A study in the Netherlands found no XMRV in the semen of HIV-positive men. Both cell-associated and cell-free transmission have been reported in vitro. XMRV is closely related to several known xenotropic mouse viruses. These viruses recognize and enter cells of non-rodent species by means of the cell-surface xenotropic and polytropic murine leukemia virus receptor (XPR1).|$|R

25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} use various <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to communicate. The {{two most}} common modes for voice transmissions are frequency modulation (FM) and single sideband (SSB).

25|$|Whether {{found in}} {{temperate}} countries like France or tropical ones like Ivory Coast, aquatic bugs exhibit {{the same way}} of life, preying, according to their size, on mollusks, snails, young fish, and the adults and larvae of other insects that they capture with their raptorial front legs and bite with their rostrum. These insects can inflict painful bites on humans as well. In the Ivory Coast, where Buruli ulcer is endemic, the water bugs are present in swamps and rivers, where human activities such as farming, fishing, and bathing take place. Present findings describing the experimental transmission of M. ulcerans from water bugs to mice are in good agreement {{with the possibility of}} this <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to humans by bites.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{transmission}} {{involves the}} direct {{transmission of the}} same individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to mechanical injection with a syringe. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of HIV cases {{that can be}} attributed to the result of homosexual relations varies according to geography. In Russia, among newly registered HIV cases in 2006 where the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> was known, about one half was due to heterosexual intercourse, and this proportion has been steadily increasing. Almost 60% of cases were attributed to unsafe sex between men. In the Caribbean, it is estimated that about 40% of reported HIV cases are the result of unsafe sex between men. About 53% of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the United States, in 2005, were among men who have sex with men. The largest {{proportion of}} new HIV infection in Canada, in 2002, was accounted for by unprotected sex between men, whereas in Western Europe the highest proportion was accounted for by heterosexual intercourse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> {{schistosomiasis}} are considered. The transmission {{model is}} developed with an aim of establishing possible endemic equilibria within the community. Analysis {{of the model}} reveals that if the recovery rate of human infectives and the death rate of snails δ are increased and if {{at the same time}} the contact rate κ of the human hosts with infested water is reduced, the disease gets eradicated from the community. Otherwise, the disease becomes endemic within the community which is a very much undesirable condition for the human population because of the debilitating nature of schistosomiasis. It is found out that this endemic state becomes stable if both the recovery rate of human infectives and the death rate δ of snails are reduced. It can be made unstable by de-worming the human infectives and killing snails by use of molluscicides. Educating the community about the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> the disease helps in reducing the contact rate with infested waters and hence disease prevention...|$|R
25|$|Results of a {{genome study}} {{reported}} in 2014 suggest that tuberculosis is newer than previously thought. Scientists {{were able to}} recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found {{it was less than}} 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> from Africa to South America. The team from University of Tubingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago. Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when coming up on African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years. This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists. However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field, for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E
500|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} waveguide filter design concerns the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> [...] Systems based on pairs of conducting wires and similar technologies {{have only one}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> [...] In waveguide systems, any number of modes are possible. [...] This can be both a disadvantage, as spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage, as a dual-mode design can be {{much smaller than the}} equivalent waveguide single mode design.
