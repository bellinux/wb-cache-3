40|$|The {{sectional}} high-frequency internally-cooled window, {{as proposed}} by General Atomics, has unique potential for allowing microwave sources to reach multi-megawatt CW levels with application to ECRH. Designs are being investigated using computational electromagnetic (EM), thermal, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>codes</b> at 110 GHz and 170 GHz to examine the design tradeoffs between RF performance and thermal mechanical safety margins. The EM analyses are for the window, under vacuum at one MW and includes variations in {{the shapes of the}} cooling fins, the surface treatment of the window elements themselves, the cooling fin tip treatment, the window pitch angle, and the waveguide effects. One advantage of the distributed cooled window is it`s extensibility to higher power levels. Results in the modeling efforts are presented showing the EM field concentrations (which then will feed into the thermal analysis), the energy scattering/reflection, the transmitted launch angle variation as a function of physical geometry, and the spatial energy distribution and loss as a function of time and position...|$|R

2500|$|Interpretations of The Matrix often {{reference}} Baudrillard's {{philosophy to}} demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays {{from the end of the}} 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel. Bracha Ettinger's matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression [...] "primal matrix" [...] but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their [...] "co-birthing" [...] in a womb-like [...] "shareable time-space", their co-existence in different dimension at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her [...] "archaic" [...] matrix is always in the now and the future, it depends on human affects and desires and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>coded</b> simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of [...] "transconnectedness" [...] in proximity and in distance, which is not global and can't form a [...] "web of webs". Its webs are always specific, invested by an [...] "Eros of borderlinking" [...] and related to different processes that Ettinger has named [...] "metramorphosis" [...] (feminine-maternal-material morpheus). This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.|$|R

40|$|During its {{fabrication}} hydrotest, the {{flanged joint}} between the tubesheet {{and the channel}} of a shell and tube heat exchanger leaked. The design of the joint was confirmed as complying with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Division 1 [1]stress requirements and rigidity index recommendations.

The flanged joint design was judged to be unacceptable and the design was converted to a welded configuration. This paper reports the results of the FE analysis and the ASME BPVC Section VIII Division 1 flange design calculations.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown herein that full {{integration}} of sensor and measurement data can be achieved in numerical procedures via so-called 4 D mechanical correlation. In the present case, load measurements are combined with reconstructed volumes thanks to computed tomography.

In 4 D registrations, the <b>mechanical</b> finite element <b>code</b> was utilized in a non-intrusive way to generate elastoplastic fields. This type of approach is very generic and can be deployed under very different conditions.|$|R
