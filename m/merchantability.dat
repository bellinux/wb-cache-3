2500|$|In November 2009 it was {{announced}} that 10 passengers were to sue Boeing for the incident in the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois, in the United States. It was reported that each of the ten plaintiffs could receive up to US$1,000,000 (about £600,000 at the time) compensation. The lawsuit alleged that the design of the aircraft was [...] "defective and unreasonably dangerous", that Boeing [...] "breached their duty of care" [...] and also breached their [...] "warranties of <b>merchantability</b> and fitness". Claims were settled out-of-court in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{merchandise}} is sold with an express [...] "guarantee", {{the terms of}} the implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> will fill the gaps left by that guarantee. If {{the terms of the}} express guarantee are not specified, they will be considered to be the terms of the implied warranty of <b>merchantability.</b> The UCC allows sellers to disclaim the implied warranty of <b>merchantability,</b> provided the disclaimer is made conspicuously and the disclaimer explicitly uses the term [...] "merchantability" [...] in the disclaimer. [...] Some states, however, have implemented the UCC such that this can not be disclaimed.|$|E
50|$|An implied {{warranty}} of <b>merchantability</b> is a warranty implied by law that goods are reasonably {{fit for the}} general purpose {{for which they are}} sold.|$|E
5000|$|The {{warranty}} of <b>merchantability</b> is implied, unless expressly disclaimed by name, or {{the sale}} is {{identified with the}} phrase [...] "as is" [...] or [...] "with all faults." [...] To be [...] "merchantable", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations, i.e., they are {{what they say they}} are. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects would violate the implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit [...] "as passes ordinarily in the trade". In Massachusetts consumer protection law, it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers.|$|E

50|$|Some jurisdictions, however, {{limit the}} ability of sellers or {{manufacturers}} to disclaim the implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> or fitness, such as Massachusetts.

50|$|In 1797, Baltimore Town {{merged with}} Fells Point and {{incorporated}} as the City of Baltimore. Baltimore grew rapidly, becoming {{the largest city}} in the American South. It dominated the American flour trade after 1800 due to the milling technology of Oliver Evans, the introduction of steam power in processing, and the merchant-millers' development of drying processes which greatly retarded spoilage. Still, by 1830 New York City's competition was felt keenly, and Baltimoreans were hard-pressed to match the <b>merchantability</b> standards despite more rigorous inspection controls than earlier, nor could they match the greater financial resources of their northern rivals.|$|E

50|$|In a redhibitory action, {{the buyer}} demands a full refund or a {{reduction}} in the purchase price because the product has a hidden defect (redhibitory defect) that prevents it from performing the task for which it was purchased. Most consumer products carry an implied warranty of <b>merchantability.</b> If a product is so substantially defective that the buyer would not have bought {{it in the first place}} had they known of its defects, there may be grounds for filing such a suit. It does however differ from lemon laws in a very significant way. Namely, that it applies to any product sold new or used, including real estate, whereas lemon laws typically only apply to new automobiles. In fact, Louisiana does also have a separate lemon law of its own, which like others applies exclusively to automobiles.|$|E

5000|$|Warranties are {{statements}} by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims commonly require privity between the injured {{party and the}} manufacturer or seller; in plain English, this means they must be dealing with each other directly. Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types: (1) breach of an express warranty, (2) breach of an implied warranty of <b>merchantability,</b> and (3) breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Additionally, claims involving real estate may also {{take the form of}} an implied warranty of habitability. Express warranty claims focus on express {{statements by}} the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., [...] "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys"). The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{products}} and services have been merchandised under the [...] "Cofresí" [...] brand, including belts, terrace building companies and a brand of windows named Grand Corsair. Furthermore, countless businesses have used the pirate's reputation to attract customers. There are schools, bakeries, small inns, hotels, grocery stores, bars and villas bearing his name. Restaurants Villa Cofresí in Rincón and la Guarida del Pirata in Toa Baja {{are among the most}} notorious. His name is also used by brands in other markets including presses, clothing and costume lines and ointments to alleviate rheumatism. Non-commercially, a pirate outfit inspired by his legends and incorporating some stereotypical elements was created by designer Carlos Alberto for Miss Puerto Rico 2007 Uma Blasini. The piece was featured during Miss Universe 2007's National Costume Presentation. This trend even made its way to the United States, where an international moving and hauling company, Agencia Cofresí, was named after him. The name holds such notoriety, that Enrique Laguerre once considered writing a book based on his life but intended to rename the protagonist [...] "Roberto Caribe", to avoid exploiting Cofresí's reputation. The author immediately noticed how the work lost its <b>merchantability.</b> Cofresí was the inspiration for numerous folk songs, which reached the commercial music industry via Italian singer Tony Croatto and were also recorded as a bilingual rock opera by Pedro Candelaria.|$|E

40|$|Money now, terms later” agreements, or rolling contracts, {{are commonplace}} in {{consumer}} transactions. Courts frequently allow these agreements to stand. But problems arise when product manufacturers disclaim a warranty that protects consumers, {{such as the}} implied warranty of <b>merchantability,</b> without disclosing the disclaimer upfront—effectively rendering the warranty useless. Suppose, for example, a consumer purchases a refrigerator or computer where the implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> disclaimer is printed on the last page of a thick instruction booklet. The booklet is hidden deep inside the box, buried in a morass of cords and paperwork. The consumer has {{no way of knowing}} about the disclaimer until after she purchases and opens the product. Even then, the disclaimer is quite difficult to find. These “hidden disclaimers” appear to conflict with § 2 - 316 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires that disclaimers be conspicuous. Nevertheless, some courts have upheld hidden disclaimers under a narrow reading of § 2 - 316. Part I of this Comment reviews the history, purpose, and operation of the implied warranty of <b>merchantability.</b> Part II explains the conflict between rolling contract theory and UCC § 2 - 316. Part III identifies problems with hidden disclaimers. In Part IV, I argue that courts should interpret § 2 - 316 ’s conspicuousness requirement to render implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> disclaimers ineffective unless a reasonable consumer would have noticed the disclaimer before making the purchase. This interpretation conforms with § 2 - 316 ’s purpose, compelling policy considerations, and common sense...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the evolution, throughout the harvest season, of <b>merchantability</b> criteria and Ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in cocoa beans produced in Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, 567 samples of cocoa beans, collected in 6 production areas during the 2007 - 2008 season, were analyzed. <b>Merchantability</b> and OTA levels were determined respectively according to the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa stock exchange standards and the European Community regulation related to the analytical methods for the control of mycotoxins levels in foodstuffs (EC 401 / 2006). Concerning <b>merchantability,</b> a significant difference at 5 % risk was revealed between the values of moisture, graining and grades. As regards OTA levels, the concentrations obtained ranged from 0. 41 µg/kg to 1. 36 µg/kg of cocoa beans with an average concentration of 0. 69 µg/kg. These concentrations are all below the maximum value set at 2 µg/kg by the European Commission. Moldy and/or slaty beans are chiefly answerable for the depreciation of cocoa beans marketability. These results served to devise a map summarizing the quality of Ivorian cocoa beans. Needless to say, this map is just a representation of a situation at a given time, and should therefore contribute to take up decisions relevant to the application of good production and postharvest processing practices in the country’s quest for cocoa beans of prime quality. </p...|$|E
