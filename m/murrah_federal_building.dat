5|$|The attack led to {{engineering}} improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which {{were incorporated into}} the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which {{tightened}} the standards for habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated {{on the site of the}} <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building,</b> commemorating the victims of the bombing. Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building,</b> killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
30|$|For example, in 1968, the {{collapse}} of Ronan Building in East London took place due to a gas explosion on the 18 th floor. In 1995, the <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> Office <b>Building</b> in Oklahoma City collapsed due to a terrorist bomb explosion on the ground floor. In 2001, the famous World Trade Center, New York, collapsed due to planes impacting on the towers’ upper levels primary, vertical structural (Shankar 2004). The status of reinforced concrete structures regarding their vulnerability to progressive collapse has become an important question. Guidelines for designing buildings against progressive collapse have been recently developed such as the General Service Administration (GSA) (General Service Administration 2003) guidelines and the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) guidelines (Unified Facilities Criteria 2009). Those guidelines describe two main methods: direct one (Alternative Path Method) and indirect one (Tie Method). For the APM, guidelines allow neglecting slab contribution and rely only on framing actions of beams and columns. Moreover, the contribution of nonstructural infilled walls is not considered. The contribution of the infilled walls and its effect during different load cases was studied in different researches. Hao et al. (2002) found that that the infilled masonry affects not only the damage level but also the damage pattern of the frames. They showed that the empirical damage criterion for surface structures on an underground explosion site is rather conservative for modern reinforced concrete structures, but {{it appears to be}} reasonable for the masonry infilled in the frame. (Razzaghi and Javidnia 2015) found that infilled walls {{play a vital role in}} seismic performance of RC structures. (Tsai and Huang 2013) found that the influence of the partially infilled walls differs from each type. They may increase {{the collapse}} resistance of the building frame under column loss but with decreased ductile capacity. From the structural aspect, with a constant opening rate of 60  %, the wing-type wall is a better option than the parapet- and panel-type walls. The panel-type wall appears to be the worst choice since shear failure of their connected beam members may be induced.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{defining}} characteristics of traumaticevents is their capacity for provoking intense feel-ings of terror, horror, fear and helplessness, as they rep-resent {{a serious threat}} to the life and well-being of indi-viduals (APA, 2000). The profound effect of such events on many people who are exposed to them is well docu-mented (Miguel-Tobal, González Ordi & López Ortega, 2000; Wilson, 2004), and there is no more pertinent example than that of terrorist attacks, events caused by other human beings that generate interpersonal violence in a deliberate manner (Fullerton, Ursano, Norwood & Holloway, 2003). Widely known epidemiological studies on the repercus-sions of terrorist actions such as the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1994 and the bombing of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Murrah</b> <b>building</b> in Oklahoma City in 1995, or more recently, the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington on September 11, 2001, clearly reveal the enormous impact, both psychological and social/community, of such events on the population. At a psychopathological level, the research indicates that among the most prevalent disorders associated with the traumatic response in people affected by terrorism or other types of disaster with comparable effects are post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and increased use and abuse of drugs and alcohol (Breslau, Davis, Andreski &...|$|R

5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P. <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995. Caviezel and Scott did not deny this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at least partly based on McVeigh.

5|$|McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50a.m. At 8:57a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby {{security}} camera that had recorded Nichols' pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building.</b> At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse.

5|$|The <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the first}} hour, 50people were {{rescued from the}} <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building.</b> Victims were sent to every {{hospital}} in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats {{could be used to}} locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.|$|E
5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg.

5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building.</b> Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. <b>Murrah</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations.
