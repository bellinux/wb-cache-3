40|$|Abstract — <b>Multiple</b> <b>paths</b> {{have been}} used to provide loadbalancing of traffic and {{resilience}} to node failures in mobile ad-hoc networks or sensor networks. In addition, the energy expenditure can be distributed among nodes over the <b>multiple</b> <b>paths.</b> However, most existing multi-path routing protocols require their complex procedures such as local repair or periodic reconstruction of the <b>multiple</b> <b>paths,</b> during which much loss of packet is even experienced. In this paper, we therefore propose two versions of an Energyefficient Data Gathering technique using <b>Multiple</b> <b>paths</b> (EDGM), which are more suitable for highly populated wireless sensor networks in terms of having more simple and resilient features than other existing techniques. One of them is {{to make use of the}} <b>multiple</b> shortest <b>paths</b> strictly. The other is to use a neighbor node’s path towards the sink node at the expense of using much longer paths to provide more resilience to node failures. By simulation using ns- 2 simulator, we prove that EDGM versions achieve two goals satisfactorily: energy-saving and resilience to node failure.

Out of five missiles fired against helicopters or high flying aircraft, four were successful, {{but only two}} of nineteen fired at low level aircraft hit: just eleven percent; however a number of missiles were fired without guidance to deter low level attacks.

40|$|Though {{the speed}} of the Internet is {{increasing}} day-by-day, yet there is need of much higher speed. A lot of research is going on to receive any information from Internet just on a click. One way to have more efficient and robust Internet is to identify <b>multiple</b> <b>paths</b> for routing so that routers could flexibly divide traffic over these paths. Often having one or two more paths is generally enough for significant gains in terms of security, performance, and reliability of a network. However, one of the first barriers in multipath routing is to explore the <b>multiple</b> <b>paths</b> over which traffic can be diverted. The principle objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the <b>multiple</b> <b>paths</b> using link utilization factor. For this purpose a multi-path routing algorithm has been proposed that identifies <b>multiple</b> loop-free <b>paths</b> from single source to single destination using local information.

40|$|Abstract. The {{object-oriented}} database management systems store references to objects (implicit joins, precomputed joins), and use path expressions in query languages. One way of executing path expressions is pointer chasing of precomputed joins. However {{it has been}} previously shown that converting implicit joins to explicit joins during the optimization phase may yield better execution plans. A path expression is a linear query, therefore, considering all possible join sequences within a path expression is polynomial {{in the number of}} classes involved. Yet, when the implicit joins are converted to explicit joins in a query involving <b>multiple</b> <b>path</b> expressions bound to the same bind variable, the query becomes a star query and thus considering all possible joins is exponential in the numberofpathsinvolved. This implies {{that there is a need}} for improvement by using heuristic in optimizing queries involving <b>multiple</b> <b>path</b> expressions. A heuristic based approach for optimizing queries involving <b>multiple</b> <b>path</b> expressions is described in this paper. First, given the cost and the selectivities of path expressions by considering a path expression as a unit of processing, we provide an algorithm that gives the optimum execution order of <b>multiple</b> <b>path</b> expressions bound to the same bind variable. For this purpose, we derive the formulas for the selectivities of path expressions. Then by using this ordering as a basis we provide a general heuristic approach for optimizing queries involving <b>multiple</b> <b>path</b> expressions. Two optimizers are developed to compare the performance of the heuristic based approach suggested in this paper with the performance of an optimizer based on an exhaustive search strategy. The exhaustive optimizer is generated through Volcano Optimizer Generator (VOG). The results of the experiments indicate that the heuristic based optimizer has a superior performance with the increasing number of path expressions. ...|$|E

CAMP employs a route discovery mechanism which {{returns to the}} source <b>multiple</b> <b>paths</b> along with ETX (expected transmission count) of all links on each path. With its unique forwarding mechanism, CAMP splits the traffic among <b>multiple</b> <b>paths</b> and actively creates, while not merely waiting for, the coding opportunity by switching its path to maximize the switching gain and thus improves the network throughput. The experimental results demonstrate that CAMP can achieve much higher throughput than peer schemes for delivering packets in wireless networks...|$|R
