5|$|Shaughnessy mentored <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> Bill George as the {{defensive}} play-caller. Bears coach Abe Gibron likened George to having Shaughnessy {{himself on the}} field. Shaughnessy worked to counter {{the increasing use of}} the forward pass. He emphasized man-to-man coverage, dropped linebackers or defensive ends into pass coverage, and utilized blitzes from multiple directions—which had previously consisted mostly of just a <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{managed to}} regain a {{starting}} {{spot on the}} Bears' roster, after Barry Minter, the team's veteran <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker,</b> was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. Not even a rib cage injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher {{went on to win}} the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker.</b> Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, the Minnesota Vikings {{acquired}} Alipate for use {{on special}} teams. Throughout the season, Alipate was also used as a backup for multiple positions, including the <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> and strongside linebacker. He played in all 16 regular season games that year, but Alipate's playing time was limited mostly to special teams. Alipate was cut from the Vikings after training camp in 1996 in favor of first-round draft pick Duane Clemons. Alipate tried out for the Vikings in 1998 but was not signed by the team.|$|E
5000|$|Inside linebackers: Inside linebackers ("ILB"), {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> ("MLB") set up on the inside portion of the line of scrimmage. ILBs tend to be the biggest and strongest linebackers on the defense.|$|R
50|$|Willis, who was {{regarded}} as one of the best <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> in the league, played in just six games in 2014 as he dealt with a toe injury. He announced in March his decision to retire at age 30 due to the chronic nature of the foot injuries he had endured in his eight-year career.|$|R
5|$|Linebackers line {{up behind}} the {{defensive}} line but {{in front of the}} defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.|$|R
5|$|Florida State's {{defense was}} ranked No. 43 {{in the country}} at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season. The Seminoles allowed 356.36 yards per game, on average. State's rushing defense was ranked No. 32 (126 ypg), while its passing defense was ranked No. 76 (230.36 ypg). The Seminoles' defensive squad was led by <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> Bradley Jennings, who had 121 tackles during the regular season—the most on the team. Defensive tackle Darnell Dockett also was a standout performer statistically for the Seminoles, leading the team in tackles for loss and setting the single-season and single-game Florida State records in that category.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{played the}} Orange Bowl without {{starting}} linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who fractured his shoulder {{in the second}} quarter of the ACC Championship Game. Gibson was fourth on the team in tackles with 66. Replacing Gibson was redshirt freshman Tariq Edwards, who played only a few times before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies also returned a player from injury for the Orange Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been predicted to be Tech's starting <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker,</b> suffered a torn quadriceps tendon in offseason workouts, causing him to miss every game. Heading into the Orange Bowl, coaches were optimistic that he had healed enough to be able to play.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the regular season. He was quickly brought back to the active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw regular playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen regular season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker,</b> but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice at the outside linebacker position while he was recovering illness and injury. Allen finished the regular season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also recovered a fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E
50|$|Tubbs was {{an impact}} player on those early Cowboys teams and also rated {{among the top}} <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> in the NFL. He had quickness, {{toughness}} and an unbeatable motor.

5|$|As expected, Ezeh, who had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury, redshirted his freshman year. Prior to his redshirt freshman season, he changed jersey numbers from 44 to 45 as he converted from fullback to linebacker. On May 22, 2007, {{he was charged with}} suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated for an incident when his vehicle struck a utility pole on the same street on which he lives while his blood-alcohol content was 0.11% (the legal limit in Michigan is 0.08%). Ezeh pleaded not guilty, and the trial was scheduled for September 19 in the 15th District Court. The time of the accident was outside the permissible times for Ezeh's restricted driving license that resulted from a prior non-alcohol-related accident. On the football field, redshirt freshman Ezeh entered the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team in a three-way battle to replace NFL-bound David Harris at <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> with redshirt junior John Thompson and junior college transfer Austin Panter, who had been named national junior college defensive player of the year. Harris also hailed from Grand Rapids and had worn the number 45. The week before the season opener, The Detroit News declared Ezeh the starter, however, the Ann Arbor News and Ezeh's hometown The Grand Rapids Press both stated that the race between Ezeh and Thompson was undecided heading into the game. In the aftermath of the September 1, opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, more was made of the fact that both players had trouble playing the position than who had started the game. Ezeh started the first game, but lost his spot to Thompson in the next two. After three weeks of play, Thompson, who had been voted the hardest hitter on the team the previous two seasons, had established himself as the starter by ranking second on the team in tackles. However, although Thompson had stepped up to the role he was notable for having trouble with pass coverage. Ezeh accumulated no statistics in the third and fourth game, but recorded his first interception in the fifth game on September 29 against Northwestern on a deflected pass. Ezeh started that game because of an injury. The following week, he again started in place of the injured Thompson and recorded nine tackles against Eastern Michigan. He also forced a fumble and fielded one kickoff return. Even though Thompson recovered from his ankle injury after four weeks, Ezeh retained the starting job the remainder of the season for a total of ten starts. Thompson only recorded four tackles the rest of the year. On November 1, his lawyer stated that on August 29 Ezeh had pleaded guilty to an operating while visibly intoxicated charge, which is a serious misdemeanor but a lesser charge than the original operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and had sought alcohol counseling prior to his sentence. The plea resulted in a year's probation, three days in a work release program, a substantial payment covering fines, court costs and restitution. He committed to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class. In the November 3 Paul Bunyan Trophy victory against Michigan State he recorded a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. One of the sacks occurred on Michigan State's final series of downs in Michigan territory to help secure the 2824 win. Ezeh recorded 12 tackles in the Michigan – Ohio State rivalry game against Ohio State on November 17 to end the regular season.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Broncos {{switched}} to a 3-4 defense in which Gradishar moved from <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> to inside linebacker, where he stayed {{the remainder of his}} career. The switch to the 3-4 defense gave Gradishar responsibilities relative to rush-lane discipline and pass coverage that are beyond those of a <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> in the 4-3 defense. In addition to leading the Broncos in tackles for the second straight year, Gradishar led all NFL linebackers in sacks, with seven. He was voted second-team All-AFC by United Press International.|$|E
25|$|Following the game, with 16 tackles, and 2 forced fumbles, <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> Barrett Ruud {{was named}} the NFC Defensive Player of the Week on Wednesday September 19.|$|E
50|$|Wilson {{became the}} anchor of the Broncos' defense and earned five Pro Bowl selections. He {{was one of}} the fastest <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> in the league and was very good in pass coverage. He passed the 100-tackle mark in five {{consecutive}} seasons, including 109 tackles (73 of which were solo) in 2004 to rank second on the Broncos. Wilson led the Broncos in tackles for the second consecutive year in 2003 with 128 tackles.|$|R

[...] Wells moved {{on to become the}} defensive coordinator at South Carolina State University in 2002. As the Bulldog's defensive coordinator (2002-2005) Wells' defense attained numerous national rankings and a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference championship (2004).|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} one of the best draft years for <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers,</b> with two {{potential}} hall of famers in Ray Lewis and Zach Thomas selected. Lewis won Super Bowl XXXV and was selected MVP of that game. Lewis also won Super Bowl XLVII in the final game of his career, and made 13 career Pro Bowls while Thomas has made 7. Other linebackers who made at least one Pro Bowl from this draft are Tedy Bruschi, Kevin Hardy, Simeon Rice, John Mobley, and Donnie Edwards. Randall Godfrey, Earl Holmes, and Carlos Emmons also had solid careers in the league.|$|R
5000|$|In Cover 2 the cornerbacks are {{considered}} to be [...] "hard" [...] corners, meaning that they have increased run stopping responsibilities and generally defend against shorter passes, although if two receivers run a deep route on a certain side of the field, that side's corner has deep coverage responsibility as well. The [...] "hard" [...] corners also generally bear the responsibility of [...] "pressing" [...] or [...] "jamming" [...] the offensive receivers- disrupting the receivers intended path downfield. It also relies heavily on the [...] "Mike" [...] (<b>Middle)</b> <b>linebacker's</b> ability to quickly drop deep downfield into pass coverage when he reads a pass.|$|R
25|$|The Jets defense led the AFL {{in total}} rushing yards allowed (1,195). Gerry Philbin, Paul Rochester, John Elliott, and Verlon Biggs {{anchored}} the defensive line. The Jets linebacking core {{was led by}} <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> Al Atkinson. The secondary was led by defensive backs Johnny Sample (a former Colt who played on their 1958 NFL Championship team) who recorded 7 interceptions, and Jim Hudson, who recorded 5.|$|E
25|$|Despite Revis' {{outstanding}} season, {{he was not}} {{an ideal}} fit for Tampa Bay's defensive system. When Lovie Smith was hired to replace Greg Schiano, he brought his Tampa 2 defense with him, a zone defense that is focused on an elite <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker,</b> not a shutdown corner. Revis, being an elite man-to-man cornerback, was rumored to be on the trading block because of his large $16 million salary for the 2014 season.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Butkus {{was named}} the second-team <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> on the All-Pro teams of the AP, UPI, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and New York Daily News, with each {{selector}} placing him behind Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay Packers.

After the year, he went to the Canadian Football League (CFL) and played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He spent the 2000 and 2001 seasons in the Arena Football League with the Milwaukee Mustangs. In the AFL, Young played both fullback and linebacker. Following the AFL, Young joined the short-lived XFL with the Orlando Rage. After the league folded, Young attempted to make the Jacksonville Jaguars roster, but was waived during {{training camp}}. He rejoined the AFL, this time with the Indiana Firebirds, in 2002. He would spend the next two years in Indiana before joining the Colorado Crush in 2004. In 2003, he led all AFL <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers</b> with 4.0 sacks.|$|R
25|$|Thompson {{was drafted}} in 1948 by the Washington Redskins of the NFL, but he instead {{signed with the}} Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown. Led by a sturdy defense and an offense that {{featured}} quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and end Dante Lavelli, the Browns finished with a 9–1–2 record in 1949 and won the AAFC championship. Thompson spent some time at center during his rookie year, but was mostly a <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> in the Browns' 5-3 defense in his first three seasons.|$|E
25|$|Three {{of their}} four {{starters}} in the defensive secondary were {{named to the}} Pro Bowl: Cornerback Lito Sheppard (1 sack, 5 interceptions, 172 return yards and 2 touchdowns), safety Michael Lewis (88 tackles, 2 forced fumbles, 1 sack, and 1 interception) and safety Brian Dawkins (3 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovery, and 4 interceptions for 40 return yards), while their fourth starter, cornerback Sheldon Brown, also enjoyed a solid year (89 tackles, 3 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 2 interceptions). Their defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon (5.5 sacks) and defensive ends Jevon Kearse (7.5 sacks, Pro Bowl) and Derrick Burgess. Pro Bowl <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker</b> Jeremiah Trotter, who only started 9 games, recorded 69 tackles and 1 sack.|$|E
25|$|Succeeding Hall of Famer Bill George at <b>middle</b> <b>linebacker,</b> Butkus made an {{immediate}} impact as a rookie. He {{established himself as}} a ball hawk by intercepting five passes and recovering seven opponents' fumbles, and he was also credited unofficially with having forced six fumbles. Against the New York Giants on November 28, he intercepted a pass and recovered a fumble, and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Week by the AP for the first of four times in his career. He finished third in balloting for the AP's rookie of the year award, behind Sayers and Ken Willard of the San Francisco 49ers, with AP sportswriter Jack Hand remarking that Butkus would have certainly won if there was a separate award for defenders. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the AP and was invited to his first of eight straight Pro Bowls.|$|E
5000|$|Knox {{then moved}} to the Detroit Lions on February 13, 1967 under new head coach Joe Schmidt, {{spending}} six seasons in the Motor City. Despite some impressive stretches, the Lions only reached the postseason once during this period, losing a 5-0 road contest to the Dallas Cowboys in 1970. However, Knox developed effectively cohesive offensive lines and developed pass-blocking techniques that are now standard in blocking fundamentals. Additionally, he proved a progressive coach by playing Bill Cottrell, an African American, at center. [...] "There was an unwritten rule back then", said Cottrell in Hard Knox: The Life of an NFL Coach. [...] "No black quarterbacks, no black <b>middle</b> <b>linebackers,</b> no black centers." [...] Because of Knox's liberal views and ability to relate to players on such a personal level, African American players nicknamed him, [...] "Dolomite." ...|$|R
