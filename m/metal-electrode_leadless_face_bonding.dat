5000|$|... 2. Typically, thermocompression {{bonds are}} made with {{delivering}} heat and pressure to the mating surface by a hard <b>faced</b> <b>bonding</b> tool. Compliant bonding is a unique method of forming this type of solid state bond between a gold lead and a gold surface since heat and pressure is transmitted through a compliant or deformable media. The use of the compliant medium ensures the physical integrity of the lead by controlling the extent of wire deformation. The process also allows one to bond a multiple number of gold wires of various dimensions simultaneously since the compliant media ensures contacting and deforming all the lead wires.|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard <b>faced</b> tool thermocompression <b>bonding</b> all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard <b>faced</b> <b>bonding</b> tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard <b>faced</b> <b>bonding</b> tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|R
40|$|A first-principles {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the stability of the}} crystal structure of beta-form belite (beta-C 2 S) substituted by Sr atoms as trace impurities for Ca atoms in CaOx polyhedra. The effect of the connection types of CaOx polyhedral, in the form of common-edge bond and common-face bond, upon the crystal stability is described. The Ca-Ca interatomic distance closely relates to the hydraulic activity of beta-C 2 S. The beta-C 2 S substituted by an Sr atom for Ca(1) atoms having seven Ca-O bonds is energetically more stable than that substituted by an Sr atom for Ca(2) atoms having eight Ca-O bonds. The Sr-doped beta-C 2 S having a common <b>face</b> <b>bond</b> with SrOx polyhedra is energetically more favorable and results in structural stability compared with that having a common edge bond with SrOx polyhedra...|$|R
40|$|Glued-laminated timber (glulam) is a {{wood product}} formed by <b>face</b> <b>bonding</b> lumber {{laminations}} in a prearranged {{order to create}} larger structural members. Capable of spanning greater lengths and carrying greater loads, glulam has advanced wood as a building material. Although glulam timber offers significant improvement over sawn timber, its ultimate bending strength often remains limited by strength reducing flaws, such as knots and finger joints, in the tension zone. Tensile reinforcement of glulam has been researched in the past, most commonly using metal reinforcement, without commercial success. Recent advances in high strength composites, such as pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), offer new opportunity to further engineer glulam.
