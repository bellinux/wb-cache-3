40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze why ozone can be <b>medically</b> <b>useful</b> when it dissolves in blood or in other {{biological}} fluids. In reviewing a number of clinical studies performed in Peripheral Arterial Diseases (PAD) during the last decades, it has been possible to confirm the long-held view that the inverted U-shaped curve, typical of the hormesis concept, is suitable to represent the therapeutic activity exerted by the so-called ozonated autohemotherapy. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of human blood ozonation have been also critically reviewed in regard to the biological, therapeutic and safety of ozone. It is hoped that this gas, although toxic for the pulmonary system during prolonged inhalation, will be soon recognized as a <b>useful</b> <b>agent</b> in oxidative-stress related diseases, joining other medical gases recently thought to be of therapeutic importance. Finally, the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of ozone as well as the obtained results in PAD may encourage clinical scientists to evaluate ozone therapy in vascular diseases in comparison to the current therapies. </p...|$|R

Similar to the production of antibiotics through secondary metabolism of other actinomyces (Bibb 2005; Medema et al. 2010; Wentzel et al. 2012), the synthesis process of erythromycin is also complex and is largely influenced by the composition of the media and culture condition (Martin and Bushell 1996; Mcdermott et al. 1993; Rostamza et al. 2008).|$|R
