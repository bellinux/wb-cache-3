Regulation 473/2013: On common {{provisions}} for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area.If the eurozone member {{state is not}} involved in an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) or Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP) or Financial assistance programme, the only extra monitor requirement (compared to the SGP) will be for the member state to submit its draft fiscal budget for the upcoming year to the European Commission: no later than 15 October; and it shall then await receiving the Commission's opinion before it is debated and voted for in the national parliament. The European Commission will not be granted any veto right over the national parliaments potential pass of a fiscal budget, but will have the role to issue warnings in advance to the national parliaments, if the proposed draft budget is found to compromise the debt and deficit rules outlined by the European Fiscal Compact. The reporting requirements towards Eurozone member states subject to open EDP's are regulated by article 6 to 12, outlining that [...] "status reports for corrective action" [...] shall be published by 6 months intervals from the moment the Council has granted the country an official deadline for EDP correction, and with the frequency increased to quarterly reports for those [...] "Member States persisting in failing to put into practice the recommendations of the Council" [...] for corrective measures to remedy the excessive deficit situation - leading to a Council notice for immediate implementation of deficit reduction measures in accordance with article 126(9) of the TFEU. Article 6 to 12 does not apply for those Member States with open EDP's who are also subject to a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme</b> - as their increased reporting requirements are specifically outlined by regulation 472/2013.|$|E

The first chapter describes Cyprus as a country that is divided into two parts, yet has become an EU member state. The chapter focuses on previous and current efforts for reunification of Cyprus; the process of adoption of the euro in Cyprus and the Cyprus presidency of the Council of the EU are mentioned as well. The second chapter compares Cyprus and the other EU member states using geographic, demographic, political and primarily economic indicators from before the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008. The last chapter studies changes in these indicators after 2008, and briefly describes the Cyprus' <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an independent {{evaluation of the}} Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) carried out in 2015. IFAC was set up as an independent fiscal institution in 2011 to monitor the fiscal policy of the Irish government. Similar fiscal “watchdogs” have emerged across Europe following {{the crisis in the}} euro area. This report presents conclusions and recommendations concerning the performance of IFAC. The focus is on five main issues: the mandate, the financial and human resources, the output, the impact (communication strategy) of IFAC and the relationship between the EU fiscal framework and the Irish framework. A general conclusion is that IFAC has, so far, served the Irish fiscal policy process well. With Ireland having exited its <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme</b> and a return to economic health, IFAC now faces new challenges in keeping Ireland on a sustainable fiscal path...|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the four}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> – in Portugal and Ireland – can be {{considered}} a success {{in the sense that the}} initial expectations in terms of adjustment, both fiscal and external, were broadly fulfilled. A rebound based on exports has taken hold in these two countries, but a full recovery will take years. In Greece the initial plans were insufficient. While the strong impact of the fiscal adjustment on demand could have been partially anticipated at the time, the resistance to structural reforms was more surprising and remains difficult to cure. The fiscal adjustment is now almost completed, but the external adjustment has not proceeded well. Exports are stagnating despite impressive falls in wage costs. In Cyprus, the outcome has so far been less severe than initially feared. It is still too early to find robust evidence in any country that the programmes have increased the long-term growth potential. Survey-based evidence suggests that structural reforms have not yet taken hold. The EU-led <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> outside the euro area (e. g.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is developed {{in which both}} buybacks and the adoption of an IMF programme {{can be used as}} screening devices which enable a creditor to discriminate between debtor countries which are willing to use debt relief in order to invest and repay and countries which are not. Asymmetric information is assumed. This problem can be solved if the country has su¢cient resources to engage in a debt buyback and so gain the debt relief. When the country is credit constrained (which seems more plausible), an alternative screening mechanism is to undertake an IMF programme in return for debt reduction and possibly an IMF loan. Since the inception of the developing countries debt crisis in 1982, agreement to follow an IMF approved programme has frequently been a formal prerequisite for a country to bene…t from debt relief and rescheduling negotiated through both Paris and London clubs. In particular, the Brady Plan deals were contingent on a satisfactory <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme,</b> typically {{in the form of an}} IMF stabilisation agreement. 1 The Brady deals involved a combination of an IMF agreement and debt and debt-service reduction from the banks.

40|$|Banking sector reforms, {{which is}} a major {{component}} of <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> in India, has changed the trends and patterns of banking over the last six to seven years. This paper seeks to analyse the trends in credit deployment by industry, by bank group, by rural and urban areas, and by states over the recent period. The argument of the paper is that serious regional and sectoral inequalities are developing in the deployment of commercial credit in this country. The economic reasoning for nationalising the major banks in 1969 was the imperfection in the allocation of credit. With bank nationalisation there was a rapid expansion of the banking network into rural and semi-urban areas, and an increase in the share of agriculture and small industry and transport and trade in the total credit deployed. The banking sector reforms have changed this trend. The number of loan accounts has fallen by 60 lakhs in six years, and the fall is largely confined to agriculture, transport operators and trade. The new private banks and foreign banks are increasing their presence in the emerging business of loans for personal and professional services. There is a striking regional dimension to the developments of the last few years. The emerging banks and the existing ones are competing to expand in South, and North-West India attracted by the growing credit business in a milieu with strong banking habits. This has resulted in a drastic reallocation of total commercial credit from the poorer agricultural states to Delhi, Maharastra and Tamilnadu. The situation is one where private banks are left to "skim the cream" without investing in the long-term development of banking habits. banking sector reforms, nationalisation, directed credit...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{analysis}} is {{to assess the impact}} of the crisis on the potential output and output gaps, to study their evolution by using a comparative approach for a sample of EU countries that were in majority included recently in financial assistance and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes.</b> The potential GDP growth rates calculated using the Cobb Douglas production function and Hodrick-Prescott methodology, decelerated substantially across the board in the countries studied once the international economic and financial crisis hit, recording even negative rates of growth in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain. In addition to the specific factors that characterise each country, there is a series of common features that will affect the developments of the potential GDP on a long-term basis, such as the increase of global risk aversion correlated with the reduction of the banking exposures, the slow economic recovery in the EU, and last but not least the incoming ageing process, which will exert an additional negative impact on the growth potential of the EU member states. The article makes a series of economic policy recommendations to promote key measures aiming to increase the flexibility of the goods, services, and labour markets, to improve the prioritisation of public expenditures especially capital spending, and to improve the management of the public assets including real estate and public buildings by promoting a mix of measures including privatisation, monetisation and a wider involvement of the private sector in their management...|$|R

In addition to the <b>macroeconomic</b> factors, Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> (SAP) over the period 1981 to 2013 will be included into the scenario of this study {{to examine the effects}} of these factors on agricultural output in Nigeria. This paper employed co-integration analysis and multivariate Granger causality which is carried out using VECM approach to analyse the causal links among all the variables considered for estimation. The findings showed relationship that exists between the agricultural output which is the dependent variable and the independent variables. It also revealed the variations between the dependent and independent variables which are Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate, interest rate, foreign direct investment (FDI), commercial bank loan on agriculture, SAP and inflation rate. In conclusion, commercial loan on agriculture, FDI, interest and inflation rate were macroeconomic variables that contributed to agricultural output in Nigeria within the period examined...|$|R

Those authors integrate the Polak monetary model of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> with a two-gap growth model to study `adjustment with growth'. Here we nest both the Polak and the Khan and Montiel models in a very conventional macro-model.

We conclude that in the design of growth-oriented based <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes,</b> attention should be paid to supply-side features not present in the Khan and Montiel model, and suggest that such programmes require a wider range of measures than appears necessary from that model.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the micro impacts of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies is quite new. It developed out of the concern that adjustment policies adopted by governments to correct macroeconomic imbalances have affected various groups in the economy differently. The experience of several countries who have undertaken adjustment policies have indicated that these policies tended to be deflationary and {{that most of the}} adjustment costs have been borne by the more vulnerable groups. The predominantly deflationary nature of adjustment policies led to depressed employment and real income resulting to higher poverty incidence. Moreover, some macro policies have direct negative effects on the welfare of these vulnerable groups (Cornia, Jolly and Stewart, 1987). In response to the search for alternative adjustment paths that would minimize the social costs, the Micro Impacts of <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Policies (MIMAP) Project was conceived. Under Phase I of the MIMAP Project, Lamberte et al (1991) developed a general framework for analyzing the micro impacts of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{empirical}} evidence on the growth rates of maize production in three sub - periods in Nigeria namely pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period, Structural <b>Adjustment</b> Program period and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period. Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period (1970 to 1985), Structural Adjustment period (1986 to 1994) and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme,</b> Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> periods respectively. The higher compound growth rate of maize production in the Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period implies that the policy reforms in the period was more effective in ensuring increased growth of maize production over that of other periods in Nigeria.
