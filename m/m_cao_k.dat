We identified also the early emergence of vasogenic edema, which increased consistently before and after reperfusion (p < 0. 0001). The perfusion of the penumbra correlated more strongly to the perfusion of adjacent tissue regions than did the perfusion of regions undergoing infarction (p = 0. 0088).

The results showed that CO 2 gasification of polystyrene completed at 470 °C, which was {{lower than those of}} other carbonaceous materials. This behaviour was attributed to the high volatile content coupled with its unique thermal degradation properties. It was found that the initial decomposition temperature of blends decreased with the increasing amount of waste carbonaceous materials in the blends. In this study, results demonstrated that CO 2 co-gasification process was enhanced as a direct consequence of interactions between coal and carbonaceous materials in the blends. The intensity and temperature of occurrence of these interactions were influenced by the chemical properties and composition of the carbonaceous materials in the blends. The strongest interactions were observed in coal/polystyrene blend at the devolatilisation stage as indicated by the highest value of Root Mean Square Interaction Index (RMSII), which was due to the highly reactive nature of polystyrene.

W., ''Evaluation of {{registration}} methods on thoracic CT: the EMPIRE 10 challenge'', IEEE transactions {{on medical}} imaging, vol. 30, no. 11, pp. 1901 - 1920, November 2011. EMPIRE 10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) {{is a public}} platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intrapatient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This {{is compounded by the}} fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE 10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE 10 website ([URL] The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Although loess–paleosol {{sequences}} {{are among}} the most important records of Quaternary climate change and past dust deposition cycles, few modern examples of such sedimentation systems have been studied. Stratigraphic studies and 22 new accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages from the Matanuska Valley in southern Alaska show that loess deposition there began sometime after 6500 14 C yr B. P. and has continued to the present. The silts are produced through grinding by the Matanuska and Knik glaciers, deposited as outwash, entrained by strong winds, and redeposited as loess. Over a downwind distance of 40 km, loess thickness, sand content, and sand-pluscoarse- silt content decrease, whereas fine-silt content increases. Loess deposition was episodic, as shown by the presence of paleosols, at distances 3 ̆e 10 km from the outwash plain loess source. Stratigraphic complexity is at a maximum (i. e., the greatest number of loesses and paleosols) at intermediate (10 – 25 km) distances from the loess source. Surface soils increase in degree of development with distance downwind from the source, where sedimentation rates are lower. Proximal soils are Entisols or Inceptisols, whereas distal soils are Spodosols. Ratios of mobile <b>CaO,</b> <b>K</b> 2 O, and Fe 2 O 3 to immobile TiO 2 show decreases in surface horizons with distance from the source. Thus, as in China, where loess deposition also takes place today, eolian sedimentation and soil formation are competing processes. Study of loess and paleosols in southern Alaska shows that particle size can vary over short distances, loess deposition can be episodic over limited time intervals, and soils developed in stabilized loess can show considerable variability under the same vegetation...|$|R
