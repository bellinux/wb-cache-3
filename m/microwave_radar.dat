5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a <b>microwave</b> <b>radar</b> set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US <b>microwave</b> <b>radar</b> set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on <b>microwave</b> <b>radar</b> at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|McMillan's abrupt {{departure}} {{was caused}} by the outbreak of World War II in Europe. In November 1940, he began working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he participated in the development and testing of airborne <b>microwave</b> <b>radar</b> during World War II. He conducted tests in April 1941 with the radar operating from an old Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Flying over the Naval Submarine Base New London with Luis Walter Alvarez and Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, they showed that the radar was able to detect the conning tower of a partly submerged submarine. MacMillan married Elsie Walford Blumer in New Haven, Connecticut, on June 7, 1941. Her father was George Blumer, Dean Emeritus of the Yale Medical School. Her sister Mary was Lawrence's wife. The McMillans had three children: Ann Bradford, David Mattison and Stephen Walker.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency <b>microwave</b> <b>radar.</b> EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} <b>microwave</b> <b>radar</b> and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In July 1933, Parsons became {{liaison officer}} between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed {{by the head}} of its Radio Division, A. Hoyt Taylor, who told him about {{experiments}} that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name radar. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he realized {{that he was going to}} need high frequency microwaves. He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was able to persuade the scientists to establish a group to investigate <b>microwave</b> <b>radar,</b> but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research. To his dismay, the BuOrd and Bureau of Engineering, which was responsible for the NRL, turned his proposal down.|$|E

25|$|Lightning {{scattering}} {{has sometimes}} been observed on VHF and UHF over distances of about 500km. The hot lightning channel scatters radio-waves {{for a fraction of}} a second. The RF noise burst from the lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure. Although the hot lightning channel is briefly observable with <b>microwave</b> <b>radar,</b> no practical use for this mode has been found in communications.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1940, the British and American governments {{made the}} {{decision}} to exchange information on their defense technologies and enter into shared developments. The Tizard Mission initiated this exchange, bringing to America their most secret items. Among these was the cavity magnetron.

Before the end of the year, the Radiation Laboratory (commonly called the Rad Lab) was established in facilities at MIT with the primary purpose of consolidating development of <b>microwave</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|E

50|$|Conical {{scanning}} {{was similar}} in concept to lobe switching, {{but as the}} name implies it was operated in a rotary fashion instead of two directions. This allowed the operator to get a 2-D view of which direction had the strongest return, and was much easier to operate as a result. However, conical scanning could only easily be used on an antenna with a single feed horn, which is only practical with <b>microwave</b> <b>radars.</b> As such systems were introduced into service, lobe switching generally disappeared.|$|R
25|$|As enemy aliens, {{at least}} until Peierls' {{naturalisation}} papers came through in February 1940, Frisch and Peierls were generally excluded from the most important–and secret–war work being done by Oliphant's team at Birmingham, that on radar. However, Oliphant would ask Peierls a theoretical question about, say, the solution to Maxwell's equations in a hemispheric cavity. Peierls knew that questions of this nature related to the work on <b>microwave</b> <b>radar,</b> and Oliphant was doubtless aware of this too, but the façade of secrecy was maintained. The nuclear investigation was not yet secret, so Frisch was available to work on it. He began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources.|$|E
25|$|Early in World War II, {{physicists}} in the United Kingdom {{invented the}} magnetron, a specialized microwave-generating electron tube that markedly improved {{the capability of}} radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and mass-produce the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and shipborne radar systems, and, {{with support from the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory (recently formed to investigate <b>microwave</b> <b>radar),</b> Raytheon received a contract to build the devices. Within a few months of being awarded the contract, Raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems. At war's end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured. During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon ranked 71st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.|$|E
25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Ward Island had {{many of the}} same topics at the three ARM Secondary Schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy’s airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust – often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. <b>Microwave</b> <b>radar,</b> which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their mechanical drives. Sonar was not included, but there was more attention given to recognition (IFF), direction-finding, and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1).|$|E

The Radiation Laboratory produced the designs, which were prototyped by Raytheon, and then tested by the laboratory. In June 1941, Ramsey travelled to Britain, where he met with Oliphant, and the two exchanged ideas. He brought back some British components which were incorporated into the final design. A night fighter aircraft, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, was designed around the new radar.

These techniques allow <b>microwave</b> <b>radars</b> to achieve image resolution which would otherwise require excessively large antennas. Recent advances in coherent laser radar techniques and signal processing {{have led to the}} development of range-Doppler imaging laser radars. While much of the theory and signal processing techniques used in <b>microwave</b> <b>radars</b> can be brought to bear on laser radars, the significant difference in wavelength results in issues peculiar to laser radar systems. Both the fundamental concepts and specific applications of diversity {{imaging techniques}} applied to laser radar imaging systems will be discussed. Angle, frequency, and bistatic angle degrees of freedom can be employed in a coherent laser radar imaging system to achieve image resolution which exceeds the traditional Rayleigh criterion associated with the receive aperture. In diversity imaging, angle and frequency degrees of freedom can be used to synthesize an effective aperture providing range and Doppler target information. The ability to vary the bistatic angle provides an additional means of synthesizing an effective aperture. Both simulated and experimentally obtained laser radar images of spinning and/or tumbling objects utilizing both angular and frequency diversity will be presented. In coherent laser radar systems, image quality can be dominated by laser speckle effects. In particular, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a coherent laser radar image is at most unity in the presence of fully developed speckle. Diversity techniques can be utilized to improve the image SNR; simple incoherent averaging of images utilizing temporal and polarization degrees of freedom can significantly improve image SNR. Both the SNR and image resolution (as defined by the synthetic aperture) contribute to image quality. The relationship between the available degrees of freedom and image quality are discussed...|$|R
