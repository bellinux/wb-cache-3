5|$|The Cabernet Sauvignon grape {{itself is}} very small, {{with a thick}} skin, {{creating}} a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp). From these elements the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and flavor of the wine—especially if the must is subjected to long periods of <b>maceration</b> (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the <b>maceration</b> period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. The results of these long <b>maceration</b> periods are very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of aging. Wine producers that wish to make a wine more approachable {{within a couple of}} years will drastically reduce the <b>maceration</b> time to as a little as a few days. Following <b>maceration,</b> the Cabernet must can be fermented at high temperatures up to 30 °C (86 °F). The temperature of fermentation will {{play a role in the}} result, with deeper colors and more flavor components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavors are maintained at lower temperature. In Australia there has been experimentation with carbonic <b>maceration</b> to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.|$|E

5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} grapes of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs. Cinsault is also {{commonly}} used in rosé production along with Lladoner Pelut, Picpoul noir, Terret noir, and Grenache. Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some of the oldest vines in France are Carignan grapes. Winemakers often use carbonic <b>maceration</b> to soften the tannins.|$|E
50|$|Phytoclasts are {{microscopic}} plant fragments {{present in}} the fossil record, usually found in palynological preparations and acid <b>macerations,</b> and include banded tubes and various nematophytes.|$|R
50|$|The spines often {{comprise}} {{layers of}} phosphate, {{with a central}} void often infilled with diagenetic phosphate.Similar spines have been recovered from acid <b>macerations,</b> where they are preserved as films of organic carbon.|$|R
25|$|Woods: Highly {{important}} in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include sandalwood, rosewood, agarwood, birch, cedar, juniper, and pine. These {{are used in}} the form of <b>macerations</b> or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.|$|R
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. <b>Maceration</b> (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{during this}} <b>maceration,</b> the {{fermentation}} process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar. Often the wine will have fermented {{to the point}} where the grape spirits are added before <b>maceration</b> has ended and the wine is pressed off the skins, a process known as mutage sur grains. The added alcohol during <b>maceration</b> allows for more ethanol-soluble phenolics and flavor compounds to be extracted. After pressing, the wine is left to settle in concrete vats over the winter before it is racked into barrels or other containers.|$|E
25|$|Rosés can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (<b>maceration).</b> During <b>maceration,</b> phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have <b>maceration</b> last several days to even several weeks, the very limited <b>maceration</b> of rosés means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the stomatal apparatus of the leaf of Lycopodium japonicum Thumb was studied using epidermal <b>macerations,</b> sections and scanning electron microscopy. The stomatal apparatus of L. japonicum consists of two large guard cells and pore, and is anomocytic. Based on light microscopy, the impression from epidermal <b>macerations</b> {{that there were two}} small guard cells surrounded by two, large, similarly shaped, subsidiary cells (paracytic) derives from a pronounced elliptical cuticular ledge {{on the surface of the}} guard cells surrounding a thickened circumporal area. A similar appearance is characteristic of cuticle preparations of the Devonian lycophyte Drepanophycus spinaeformis Göppert. We therefore conclude, as did W. H. Lang over 70 years ago, that the stomata of the early lycophyte were also anomocytic, as were those of a second species of Drepanophycus, D. qujingensis...|$|R
50|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{also used}} in acid <b>macerations</b> to extract organic fossils from {{silicate}} rocks. Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.|$|R
25|$|The {{winemaker}} can {{soak the}} skins of white grapes and practice <b>maceration</b> if {{the quality of}} the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation <b>Maceration</b> is generally performed at a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of varietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids (large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a perfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and sulphite to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at 18°C) depends on the variety, the temperature of <b>maceration,</b> the maturity of the grape, and {{the quality of the}} soil.|$|E
25|$|Produced {{from red}} {{varieties}} with a shorter <b>maceration,</b> the wine must have pale red or clear red color.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the <b>maceration</b> method {{which gives}} some, albeit very brief, {{time for the}} juice to be {{in contact with the}} skins vin gris are wines made from the {{immediate}} pressing of red skin grapes without any <b>maceration</b> time. Despite the name vin gris, the resulting juice is actually not grey but rather a very pale pink that is usually much lighter than traditionally made rosés using the limited <b>maceration</b> and saignée methods. Under French wine laws, wines labelled gris de gris must only be made from lightly tinted grape varieties such as Cinsault, Gamay and Grenache gris. The style is a specialty of the Lorraine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) Côtes de Toul made from Gamay and in Morocco where the orange-pink wine is made from a blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
50|$|Schultze reagent is an {{oxidizing}} mixture {{consisting of}} a saturated aqueous solution of potassium chlorate KClO3 and varying amounts of concentrated nitric acid HNO3. It is commonly used in palynologic <b>macerations.</b> It was invented by Max Schultze. It is used {{to determine whether a}} substance contains cellulose (A complex natural sugar).|$|R
30|$|Wood <b>macerations</b> {{were carried}} out using glacial acetic acid (Panreac) and 30  % {{hydrogen}} peroxide (Scharlau) (1 : 1 ratio), at 60  °C for 48  h. The macerated tissue was washed in running water until free of all acid traces and stained with astra blue for determination of vessel element length and fiber biometry.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{its ability}} to {{dissolve}} (most) oxides and silicates, hydrofluoric acid is useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in acid <b>macerations</b> to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks. [...] Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.|$|R

25|$|After {{harvest the}} grapes are destemmed and crushed {{with a short}} <b>maceration</b> period, often with the must warmed up to aid in {{extraction}} of color and phenolics before the wines are pressed and put into barrel. The wine almost always goes through malolactic fermentation. Some Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil producers with vineyards planted in lighter soils will produce an early maturing wine, with an even shorter <b>maceration</b> period and much less oak aging, that can be released {{as early as the}} summer after vintage while other examples will see 15 to 18 months of aging before being bottled.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{dressing}} in that the limb is unreachable during treatment; the skin under the plaster becomes dry and scaly because the discarded outer skin cells are not washed or brushed off. Also, plaster of Paris casts can result in cutaneous complications including <b>macerations,</b> ulcerations, infections, rashes, itching, burns, and allergic contact dermatitis, which may also be due to the presence of formaldehyde within the plaster bandages. In hot weather, staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles and sweat glands can lead to severe and painful dermatitis.|$|R
50|$|Like other cycads, Zamia integrifolia is poisonous, {{producing}} a toxin {{that affects the}} gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. The toxin can however be removed by careful leaching, and the roots and half-buried stems of this cycad were used by Native American people (notably the Tequesta and Mayaimi Indians, the Seminole Indians and the Maroons) to produce this starch. The root is typically prepared by grinding (macerating) it using a wooden mortar and pestle. The pulp is then saturated in water and drained. The drained fluid is allowed to dry and the resulting yellowish powder {{is used in the}} preparation of various foods. In commercial production, multiple <b>macerations</b> achieved a whiter color.|$|R

25|$|When {{the first}} wine labeled as a rosé was {{produced}} {{is not known}} {{but it is very}} likely that many of the earliest red wines made were closer in appearance to today's rosés than they would be to modern red wines. This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended <b>maceration</b> and harder pressing) were not widely practiced in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, with very little <b>maceration</b> time, by hand, feet or even sack cloth creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{carbonic}} <b>maceration</b> {{is also known}} as whole grape fermentation where instead of yeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of Beaujolais wine and involves whole clusters of grapes being stored in a closed container with the oxygen in the container being replaced with carbon dioxide. Unlike normal fermentation where yeast converts sugar into alcohol, carbonic <b>maceration</b> works by enzymes within the grape breaking down the cellular matter to form ethanol and other chemical properties. The resulting wines are typically soft and fruity.|$|E
25|$|Some winemakers utilize a {{derivative}} of carbonic <b>maceration</b> in which whole clusters {{are placed in}} large open vats allowed to ferment inside the individual grape berries, without the addition of yeast, {{for a few days}} before they are crushed.|$|E
5000|$|Aguardientes {{are strong}} {{alcoholic}} beverages, obtained by fermentation and later distillation of sugared or sweet musts, vegetable <b>macerations,</b> or mixtures of the two. This {{is the most}} generic level; by this definition, aguardientes may be made {{from a number of}} different sources. Fruit-based aguardientes include those made from oranges, grapes, bananas, or medronho ("cane apple"). Grain-based ones may be made from millet, barley, or rice and tuber-based aguardientes from beet, manioc, or potato, and finally what are classed as [...] "true" [...] aguardientes from sugarcane and other sweet canes, including some species of bamboo. Under this definition, many other distinct liquors could be called aguardientes, including vodka, shochu, pisco, and certain forms of hard chicha.|$|R

The treatment of <b>macerations</b> and nail-bed infections should also {{be done in the}} beginning. For increasing of the first web space, lengthening of the thumb can be done. It is suggested that in severe cases an amputation of the index finger should be considered. However, before making this decision, it is important to weigh the potential improvement to be achieved against the possible psychological problems of the child later due to the aesthetics of the hand. Later, the second and/or third interdigital web space should be released.|$|R

25|$|Patients find relief by cooling the skin. All {{patients}} must {{be notified}} to not apply ice directly {{on to the}} skin, since this can cause <b>maceration</b> of the skin, nonhealing ulcers, infection, necrosis, and even amputation in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|From the mid 1990s {{there has}} been a revival of amber wine {{production}} in the Friuli which involves leaving the white wine grapes in extended <b>maceration</b> with their grape skins. The resulting wines have a hint of color pigments that give them an orange hue.|$|E
25|$|The rosé wines {{come from}} the same grape {{varieties}} as the red wines, but have a shorter <b>maceration</b> period and are bottled very much sooner. They have aromas of small red fruits, and should be served at between 10nbsp&°C and 12nbsp&°C. They complement starters and grilled meats.|$|E
40|$|Sections and <b>macerations</b> {{of roots}} and stems of Orchidantha maxillarioides (Ridl.) K. Schum. (Lowiaceae) were {{examined}} with a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Vessels with long scalariform perforation plates occur in both roots and rhizome; perforation plates have more pit membrane remnants in rhizomes. At least a few tracheids are present. The degree of perforation plate specialization correlates with the moist forest understory habit of Orchidantha, and {{is similar to that}} in primitive families of monocotyledons that occupy marshy habitats. Vessel data suggest a primitive position for Lowiaceae within Zingiberales in accordance with recent phylogenies of monocotyledons, but recent molecular data point to a position more nearly terminal in the clade; this situation needs resolution. Raphides are figured with SEM, as are starch grains with rounded outlines, the shape of the latter newly reported for Lowiaceae...|$|R
40|$|Vessel {{elements}} from <b>macerations</b> of roots and stems of Hanguana malayana were studied with {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Vessel elements are present in both stems and roots. The vessel elements of roots are slightly more specialized than those of stems in having greater differentiation of perforation plates from lateral wall areas. Long areas of transition between lateral wall areas and perforation plates, consisting of 10 or more pits (arguably perforations) with porose membranes or threadlike pit membrane remnants, characterize vessel elements of both stems and roots of Hanguana. Tracheids may be present, but cannot be identified with certainty. The vessel elements of Hanguana are like those of Acorus (Acoraceae) in primitiveness and {{are among the most}} primitive recorded for monocotyledons. These facts are consistent with placement of Hanguana in a monogeneric family, rather than in Flagellariaceae or any other family of monocotyledons...|$|R
