25|$|Tottenham Yard {{was opened}} in the western suburb of Tottenham from the 1920s {{as part of a}} project to improve freight {{movement}} in Victoria. The majority of freight traffic in the state was from the north or western areas, and was being remarshalled into trains at Melbourne Yard. This caused inefficiencies with the large number of trains needing to enter the Melbourne city, so the yard was opened for the <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> before they were sent to Melbourne Yard.|$|E
50|$|The {{station area}} was rarely used for passengers, being {{so close to}} Crown Street station, but {{was used for the}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> and the {{coupling}} and uncoupling of locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Immediately to {{the east}} of the {{passenger}} station there is a marshalling yard where there are numerous tracks for the marshalling of freight trains. The <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> is facilitated by a hump.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{problem was}} the <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> {{portions}} at Waverley, and passing the trains over the double track {{either side of the}} station. At that time many long distance trains combined and divided, giving through carriages from many remote places which had to be exchanged to other trains. Moreover even local trains conveyed individual vehicles, especially luggage and perishable vans, that had to be transferred to long-distance trains.|$|R
50|$|The tracks {{used for}} freight traffic were greatly scaled back between 1996 and 2005. After that {{the yard was}} only used for the <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>trains.</b>|$|R

50|$|Leipzig-Wahren {{station is}} a {{station in the}} Leipzig suburb of Wahren in the German state of Saxony. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, a large freight yard was developed at it. Until the end of <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> on 31 December 1994, the Leipzig-Wahren freight yard was along with Engelsdorf (b Leipzig) one of the two major marshalling yards in the Leipzig rail node.|$|E
50|$|To {{simplify the}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> and reduce their overall length, the {{original}} four-wheeled stock was close coupled in pairs from 1887 onwards. This involved removing the chopper couplers {{from one end}} of each vehicle and replacing them with conventional side buffers on one carriage and rubbing plates on the other. A link and pin coupling then joined the inner ends of the carriages whilst conventional chopper couplings were retained on the outer ends of the each pair.|$|E

50|$|Often a Chief Track Marshal's {{responsibilities}} {{will include}} the supervision and briefing <b>of</b> <b>marshals</b> for all daily activities, allocation of day-to-day marshaling duties; provision <b>of</b> <b>marshal's</b> vehicles, <b>training</b> <b>of</b> all <b>marshals</b> for incident handling, flag signalling, fire fighting, communications and basic track first aid as well as monitoring of health and safety on site {{to ensure the safety}} of all guests and personnel off-track. During the race the Chief Track Marshal's role is running the radio “network” and communication with all other track marshals as “net control”.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, {{as a first}} measure <b>of</b> relief, the <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>trains</b> was {{relocated}} to a makeshift yard {{to the east of}} the station, on an open field known as [...] "auf dem Wolf". At around that time, discussions began with the aim of lowering the tracks and replacing the troublesome urban level crossings on the Elsässerbahn and at the Centralbahnhof. In 1874, provisional timber pedestrian bridges had already been built at Margarethenstrasse und Heumattstrasse; they were later replaced by iron structures. From 1879, the Pfeffingerstrasse passed underneath the station in a tunnel near the present location of the Peter Merian Bridge.|$|R

5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to <b>marshal</b> <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|R
50|$|By 1970, the Ec {{locomotives}} {{had reached}} the end of their working lives and it was decided that the cost of continuing to maintain the sub-station at Woolston and overhauling the existing locomotives or replacing them could not be justified. Another factor against the electrification was the operational cost <b>of</b> <b>marshalling</b> <b>trains</b> at Christchurch and Lyttelton to add or remove the electric locomotives from trains for just a 10 km journey. It was decided to dieselise the line, and accordingly the last electric train ran on Friday, 18 September 1970. All electrical infrastructure on the line was subsequently removed.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 1907, the Kempten bypass railway was opened, which {{relieved}} {{the terminal}} station of through traffic, especially freight trains. The bypass connected the lines from Neu-Ulm, Kaufbeuren and Pfronten {{directly to the}} Allgäu Railway to Immenstadt. A new bridge over the Iller was erected for the bypass; it is an arched bridge made of tamped concrete with a length of 155 metres and a main vault with a clearance of 64.5 metres, crossing the river at a height of 33 metres. North {{the bridge of the}} bypass line two more tamped concrete bridges were built on the access line to the terminal station. The wood truss bridge formerly used by the line was converted into a road bridge. A marshalling yard was built on the bypass line for the <b>marshalling</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>trains</b> from Bavaria and neighbouring countries in the northeast towards Lake Constance, Switzerland and south western Europe; it had a capacity of 1,200 wagons per day. At the same time the engine depot was moved about two kilometres from the terminal station to the south <b>of</b> the <b>marshalling</b> yard. In 1933, the yard lost its national significance, because long-distance freight trains ran over the newly electrified Ulm-Augsburg line and avoided the hilly Allgäu line.|$|R

40|$|The {{railway freight}} {{terminals}} {{play a key}} role within the multimodal logistic chain. Therefore, the transit time through these terminals represents one of the most relevant terminal performances {{and at the same time}} a key component of the freight transport generalised cost, so that its quantitative analysis is a strategic activity, both in the terminal planning and in the logistic chain organisation. The transit time is composed by deterministic and stochastic components, which increases significantly the problem complexity. In a general framework the freight terminals to be considered are: a) 	land freight interchanges: interchange between trains and trucks; b) 	<b>marshalling</b> yards: modification <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> composition within the railway system; c) 	railway maritime terminals: interchange between ships and trains. In order to investigate the sensitivity of the transit time for different terminal typology the model has been applied to some case studie...|$|R
