40|$|Background—Ileal motor {{patterns}} are {{adapted to the}} propulsion of viscous meal residue, such as bran, which accumulates in the distal ileum postprandially.  Aims—To {{examine the effects of}} <b>a</b> second liquid/solid <b>meal</b> on ileal emptying.  Subjects and methods—Eleven healthy fasting subjects consumed a 1. 47 MJ pancake containing 15 g bran and 5 MBq Technetium- 99 m labelled amberlite resin (<b>meal</b> <b>A).</b> Gastric emptying and transit through the left upper quadrant (proximal) and right lower quadrant (distal) small bowel regions and colon were assessed scintigraphically. Transit was compared with and without a second Indium- 111 liquid/solid DTPA labelled 2. 28 MJ meal (B) given three hours after the first meal.  Results—Gastric emptying of <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> was slower than meal B (the time for 50 % of the activity to leave the stomach (T 50) being 113 (11) minutes versus 48 (3) minutes respectively, p< 0. 01, n= 11). Both meals passed rapidly through the proximal small bowel (T 50 <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> = 57 (14) minutes versus T 50 meal B = 42 (11) minutes). Transit of <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> through the distal small bowel was much slower (T 50 more than 390 minutes versus 176 (29) minutes for meal B, p< 0. 01), resulting in meal B overtaking <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> and entering the colon earlier. Ingestion of the second meal (B) resulted in significantly less <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> marker entering the colon (5 (3) %) at 11 hours than when <b>meal</b> <b>A</b> was taken alone (18 (4) %) (p< 0. 05, n= 8).  Conclusions—The distal small bowel selectively retains bran, allowing liquid phase markers through to the colon. Consuming <b>a</b> second liquid/solid <b>meal</b> does not stimulate ileal transit of bran which seems to be propelled quicker by fasting motor patterns. ...|$|R

To prevent extra food, jewelry, diaries, and other valuables from being confiscated, items were hidden in clothing or latrines, or were buried before scheduled inspections. Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds of lives.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. The North Korea Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to completely halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. At best there were rations for only one or two <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
