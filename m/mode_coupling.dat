50|$|The {{operation}} of the hybrid plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of <b>mode</b> <b>coupling.</b> The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a silicon nanowire placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports dielectric waveguide mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the dielectric waveguide mode supported by the silicon nanowire couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As {{a result of this}} <b>mode</b> <b>coupling,</b> light becomes highly confined in the region between the metal and the high index region (silicon nanowire).|$|E

Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of multimode fiber bandwidth measurements.|$|E
30|$|Generally speaking, {{owing to}} the GRI effect, if the GRI profile is more linear, the {{reflection}} caused by refractive index mismatch will become lower. According to Figure  3, the GRI profile is most linear when OT[*]=[*] 1.6, {{which leads to the}} least reflection caused by refractive index mismatch. However, as shown in Figure  7, the averaged reflectance reaches to minimum when OT[*]=[*] 2, which seems contradictory with the existing GRI effect. The reason leading to this phenomenon is that the dominated antireflection mechanisms in the shorter wavelength region (300 - 500  nm) are waveguide <b>modes</b> <b>coupling</b> and multiple scattering. With the increases of OT, the top diameters of the NCs will be enlarged as depicted in Figure  2, which will enhance the guide <b>modes</b> <b>coupling</b> [25, 29] in the top NCs. Therefore, the averaged reflectance of the NCs with OT[*]=[*] 2 is lower than that of NCs with OT[*]=[*] 1.6. However, when OT changes from 2 to 3, the guide <b>modes</b> <b>coupling</b> will be further enhanced in theory, but the GRI profile deviates greatly from linear status. Consequently, the waveguide <b>modes</b> <b>coupling</b> cannot compensate the reflection caused by refractive index mismatch; thus, the averaged reflectance increases to a little larger value as shown in Figure  7.|$|R

50|$|Resistive instabilities are {{an issue}} for all {{magnetic}} configurations, since the onset can occur at beta values well below the ideal limit. The stability of neoclassical tearing modes (NTM) is a key issue for magnetic configurations with a strong bootstrap current. The NTM is a metastable mode; in certain plasma configurations, a sufficiently large deformation of the bootstrap current produced by a “seed island” {{can contribute to the}} growth of the island. The NTM is already an important performance-limiting factor in many tokamak experiments, leading to degraded confinement or disruption. Although the basic mechanism is well established, the capability to predict the onset in present and future devices requires better understanding of the damping mechanisms which determine the threshold island size, and of the <b>mode</b> <b>coupling</b> by which other instabilities (such as sawteeth in tokamaks) can generate seed islands. Resistive Ballooning Mode, similar to ideal ballooning, but with finite resistivity taken into consideration, provides another example of a resistive instability.|$|E
5000|$|OAM {{multiplexing}} can not {{be implemented}} in the existing long-haul optical fiber systems, since these systems are based on single-mode fibers, which inherently do not support OAM states of light. Instead, few-mode or multi-mode fibers need to be used. Additional problem for OAM multiplexing implementation {{is caused by the}} <b>mode</b> <b>coupling</b> that is present in conventional fibers, which cause changes in the spin angular momentum of modes under normal conditions and changes in orbital angular momentum when fibers are bent or stressed. Because of this mode instability, direct-detection OAM multiplexing has not yet been realized in long-haul communications. In 2012, transmission of OAM states with 97% purity after 20 meters over special fibers was demonstrated by researchers at Boston University. [...] Later experiments have shown stable propagation of these modes over distances of 50 meters, and further improvements of this distance are the subject of ongoing work.

50|$|The main {{theoretical}} uncertainties in {{the interpretation}} of BAO measurements are the effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and of scale-dependent bias between galaxies and dark matter. Non-linear evolution erases the acoustic oscillations on small scales, while both non-linear <b>mode</b> <b>coupling</b> and scale-dependent bias can shift the positions of the BAO features. Scale-dependent bias on large scales is potentially more of a concern for interpreting the broad-band power spectrum shape than for the BAO signal. Simulations that will become available over the next few years, should enable us to calculate the corrections due to non-linearity and scale-dependent bias to sufficient accuracy that the remaining systematic uncertainty will be small compared to the DES statistical errors on large scales. In addition, since the bispectrum(The Fourier transform of the second-order cumulant used to search for nonlinear interactions) responds to non-linearity and bias differently from the power spectrum, measurement of the angular bispectrum shape in DES will provide a cross-check on these effects, constrain this scale-dependence and determine the efficacy and robustness of including the broad-band shape in constraining dark energy.|$|E
50|$|The grating bars can be {{considered}} as merely a periodic array of waveguides with wave being guided along the grating thickness direction. Upon plane wave incidence, depending on wavelength and grating dimensions, only a few waveguide-array modes are excited. Due to a large index contrast and near-wavelength dimensions, there exists a wide wavelength range where only two waveguide-array modes have real propagation constants in the z direction and, hence, carry energy. The two waveguide-array modes then depart from the grating input plane and propagate downward to the grating exiting plane, and then reflect back up. After propagating through the grating thickness, each propagating mode accumulates a different phase. At the exiting plane, owing to a strong mismatch with the exiting plane wave, the waveguide modes not only reflect back to themselves but also couple into each other. As the modes propagate and return to the input plane, similar <b>mode</b> <b>coupling</b> occurs. Following the modes through one round trip, the reflectivity solution can be attained. The two modes interfere at the input and exiting plane of the high contrast grating, leading to various distinct properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the RTI follows four main stages. [...] In the first stage, the perturbation amplitudes are small when compared to their wavelengths, the equations of motion can be linearized, resulting in exponential instability growth. In the early portion of this stage, a sinusoidal initial perturbation retains its sinusoidal shape. However, {{after the end of}} this first stage, when non-linear effects begin to appear, one observes the beginnings of the formation of the ubiquitous mushroom-shaped spikes (fluid structures of heavy fluid growing into light fluid) and bubbles (fluid structures of light fluid growing into heavy fluid). The growth of the mushroom structures continues in the second stage and can be modeled using buoyancy drag models, resulting in a growth rate that is approximately constant in time. At this point, nonlinear terms in the equations of motion can no longer be ignored. The spikes and bubbles then begin to interact with one another in the third stage. Bubble merging takes place, where the nonlinear interaction of <b>mode</b> <b>coupling</b> acts to combine smaller spikes and bubbles to produce larger ones. Also, bubble competition takes places, where spikes and bubbles of smaller wavelength that have become saturated are enveloped by larger ones that have not yet saturated. This eventually develops into a region of turbulent mixing,which is the fourth and final stage in the evolution. It is generally assumed that the mixing region that finally develops is self-similar and turbulent, provided that the Reynolds number is sufficiently large.|$|E
