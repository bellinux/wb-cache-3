Regarding the former, {{it does not make}} a crucial difference how the land is utilised specifically: pasture and meadow; arable land or plantation or certified organic farmland, use not known. For an illustration, let us consider that in 2005, almost half of organic farmlands in the world were located in Australia, amounting to over 31 million hectares. Most of this area is pastoral land for low intensity grazing in Australia. Therefore, one organic hectare in Australia is not directly equivalent to one organic hectare in Denmark, for example, due to its level of productivity.

Mukdoni {{summed up}} the {{ambivalent}} feelings Russian Jewish intellectuals had about the influx of American plays and players onto their soil {{on the eve of}} the war: 'The American repertoire—be it the good or bad one—and the American actors—be they the good or bad ones—made us realize that the Yiddish theatre is really in America and that here in Poland and Russia the Yiddish theatre lives off the fallen crumbs that it collects under the rich American table.'"Mukdoyni was certainly correct in realizing that the center of Yiddish theatrical production was in New York, and that Poland was turning into its cultural colony. This theatrical expansion eastward, which had begun slowly in the 1890s because of the great need in Eastern Europe to fill the vacuum of repertoire, turned into a conscious American export item during the 1910S. At that time, the immigrant community in New York as a whole, and the Yiddish theatre in particular, had matured, and they were confident enough of their power and unique status to begin to actively seek acknowledgement, accolades, and financial gain beyond the local and regional spheres. The war would only briefly interrupt this emerging trend. What Clara Young was one of the first to discover, actors such as Molly Picon and Ludwig Satz would realize during the interwar period: Poland offered not only a lucrative market for American Yiddish actors, but also an environment where up-and-coming performers could more easily achieve a career breakthrough than in New York. In the early years of immigration, Eastern Europe had served as a necessary recruitment pool to feed the American Yiddish theatre with new stage talent; shortly before World War I, it began to provide new audiences and <b>marketing</b> <b>possibilities</b> for the creative energies that had gathered in New York." ...|$|E
