40|$|Consumer {{trust in}} the food {{industry}} is heavily reliant upon accurate labelling of meat products. As such, methods which can verify whether meat is correctly labelled are of great value to producers, retailers, and consumers. This paper illustrates two approaches to classify between, fresh and frozen thawed, and in a novel manner <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed, as well as fresh <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> beef using the 500 - 1010 nm waveband, captured using hyperspectral imaging, and CIELAB measurements. The results show successful classification based upon CIELAB between 1) fresh and frozen-thawed (CCR = 0. 93), and 2) fresh <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> (CCR = 0. 92). With successful classification between <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed beef using the entire spectral range (CCR = 1. 00). The performance of reduced spectral models is also investigated. Overall {{it was found that}} CIELAB co-ordinates can be used for successful classification for all comparisons except between <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed. Biochemical <b>and</b> physical changes of the meat are thoroughly discussed for each condition...|$|R

Vitelline folicules contain vitelline cells at various stages of development: immature, <b>maturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> cells. <b>Maturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> vitellocytes contain vitelline material {{in the form of}} single small shell globules that gradually fuse and give rise to the large shell globule clusters. Glycogen is present in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of the mature vitellocytes...|$|R

5|$|Alex O'Loughlin portrays Mick St. John, {{a private}} {{investigator}} who {{was turned into a}} vampire on the night of his wedding by his bride, Coraline. Mick is 85 years old, and unlike other vampires, he has standards and does not hunt women, children, or innocents. Although he realizes that he has feelings for Beth, he is reluctant to continue a romantic relationship with her, knowing that being a vampire would hinder any sort of normal life. He is shown to be unusually <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> physically strong for a vampire of his age.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
40|$|Results {{from three}} trials showed the {{diversity}} among forage sorghum hybrids for both agronomic and nutritive characteristics.

5|$|Hiroyuki Okiura, the {{character}} designer and key animation supervisor, designed a more <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> serious Motoko than Masamune Shirow's original portrayal of {{the character}} in the manga. Okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match Motoko's mental age, instead of the youthful twenty-something appearance in the manga. Motoko's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles <b>mature,</b> <b>and</b> about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E

5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E
5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more <b>mature</b> <b>and</b> raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the effects of {{cryoprotectant}} and Open Pulled Straw (OPS) vitrification on ultrastructural changes in bovine oocytes. In experiment 1, the cryoprotectant exposure was analyzed by distributing immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in groups: control immature, immature and exposed to one vitrification solution (IVS 1), immatured and exposed to two vitrification solutions (IVS 1 - 2), <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> exposed to one vitrification solution (MVS 1), <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> exposed to two vitrification solutions (MVS 1 - 2), control matured, IVS 1 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 post IVM) and IVS 1 - 2 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 - 2 post IVM). In experiment 2, immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs were distributed in: control and vitrified by OPS using VS 1 - 2. Sample COCs from both experiments were evaluated for mitochondrial distribution, nuclear lamins (immature COCs) <b>and</b> meiotic spindle (<b>matured</b> COCs). In both experiments, COCs were in vitro <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> fertilized. In experiment I, nuclear lamins in immature COCs exhibited higher proportion of structures with irregular shape when treated with VS 1 and VS 1 - 2. Immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 - 2, <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 had lower (P 0. 05). The cleavage rate was higher (P < 0. 05) in matured vitrified than immature vitrified group (19 % vs. 8 %). In conclusion, immature COCs were more tolerant to cryoprotectant exposure. However, matured oocytes showed better embryo development (cleavage) after vitrification...|$|R
