5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski County district court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
5|$|After the {{garrison}} of Nevesinje had been relieved, Laxa directed his main effort towards the Gacko and Avtovac districts. Sensitive {{to the fact}} that the Italians had not respected the territorial borders of the NDH when they sent their column to Gacko, he considered it very important that Croatian military and political prestige be restored, otherwise the Italians <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> to remain in the area rather than withdraw to their garrison near the Adriatic coast. He planned to follow this consolidation by clearing the border areas with Montenegro then clearing the hinterland of any remaining rebels. For this last task he intended to deploy a yet-to-be-formed special unit to be led by Lieutenant Colonel Josip Metzger. The task of re-asserting NDH authority in the Gacko and Avtovac districts was allocated to Prohaska's group, consisting of the 6th Battalion, one company of the 18th Battalion, two companies of the 17th Battalion, and the recently arrived 15th and 21st Battalions, which were to be sent to Nevesinje from Mostar. Prohaska was to act in concert with the 11th Battalion who were already in the vicinity of Plužine, just to the north of the Nevesinje–Gacko road. In preparation, the 15th Battalion was trucked to Nevesinje, and a company of the 17th Battalion conducted a coordinated attack with the 11th Battalion on rebel positions near Kifino Selo. This attack was defeated by the rebels, and a battalion commander was killed.|$|E

500|$|Police visited Hindley, {{then being}} held in Cookham Wood, Kent, {{a few days after}} she had {{received}} the letter, and although she refused to admit any involvement in the killings, she agreed to help by looking at photographs and maps to try to identify spots that she had visited with Brady. She showed particular interest in photographs of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said {{that it was impossible to}} be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. The security considerations for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was that, knowing of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> to co-operate with the police, and wanted to make certain that she, and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E

On December 15, 1986, Shelley Long decided to leave Cheers as the regular character Diane Chambers, even though she and Ted [...] " [...] done some really terrific work at Cheers", for her movie career and family, while Ted Danson signed a contract for the next season (19871988), which led producers, the Charles brothers and Burrows, to separate Sam and Diane. An idea to keep Sam in and write Diane out without risk of ruining the quality and losing viewers had been developed. Before Diane was written out by having her leave Boston for a writing career, some ideas were attempted and discarded, like Sam and Diane's child in the next season, as Sam {{would have been a}} single father, and another ideal man for Diane. Three endings were filmed, in part to attempt to keep the actual one a secret, and because it was possible that Long <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> to stay: 1) Sam and Diane become married; 2) Diane accepts an offer to finish a novel; 3) not revealed by the producers. The alternate ending in which Sam and Diane get married aired on May 27, 1998 as part of a 90-minute Fox special produced by the Paley Center called Behind the Laughs: The Untold Stories of Television's Favorite Comedies: A Museum of Television and Radio Special.|$|E

Anárion died first before Sauron broke the siege and the mighty king of the Elves, Gil-galad challenges Sauron to a duel, and is slain in combat. Finally Elendil fights Sauron, and though he is mortally wounded he manages to overcome Sauron before he dies. Isildur, Elendil's son, approaches Sauron's body and cuts off his finger with the One Ring, breaking Sauron's power and causing his spirit to depart from his body.

2500|$|Nietzsche {{elaborated}} {{these ideas}} {{in his book}} On the Genealogy of Morality, in which he also introduced the key concept of ressentiment {{as the basis for}} the slave morality. [...] Nietzsche's primarily negative assessment of the ethical and moralistic teachings of Christianity followed from his earlier considerations of the questions of God and morality in the works The Gay Science and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. These considerations led Nietzsche to the idea of eternal recurrence. Nietzsche primarily meant that, for all practical purposes, his contemporaries lived as if God were dead, though they had not yet recognized it. Nietzsche believed this [...] "death" [...] had already started to undermine the foundations of morality and would lead to moral relativism and moral nihilism. As a response to the dangers of these trends he believed in re-evaluating the foundations of morality to better understand the origins and motives underlying them, so that individuals <b>might</b> <b>decide</b> for themselves whether to regard a moral value as born of an outdated or misguided cultural imposition or as something they wish to hold true.|$|E
