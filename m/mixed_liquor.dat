25|$|The {{combination}} of wastewater and biological mass is {{commonly known as}} <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor.</b> In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatant is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge, is returned {{to the head of the}} aeration system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called return activated sludge (R.A.S.).|$|E

2500|$|... the {{traditional}} method {{which was once}} called méthode champenoise consists of vinifying white or rosé wine as for a still wine. A liqueur de tirage (sugar) is then added to the wine and bottled. A second fermentation then occurs in the bottle from yeast and the sugar from the liqueur de tirage. The wine is then [...] dégorgé or disgorged and a liqueur de dosage or <b>mix</b> (<b>liquor</b> more or less sweet depending on the desired final product: brut, demi-sec, or doux).|$|R
25|$|Treatment of {{nitrogenous}} matter or phosphate involves additional steps {{where the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> {{is left in}} anoxic condition (meaning {{that there is no}} residual dissolved oxygen).|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} control methods, {{the amount of}} settled solids in the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> can be varied by wasting {{activated}} sludge (WAS) or returning activated sludge (RAS).|$|E
25|$|The space {{required}} for a sewage treatment plant can be reduced by using a membrane bioreactor to remove some wastewater from the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> prior to treatment. This results in a more concentrated waste product that can then be treated using the activated sludge process.|$|E
50|$|A lemon or lime peel is {{hollowed}} out and floated inside a bowl or oversized snifter of <b>mixed</b> <b>liquors</b> and fruit juices. Overproof rum is {{poured into the}} hollowed shell and set alight. A small, fireproof dish of similar proportions may be used instead of a citrus peel. Placing a sugar cube inside the shell helps in two ways. First, it acts as a wick to present a better flame, and secondly, it adds weight to the shell and helps prevent tipping. The caramelized sugar cube is edible {{if it is not}} burned too badly.|$|R

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{effort to}} selectively detect {{the presence of}} a nitrifying bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, successfully demonstrated the fundamental utility of an enzyme-based immunoassay protocol. The applied polyclonal antibody test seemingly offered a marked improvement over the available analytical options, including plating, activity, and fluorescence immunoassay techniques. Following an initial purification step to enhance overall specificity, this procedure had an apparent lower limit of detection of ∼ 5 × 106 cells per ml. Tests conducted with activated sludge samples exhibited a distinct difference between nitrifying and nonnitrifying <b>mixed</b> <b>liquors,</b> although the highest Nitrosomonas levels observed (i. e., at 1 to 2 % of the overall viable cell density) were relatively close to the latter detection boundary...|$|R
25|$|In some areas, {{where more}} land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches {{with one or}} more {{horizontal}} aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> around the ditch and provide aeration. These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).|$|E
25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
2500|$|Many sewage {{treatment}} plants use axial flow pumps to transfer nitrified <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. [...] These pumps are {{often referred to}} as internal <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> recycle pumps (IMLR pumps). The raw sewage, the RAS, and the nitrified <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> are mixed by submersible mixers in the anoxic zones in order to achieve denitrification.|$|E
50|$|Jungle {{juice is}} the name given to an improvised <b>mix</b> of <b>liquor</b> that is usually served for group consumption. There are countless recipes and even {{websites}} devoted solely to jungle juice. The term has also been used for similar less-than-reputable alcoholic concoctions.|$|R

60|$|On this hint the old {{fisherman}} {{raised the}} bowl {{a second time}} to his lips, and renewed the agreeable duty of letting its contents flow down his throat, in a pleasant stream. This time, he took aim at a gull that was sailing over his head, only relinquishing the draught as the bird settled into the water. The 'general' was more particular; for selecting a stationary object, {{in the top of}} an oak, that grew on the mountain near him, he studied it with an admirable abstruseness of attention, until the last drop was drained. As soon as this startling fact was mentioned, however, both the convives set about repairing the accident, by squeezing lemons, sweetening water, and <b>mixing</b> <b>liquors,</b> secundem artem. At the same time, each lighted a cigar, and the conversation, for some time, was carried on between their teeth.|$|R
2500|$|The F/M is {{the ratio}} of food fed to the {{microorganisms}} each day to the mass of microorganisms held under aeration. Specifically, it {{is the amount of}} BOD fed to the aerator (lbs/day) divided by the amount (lbs) of <b>Mixed</b> <b>Liquor</b> Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS) under aeration. Note: [...] Some references use MLSS (<b>Mixed</b> <b>Liquor</b> Suspended Solids) for expedience, but MLVSS is considered more accurate for the measure of microorganisms. Again, due to expedience, COD is generally used, in lieu of BOD, as BOD takes five days for results.|$|E
2500|$|Many sewage {{treatment}} plants use centrifugal pumps {{to transfer the}} nitrified <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. [...] These pumps are {{often referred to as}} Internal <b>Mixed</b> <b>Liquor</b> Recycle (IMLR) pumps. [...] IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q.) [...] This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. [...] (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF.) [...] At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. [...] These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{modifications}} to the MLE were to come: [...] Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. [...] Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. [...] Even newer improvements, such as Anammox Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria {{through the use of}} substrate added to the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™. The bacteria Brocadia anammoxidans can remove ammonium from waste water [...] through anaerobic oxidation of ammonium to hydrazine, a form of rocket fuel.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Modified Ludzak-Ettinger Process" [...] (MLE) [...] is an {{improvement}} {{on the original}} concept, for it recycles <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor</b> from the discharge end of the aeration tank {{to the head of}} the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. [...] In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Denitrification {{requires}} anoxic {{conditions to}} encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) {{can do the job}} the most easily. Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an electron donor is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), sulfide, or an added donor like methanol. [...] The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated <b>mixed</b> <b>liquor,</b> return activated sludge , and raw influent) e.g. by using submersible mixers in order to achieve the desired denitrification.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the protozoan fauna and abundance in the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquors</b> of aeration tanks of the three municipal wastewater treatment plants located in Fort Beaufort, Dimbaza and East London in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and their implication to the production of effluents of good quality. The samples were collected between September and December 2005 and protozoa species were identified by direct microscopic observations at x 400 magnification by comparison with existing protozoa gallery collections. A total of 68 protozoan genera made up of 44 ciliates, 16 flagellates and 8 others were identified in wastewater treatment plants. Although in all aerobic zones the average density of ciliates was 10 4 cells mL - 1, which indicated that these plants were able to produce clear effluent of good quality, a better performance was found in Dimbaza and East London, which had total protozoan genera of 27 and 26, respectively...|$|R
