25|$|Research {{on animals}} finds that {{environmental}} enrichment could aid {{the treatment and}} recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including Alzheimer's disease and those connected to aging, whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>this</b> research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of cognitive reserve, the brain's resilience {{to the effects of}} conditions such as aging and dementia.|$|E

25|$|Approximations for {{the number}} of fixed polyominoes and free polyominoes are related in a simple way. A free polyomino with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) {{corresponds}} to 8 distinct fixed polyominoes, and for large n, most n-ominoes have no symmetries. Therefore, the number of fixed n-ominoes is approximately 8 times the number of free n-ominoes. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>this</b> approximation is exponentially more accurate as n increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{glass ceiling}} metaphor {{has often been}} used to {{describe}} invisible barriers ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling"). These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>this</b> effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions and puts them at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.|$|E
