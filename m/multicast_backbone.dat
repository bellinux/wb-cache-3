40|$|Abstract — To support {{large-scale}} Internet-based {{broadcast of}} live streaming video efficiently in content delivery networks (CDNs), {{it is essential}} to implement a cost-effective overlay multicast mechanism by exploiting peer-to-peer distribution capabilities among end hosts. This way, the access bandwidth demand on CDN servers in the <b>multicast</b> overlay <b>backbone</b> can be largely reduced. Such a streaming infrastructure gives rise to an interesting host-aware routing problem (HARP). For a live streaming video broadcast event, each participating CDN server is made aware of the largest delay from it to end hosts within its service area. The problem is to optimize routing among CDN servers in the <b>multicast</b> overlay <b>backbone</b> such that the de facto maximal end-to-end latency from the origin server to all end hosts is minimized subject to access bandwidth constraints on CDN servers. In this paper, we frame HARP as a constrained spanning tree problem which is shown to be NP-hard. We present a distributed algorithm for HARP. Simulation experiments confirm that our proposed algorithm converges to good quality solutions that are close to the optimum. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Face is a {{well-known}} localized routing protocol for ad hoc and sensor networks which guarantees delivery of the message {{as long as a}} path exists between the source and the des-tination. This is achieved by employing a left/right hand rule to route the message along the faces of a planar topology. Although face was developed for the unicast case, it has recently been used in combination with multicasting protocols, where there are multiple destinations. Some of the proposed solutions handle each destination separately and lead thus to increased energy consumption. Extensions of face recovery to the multicast case described so far are either limited to certain planar graphs or do not provide delivery guarantees. A recently described scheme employs multicast face recovery based on a so called <b>multicast</b> <b>backbone.</b> A <b>multicast</b> <b>backbone</b> is a Euclidean spanning tree which contains at least the source and the destination nodes. The idea of backbone assisted routing it to follow the edges of the backbone in order to deliver a multicast message to all spanned destination nodes. The existing backbone face routing scheme is however limited to a certain planar graph type and a certain backbone construction. One of the key aspects of the multicast face algorithm MFACE we propose in this work is that it may be applied on top of any planar topology. Moreover, our solution may be used as a generic framework since it is able to work with any arbitrary <b>multicast</b> <b>backbone.</b> In MFACE, any edge of the backbone originated at the source node will generate a new copy of the message which will be routed toward the set of destination nodes spanned by the corresponding edge. Whenever the message arrives at a face edge intersected by a backbone edge different from the initial edge, the message is split into two copies, both handling a disjoint subset of the multicast destinations which are defined by splitting the <b>multicast</b> <b>backbone</b> at that intersection point.

40|$|We {{present a}} minimum {{spanning}} tree based energy aware multicast protocol (MSTEAM), which is a localized geographic multicast routing scheme designed for ad hoc and sensor networks. It uses locally-built {{minimum spanning tree}}s (MST) as an efficient approximation of the optimal <b>multicasting</b> <b>backbone.</b> Using a MST is highly relevant {{in the context of}} dynamic wireless networks since its computation has a low time complexity (O(n log n)). Moreover, our protocol is fully localized and requires nodes to gather information only on 1 -hop neighbors, which is common assumption in existing work. In MSTEAM, a message split occurs when the MST over the current node and the set of destinations has multiple edges originated at the current node. Destinations spanned by each of these edges are grouped together, and for each of these subsets the best neighbor is selected as the next hop. This selection is based on a cost over progress metric, where the progress is approximated by subtracting the weight of the MST over a given neighbor and the subset of destinations to the weight of the MST over the current node and the subset of destinations. Since such greedy localized scheme may lead the message to a void area (i. e., there is no neighbor providing positive progress toward the destinations), we also propose a completely new multicast generalization of the well-know face recovery mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis proving that MSTEAM is loop-free and always achieves delivery of the multicast message, as long as a path exists between the source node and the destinations. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSTEAM is highly energy-efficient, outperforms the best existing localized multicast scheme and is almost as efficient as a centralized scheme in high densities...|$|R

This interest has strengthened {{with the introduction of}} the MBone (the Internet <b>multicasting</b> <b>backbone)</b> and with the range of services made possible by ATM and those envisaged for Broadband ISDN. This thesis discusses the potential {{for a wide variety of}} multi-party applications. It examines their detailed requirements and the support mechanisms needed to meet these requirements. The work is presented as a dissertation and a collection of work published over a period of about ten years and as such draws together work on multi-party communication undertaken by the author and postgraduate students under her supervision. The major contribution of the thesis and the most recent work concerns multicast routing strategies capable of supporting high-bandwidth delay sensitive applications. A new heuristic is introduced which is shown to offer efficient routing solutions whilst ensuring that delays to each participant are kept within a bound. The heuristic is reasonably simple and is shown to perform well under a variety of conditions.

Architectural frameworks are presented which extend existing protocol reference models to offer multicast support mechanisms at appropriate hierarchical levels with a view to flexible yet efficient use of the network. One important support mechanism is group management and a system developed in the context of an integrated services network is described.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{opportunistic}} multicast protocol to improve multicast throughput in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN). It builds upon opportunistic routing (OR) strategies {{that have been}} designed to improve unicast throughput in wireless networks. The key concept in our multicast protocol is a tree backbone. Our tree backbone protocol represents a tradeoff between traditional structured multicast protocols where a complete multicast tree is constructed and unstructured protocols where multicast is treated as a collection of unicasts. Tree backbone selects multiple nodes as intermediate nodes. Each pair of upstream and downstream nodes may be multiple hops away, and packet delivery between them takes advantage of OR. For single-rate WMNs, we show that constructing an efficient tree backbone that minimizes the number of transmissions is NP-hard, and we devise one effective heuristic algorithm for it. For multi-rate WMNs, we investigate the inherent rate-distance tradeoff and propose a Euclidean opportunistic multicast protocol by devising a Euclidean tree backbone as well as an efficient rate selection scheme to minimize the number of transmissions. In our simulations, our tree <b>backbone</b> <b>multicast</b> protocols outperform both the completely structured traditional multicast protocols and the completely unstructured unicast-based protocols augmented with OR in both throughput and delay...|$|R

Due to the mobility of devices, the topology of the network may change rapidly and unpredictably over time, making multicast routing and route maintenance a very crucial task. Plenty of protocols have been proposed for the construction of virtual backbone, but they have limitations in terms of control overhead, delay, throughput, energy consumption and mobility. As a part of <b>multicast</b> routing, virtual <b>backbone</b> construction has been proposed and classified into three different techniques: tree-based virtual backbone, cluster-based virtual backbone and dominating set-based virtual backbone.

While Virtual <b>Multicast</b> <b>Backbone</b> (VMB) structure are commonly used in current multicast protocols, this paper focuses {{on the construction of}} the optimal VMB with the fewest forwarding nodes to decrease overhead and cost, due to the scarce resource in ad hoc networks. Instead of conventional Steiner tree model, the optimal shared VMB in ad hoc networks is modeled as Minimum Steiner Dominating Set (MSCDS) in Unit-Disk Graphs (UDG), which is NP-hard. A performance evaluation of flooding for MSCDS is given and a One-hop Algorithm is proposed with an approximation ratio of at most 10. To adapt various network scenarios, this paper further presents a fully distributed d-hop algorithm also with a constant approximation ratio, which organizes multicast nodes to form a hierarchical VMB. Based on the hierarchical structure, this paper proposes some approaches to maintain and update VMB, and gives a security framework to exclude malicious nodes from multicast groups.
