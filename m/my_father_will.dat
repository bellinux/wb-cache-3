25|$|<b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky is the {{eleventh}} studio album by Swans released on September 23, 2010; {{it was their}} first studio recording in 14 years. Swans founder Michael Gira funded the recording of this album by creating the limited-edition album I Am Not Insane and chose several collaborators from previous Swans line-ups {{as well as his}} side project Angels of Light to record and tour for this album. <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky has received positive critical feedback for the return of Swans as well as the rich spiritual themes of the lyrics.|$|E
25|$|Swans {{then went}} {{on a series of}} U.S. and European tour dates, and headlined the Supersonic Festival in Birmingham, England in October 2010. The first post-reformation Swans album, <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, was {{released}} on September 23, 2010, and the band simultaneously embarked on an eighteen-month world tour. The band were chosen by Portishead to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festivals that Portishead curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace, and, in September 2011, in Asbury Park, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> think of it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E

6000|$|Fred. [Aside.] I hope she's safe, {{and then}} this fantastic love of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> make us sport to-momorrow. [...] [Exeunt.|$|R

500|$|Franck's text shows {{elements}} of early Pietism: {{the expression of}} extreme feelings, for example [...] "O seligste Zeiten!" [...] (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a [...] "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to [...] "" [...] (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His [...] temple, more literally: [...] "God wants to prepare [...] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>will</b> love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E
2500|$|<b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky {{is rated}} an 83 with [...] "universal acclaim" [...] by Metacritic. The A.V. Club gave the album an A, calling it [...] "a {{leviathan}} of an album" [...] and {{commenting on the}} similarities and differences that this album has with the rest of Swans' catalogue, saying that it [...] "resembles all of Swans' previous work, yet none of it." [...] BBC Music has declared it [...] "a majestic return and, let us hope, a harbinger of more to come." [...] The Big Takeover has remarked that the album [...] "encompasses all of the original band's many moods." [...] In its December issue, The Wire listed <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky as the third best album of 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, in {{his short}} story [...] "By The Turtles of Tasman", a character, {{defending}} her ne'er-do-well grasshopperish father to her antlike uncle, says: [...] "... {{my father has}} been a king. He has lived .... Have you lived merely to live? Are you afraid to die? I'd rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it, than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet. When you are dust, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> be ashes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A letter, {{attached}} to <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will,</b> answers this question, and tells {{a very sad}} story. In deference to my mother's wishes it was kept strictly a secret from me while <b>my</b> <b>father</b> lived.|$|R
6000|$|... "The first {{claim on}} me? Do you think I'm going to risk being {{cut out of}} <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will?</b> Not for the best woman that ever put on a petticoat!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} of them. In former days, I {{think you were}} told that <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> {{provided}} for <b>my</b> mother and for me. You {{know that we have}} enough to live on?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Gira {{hinted at}} the {{prospect}} of resurrecting the Swans project. Later that year, many of the tracks that would appear on <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Will</b> Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky were released in demo and acoustic form [...] on I Am Not Insane and sold in order to fund the recording process for this album. Gira handmade 1,000 copies of that album to fund the new Swans recordings. In January 2010, Gira amended the band's Facebook and MySpace to read [...] "SWANS ARE NOT DEAD"—an announcement that the band had been reformed as well as a play on words from Swans' live album Swans Are Dead.|$|E

6000|$|... "The wallet {{contained}} {{my entire}} fortune," [...] rejoined Sue calmly, [...] "all that Master Skyffington had placed {{in my hands}} {{on the day that}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>willed</b> that it should be given me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Is it?” said Rollo, {{with much}} {{surprise}} and alarm; “I didn’t know that. What shall I do? Do you suppose <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> count Sunday?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The dear soul {{thought she}} was doing a {{wonderful}} thing for me when she made me an artist, but perhaps, after all, {{it would have been}} better for me if <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> had prevailed and I were now but an honest carpenter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] said Tom, {{looking up}} {{suddenly}} from his meditative {{view of the}} tablecloth, [...] "I don't {{think it would be}} right for my aunt Moss to pay the money if it would be against <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> for her to pay it; would it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{think how}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> unbend in a homelike home, where all {{should be made}} up to him,' he continued, deep emotion {{swelling}} his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> {{speak to}} him, and tell him, that the master, who has fed {{him since he}} was foaled, has now need of him." ...|$|E

60|$|ANN. [alarmed] No no: you mustn't {{lead him}} to believe that I said that: I don't for a moment think that Jack knows his own mind. But it's clear from <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> that he wished me to marry Jack. And my mother is set on it.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{was very}} good of him," [...] Myra said; [...] "when these {{troubles}} are over, Dinah, you may be sure that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>will</b> reward him handsomely." ...|$|E
60|$|My philosophy, Tresham, {{could not}} prevent my {{sharing in the}} honest creature's distress, and we mingled our tears,--the more bitter on my part, as the perverse {{opposition}} to <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will,</b> with which the kind-hearted Owen forbore to upbraid me, rose up to my conscience {{as the cause of}} all this affliction.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Banker {{was not on}} {{good terms}} with my uncle, so the latter knew that if the former became my {{guardian}} the loan that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had consented to make would most likely never be carried out. In this predicament my uncle had taken his first wrong step. He had hidden <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>will</b> and brought forth an old {{one in which he}} himself was named as guardian.|$|R
