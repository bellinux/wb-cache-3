25|$|The State of New Jersey {{instituted a}} cash meal {{allowance}} for its state {{police officers in}} July 1949. Before that, troopers were provided a mid-shift <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> one of several meal stations located throughout the State. The State had decided that this system was unsatisfactory, as it required troopers to leave their patrol areas unattended for extended periods of time. The new system provided troopers with a cash allowance, which troopers could use to purchase a <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> a location within their patrol area, thus making it unnecessary for them to leave the area unmonitored.|$|E

25|$|The Lakers and Kings {{split the}} first two games in Sacramento.

O'Neal had 35 points and 13 rebounds, but struggled with foul trouble; Bryant shot 9-for-21 from the field and was suffering from food poisoning which he contracted from a <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> the team hotel, and some felt it was done deliberately by the hotel staff. The loss snapped the NBA record 12-game playoff road winning streak for the Lakers.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} truckers have unhealthful eating {{patterns}} {{as a result}} of poor food choices and food availability at truck stops is partially to blame. The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or not stored in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular snacking while on the road and consumption of one large <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> the end of day. The daily meal is often high in calories and may be the highlight of the trucker’s day. Food intake varies during working hours compared to days off and truckers eat meals at the wrong circadian phase during the day.|$|E
