2500|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> {{readers who}} want to know whether I am [...] "really" [...] an insider or an {{outsider}} to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both [...] that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other.|$|E

6000|$|Such {{at least}} was {{the spirit of}} <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> invitations.

6000|$|Having said thus much, I {{will take}} up the Judge's {{interrogatories}} as I find them printed in the Chicago Times, and answer them seriatim.

I owe this medal to all who helped me," [...] and added that [...] "This medal will silence my critics. This is <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> them to whatever happened.

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out to me}} that many [...] protesters are non-white and/or [...] "communists." [...] Well <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that is: [...] "Who cares?!" [...] They are against the same evil, corrupted, {{degenerate}} capitalist elitists that we are against! ...Seriously people, just who is our enemy? [...] The unemployed left-wing 25-year-old holding up a sign, or the Judeo-capitalist banksters who swindled the American taxpayers out of a trillion dollars in the [...] "bailout" [...] scam and continue to oppress the white working class?!? ... We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it – only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ... My heart is right there with these people, perhaps someday the [...] "movement" [...] will show the same courage and dedication that these people out there fighting are showing! ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{portion of}} Șăineanu's studies in Romanian {{folklore}} bordered on his investigation of Jewish history. The scholar noticed recurring characteristic among antagonists in Romanian fairy tales, particularly the uriași—occasionally known as jidovi, [...] "Jews", or tătari, [...] "Tatars". He attributed such traits {{to a possible}} conflictual encounter, taking place {{at some point in}} the early medieval period, between Romanians (or Vlachs) and the Khazars, a Turkic tribe that had adopted Judaism. His interpretation, as paraphrased by the scholar himself, concluded: [...] "Was there in the past a people about which one could claim with certainty that it was both Tatar and Jewish at the same time? <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this question is that such a people existed, and it is known in history under the name of Khazars [...] After spreading its domination over Eastern Europe, these Jewish-Tatars suddenly disappeared from the stage of history. What became of them? A part of these Khazars will have looked early on for a shelter in Transylvania, from where they crossed to the Danubian countries, especially in Muntenia, particularly in Muscel and Romanați districts where the traditional memories regarding them seem to be concentrated. [...] The settlements and their dwellings left important traces that took on colossal proportions in people's imagination. People of a supernatural size seemed to have lived [...] in an ancient time, which the old can hardly remember, and our peasants call those giant people Jews or Tatars." [...] The scholar referred to various constants in folkloric accounts: peasants' testimonies which attributed large stone ruins to the Jews (whom they occasionally referred to as giants or supernaturally powerful people) and the [...] "red" [...] antagonists in fairy tales such as Ion Creangă's Harap Alb (the [...] "Red Emperor", the [...] "Red Man" [...] and people with red-colored facial markings, all placed by Șăineanu in connection to the [...] "Red Jews" [...] myth). Șăineanu's political adversaries, including V. A. Urechia, saw in this theory evidence of a Jewish historiographical attempt at overriding the Romanian presence in the area—an interpretation since defined as [...] "in bad faith" [...] and [...] "slanderous" [...] by Laszlo Alexandru.|$|E

60|$|So {{she spoke}} on, still not knowing to what {{decision}} I had come; whether {{she were to}} be blinded or to live or die.

But it may be that she thought thus to impress me and to enmesh me in memories which would tie my hands, or even from the character of <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> draw some augury of her doom.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> was, <b>to</b> {{pass out}} at the gate immediately. She made a hasty gesture with her hand, as if to entreat my {{patience}} and my silence, and turned towards London, whence, as her dress betokened, she had come expeditiously on foot.|$|R

40|$|In the February 2000 {{issue of}} Word Ways, Douglas Fink {{reported}} on the Pangram Film Festival. The idea is to construct a list of film titles which are collectively a pangram (i. e., they use every letter of the alphabet) which is a heterogram (i. e., they do not use any letter more than once). Digits and punctuation may be used freely. Douglas 2 ̆ 7 s article raised questions as to what superlatives are possible among heterogram pangram film lists (from now on in this article, usually just 2 ̆ 2 lists 2 ̆ 2).

Ever and anon his Majesty was saying to me: 'That is very good;--that is excellently thought and expressed;--your mode of proceeding, altogether, pleases me very well;--I rejoice {{to see how much}} our ways of thinking correspond.' Often, too, he had the graciousness to add: 'But, I weary you with my many questions!' His scientific questions I answered with simplicity, clearness and brevity; and could not forbear sometimes expressing my astonishment at the deep and conclusive (TIEFEN UND FRAPPANTEN) medical insights and judgments of the King.|$|R
40|$|While {{a debate}} rages on about {{competing}} reasons why SES may affect health, {{there is little}} recognition that the so-called reverse causation from health to economic status may be pretty fundamental as well. Even if the direction of causation is that SES mainly affects health, what dimensions of SES actually matter—the financial aspects such as income or wealth or non-financial dimensions like education? Finally, is there a life course component to the health gradient {{so that we may}} be mislead in trying <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> these questions by only looking at people of a certain age—say those past 50. This paper, which is divided into four sections, provides <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> these questions. The first section examines the issue of reverse causation or whether a new health event has a significant impact on four dimensions of SES—out-of-pocket medical expenses, labor supply, household income, and household wealth. The next section switches the perspective by asking whether the so-called direct causation from SES to health really matters all that much. If the answer is yes and it will be, a sub-theme in this section concerns which dimensions of SES—income, wealth, or education—matter for individual health. Since the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that question turns out to be education, Section 3 deals with the very much more difficult issue of why education matters so much. The evidence in these first three sections relies on data for people above age 50. In the final section of the paper, I test the robustness of <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> these basic questions of the meaning of the SES-health gradient using data that span the entire life-course. ...|$|R
