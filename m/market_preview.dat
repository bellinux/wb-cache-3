50|$|In March 1981, Evans Broadcasting {{agreed to}} sell the station to Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises. Programming during this time {{continued}} to consist of classic sitcoms, a couple of rejected network shows, and some religious programs during the day. Also in 1981, Channel 30 began carrying business news programming from the Financial News Network. On June 1, 1982, not long after Cox {{took control of the}} station, KDNL-TV began running subscription television service Preview during the nighttime hours, leaving KPLR-TV as the only full-time independent station in the St. Louis <b>market.</b> <b>Preview</b> was dropped nine months later, and the station resumed running the usual primetime fare of movies and classic sitcoms until 1:00 or 2:00 am. Channel 30 regained the broadcast rights to the Blues in 1983 for an additional three seasons. In 1984, cartoons were added to the lineup and the station reduced the number of religious programs on its schedule. Also under Cox ownership, the station won bids to acquire stronger off-network sitcoms.|$|E

50|$|A tryout is {{the staging}} of {{performances}} of a theatrical production (i.e., a play or musical) at an off-site venue for evaluation and possible revision before the production premieres on Broadway or the West End. A tryout {{is similar to}} a workshop production in that the point is to identify and eliminate embarrassing flaws before the production is put on before highly demanding New York or London audiences, but unlike a workshop, it is usually more developed, less rough, and closer to the intended final product. If a tryout goes well and irons out the last few bugs, then that assures the project's investors that when it does debut on Broadway or the West End, it will already be fully polished and more likely to receive favorable reviews and play to sold-out houses for several years, so they can recoup their investment. Conversely, tryouts enable theatrical audiences in less prestigious <b>markets</b> to <b>preview</b> potential future hits and get bragging rights that they saw those works first.|$|R

500|$|In the United Kingdom, Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} on 23 February 1996 in order to [...] "take advantage of the hype from Pride and Prejudice", another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. Columbia Tristar's head of UK marketing noted that [...] "if there was any territory this film was going to work, {{it was in the}} UK." [...] After receiving positive responses at <b>previews,</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences. Attention was also paid to marketing Sense and Sensibility internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being [...] "bigger" [...] than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as [...] "just another English period film." [...] Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the Daily Mail, which compared the film to Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe. Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776, a sum that reflected its commercial success. It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} new evidences to {{the literature}} of assignment {{in the labor market}} for the Colombian case. Specifically it focuses on the existing relationship between acquired human capital in higher education and its congruence in the labor <b>market.</b> Differing from <b>previews</b> studies, the misallocation analysis is not only based on the horizontal component and the educational mismatch, but it also includes the vertical mechanism (vertical mechanism is related to skills mismatch and horizontal mechanism is related to professional career mismatch). Another contribution is how we measure the abilities through an exploratory factor analysis. The data are taken from the Survey of Graduates of Higher Education Institutions 2014, provided by OLE. We employ a two-step treatment effect method proposed by Heckman (1974, 1979) and Lee (1978)), we found that generic abilities raise the probability of horizontal mismatch and diminish the probability of vertical mismatch. On the other hand, specific abilities lower the probability of both horizontal and vertical mismatch. In terms of wages, we found evidence that confirmed the results of the assignment models because it exists a wage penalty for the mismatched individuals (Sattinger, 1993) ...|$|R

50|$|After {{two short}} but {{successful}} runs of A Spoonful of Sherman, during {{the recording of}} the original cast album in December 2014, Sherman turned to Nicholls with the Love Birds concept. Only {{a few of the}} songs were complete and a script had yet to be written but Nicholls liked the concept and the songs he had heard. Nicholls suggested veteran Edinburgh producer, Kat Portman Smith to produce. The script and balance of songs were then composed {{over the next few months}} with a first draft (one act) book and score completed in June 2015. In the meantime, a poster image was commissioned which would set much of the visual tone of the piece moving forward. The poster was created by Rebecca Pitt. A production team was put together consisting of Designer: Gabriella Slade, Lighting Designer: Rob Mills, Sound Designer: Andy Hinton, Casting Director: Stephen Moore, Stage Manager: Roisin Symes, Production Manager: Simon Streeting. Press Representative Susie Safavi and Social Media Manager: Terri Paddock were also brought in at this point. Originally Music Supervision was being handled by Colin Billing who had worked with Nicholls and Sherman on A Spoonful of Sherman the year before. In late June, Billing had to pull out from the production for personal reasons at which point Musical Director: Richard Healey stepped in to do the music arrangements for the show in just under two weeks. Taking Healey's place as Musical Director was Neil MacDonald. Rehearsals commenced in earnest on July 13, 2015 at The Big Wheel rehearsal space in Exmouth <b>Market,</b> London. London <b>Previews</b> were held on the July 28 and 29 at the Lost Theatre in Stockwell. On July 30, the entire Original Cast Album was recorded (in a single day) at Porcupine Studios and mixed over the following two days by Engineer: Nick Taylor. Edinburgh previews began on August 5 with press attending from August 6 onward.|$|R
