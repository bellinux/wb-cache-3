40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the Euro-currency Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a residual maturity breakdown of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary <b>memorandum</b> <b>items</b> (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one <b>memorandum</b> <b>item,</b> viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve flexibility in reserve management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one <b>memorandum</b> <b>item</b> - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the Euro-currency Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|R

Canaday Center for Special Collections may reserve the right to intervene as intermediary at its own discretion. Completed by: Benjamin Grillot, November 1998 -June 1999 Historical Sketch On July 11 th, 1902, The Toledo, Angola and Western Railway with its 8 1 / 4 miles of track, was officially incorporated. Originating as a spur of off the much larger New York Central Line at Central Avenue in Toledo, Ohio, the Railway linked the Silica Stone Quarries to the world. Largely the quarry funded its construction and the construction supplies were shared with the Toledo Terminal Railroad, which was also forming at this time. In 1913 Toledo, Angola and Western bought out the Silica Northern Railway, increasing its track length 2 1 / 4 miles to the northwest, connecting it with Centennial, Ohio. Throughout 1910 's, the Railway began to expand beyond its Stone Quarry roots, serving a variety of industries that popped up around it including an Oil Refinery (Hickock Oil), a Bottling Plant (Owens Bottling Plant), and a Fertilizer Plant (Stadler Fertilizer Company). In 1922, A. C. Dustin was hired as president of the company. Dustin had previously served, since 1906, as President of the Forth Smith and Western Railroad in Arkansas, and his experience led the TA&W through a period of prosperity which peaked in 1929 with the company showing a profit of over $ 55, 000. The crash of the stock market and the subsequent depression hit TA&W fairly hard, forcing them to lay off several employees and turn down many applications for employment. However within 5 years, Dustin's Railroad was again showing a sizeable profit. An interesting side note from this period involves the formation of the Employee's Mutual Aid Society, an organization created by and for the employees of the Railroad, but existing completely separately. The Mutual Aid Society was formed in 1927 after the death of an employee left a widow unable to make payments on her mortgage. This Society eventually transformed into a form of group insurance sponsored by the Railway and it disbanded as an independent organization in 1937. Industries continued to open along Toledo Angola and Western Railway throughout the 30 's, including the France Stone Company (which operated in Silica Ohio) and the Medusa Portland Cement Company which opened a mill at Silica, utilizing the crushed stone from the quarry. Upon the death of A. C. Dustin in 1938, the reigns of the company were passed to J. B. John who ran the company through the 1940 's. The bulk of the Toledo Angola and Western Railway's records date from before 1950, so the details on the companies' history after this point are sketchy until 1979 when the Railway was bought out by the Waterfront Electric Railway. Not a real railroad in the traditional sense of the term, the Waterfront Electric operated in International Park in downtown Toledo, marketing themselves as a tourist attraction. They sold various souvenirs and memorabilia, some items bearing the Toledo Angola and Western name. However {{by the end of the}} 1980 's, Waterfront Electric Railway shut its doors as well, closing a chapter on Toledo railroading history. Scope and Content Note The Toledo, Angola and Western Railway records are broken down into six (6) distinct series, the first four of which deal directly with the Railway, and the last two involve organizations directly related to the business of the Railway. The first series, Office Files, consists of three distinct subsections each comprising a chronological portion of the Railway's history. The subsections are: 1904 - 1916, 1916 - 1918, and 1923 - 1946. These Office Files remain, with the exception of the subsection 1916 - 1918, in their original order and are comprised of correspondence, <b>memoranda,</b> and other <b>items</b> related to specific subjects. The subsection 1916 - 1918 was found grouped together in a single box, although without any sort of organization. Each piece was sorted out and arranged according to subject, the subjects were arranged alphabetically and then arranged chronologically within each folder As the collection was processed, other files were discovered which could be related to a single specific subject, these "subject files" not found in the original groupings of office files were placed in alphabetical order at the end of the subsection 1923 - 1946. The second series, Financial and Administrative Documents was the most difficult to arrange. It consists of several distinct categories, each arranged according to its own, internal logic. The first grouping, Reports, is divided according to the frequency of the issuance of the report. Annual Reports are followed by Monthly Reports, which are followed by Weekly and then Daily Reports. Arranged alphabetically within Annual Reports are an Accountants Report, prepared by a Public Accountant hired by the railroad; Annual Reports of Fatal Accidents (which thankfully read, for the most part, “Nothing to Report”); Annual Reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal body that regulated Commerce; Annual Reports to the Public Utilities Commission, a government organization; Annual Reports to the Tax Commission, a government organization in charge of Tax Collection, which in 1939 changed its name to the Department of Taxation; and finally Audited Reports which sum up the companies activities for those fiscal years. Within the Monthly Reports category are Monthly Comparative Statements of Earnings, which compare on a monthly basis the Revenues of the company with the same month a year prior; Monthly Estimated Results of Operation, which estimates the costs and profits of the company for the upcoming month based upon prior performance; and Monthly Locomotive Inspection Reports, which detail information gleaned from the inspection of the locomotives. The Weekly Reports category is comprised solely of Weekly Load Reports that describe, on a weekly basis, the cargo carried by various trains and their destinations. Daily Reports contain the Daily Conductor’s Reports; Daily Diaries that record such information as the weather, board meetings, and other happenings on a daily basis for an entire year; Daily Interchange Report of Cars that describes the switching of cars during that day; Daily Report of M. of W. Department; Daily Train Inspection; and Switching and Per Diem Reclaim, which contains reports of money earned each day through switching and reclaim. In 1929 the company hired a surveyor to prepare a report to be used for valuation purposes this Surveyor’s Report remains in its own category. The grouping Returns contains only 3 types of returns, Capital Stock Returns, which are returns on the companies’ investments, Income Tax Returns, which are returns on Taxes paid, and Returns Under 15 -A of the Interstate Commerce Act. The third section of the Financial and Administrative Documents series is Ledgers. This section is divided again into three groupings, General Ledgers, Shipping Ledgers and Accounting Ledgers. The General Ledgers consist of Records and Reports the Interstate Commerce Commission Bureau of Valuation. The Shipping Ledgers are composed of Gas Shipment Ledgers that describe shipments of Gas along the Railroad; General Shipment Ledgers, Ledgers of Train Movements; Record of Cars in the Yard; and a Stone Shipment Ledger. The Accounting Ledgers consist of Accounts Received/Payable, Accounts Received, and Accounts Payable. Also included in the Accounting Ledgers are Cash Books, detailing the amount of Cash on Hand, Inbound/Outbound Freight Revenue Ledgers, Inbound Freight Revenue Ledgers and Outbound Freight Revenue Ledgers. In addition, Pay Roll Ledgers, Through Traffic Ledgers, Track Supply Ledgers, a Waybill Ledger, and an Annual Account Ledger are contained in this Accounting Ledger grouping. The fourth and final component of the Financial and Administrative Documents series are items that do not fit into any of the above categories, but are clearly Financial or Administrative. Included in this category are Account Statements, Receipts and Deposit Tickets, Authorities for Expenditure, Balance Sheets, Cancelled Checks, Demurrage, Freight Claims, Pay Roll Account Statements, Pay Roll Deduction Stubs, Purchase Orders, Shipping Orders, and Vouchers. The third series, Printed Materials, is comprised of materials published both by the Railroad and other outside sources. Included in this series are Blueprints and Maps, which contains a handsomely drawn depiction of the track and surrounding area circa 1911. Also included under this heading are a grouping of books used for research and reference purposes by employees of the Railroad, these books have physically been moved however to the Rare Books collection and can be found through The University of Toledo’s library system. A set of Diagrams, Samples and Promotional materials sent to the Toledo, Angola and Western Railway has been grouped together and included in the Printed Materials series, as have publications by the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C.) and the Public Utilities Commission. Manuals for Locomotives and shop equipment as well as Parts Catalogs for replacement parts have been included in this series as well as Schematic Drawings of mechanical parts and Stationary printed for the Railroad are|$|R
