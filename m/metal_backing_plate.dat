40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the late}} 1990 s, new {{developments}} in knee replacement were identified as a priority for research within the NHS. The newer forms of arthroplasty were more expensive and information was needed on their safety and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The Knee Arthroplasty Trial examined the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four aspects of knee replacement surgery: patellar resurfacing, mobile bearings, all-polyethylene tibial components and unicompartmental replacement. DESIGN: This study comprised a partial factorial, pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial with a trial-based cost-utility analysis which was conducted {{from the perspective of}} the NHS and the patients treated. Allocation was computer generated in a 1 [*]:[*] 1 ratio using a central system, stratified by eligible comparisons and surgeon, minimised by participant age, gender and site of disease. Surgeons were not blinded to allocated procedures. Participants were unblinded if they requested to know the prosthesis they received. SETTING: The setting for the trial was UK secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if a decision had been made for them to have primary knee replacement surgery. Patients were recruited to comparisons for which the surgeon was in equipoise about which type of operation was most suitable. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive a knee replacement with the following: patellar resurfacing or no patellar resurfacing irrespective of the design of the prosthesis used; a mobile bearing between the tibial and femoral components or a bearing fixed to the tibial component; a tibial component made of either only high-density polyethylene ('all polyethylene') or a polyethylene bearing fixed to a <b>metal</b> <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> with attached stem; or unicompartmental or total knee replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Other outcomes were Short Form 12; EuroQol 5 D; intraoperative and postoperative complications; additional surgery; cost; and cost-effectiveness. Patients were followed up for a median of 10 years; the economic evaluation took a 10 -year time horizon, discounting costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 3. 5 % per annum. RESULTS: A total of 116 surgeons in 34 centres participated and 2352 participants were randomised: 1715 in patellar resurfacing; 539 in mobile bearing; 409 in all-polyethylene tibial component; and 34 in the unicompartmental comparisons. Of those randomised, 345 were randomised to two comparisons. We can be more than 95 % confident that patellar resurfacing is cost-effective, despite there being no significant difference in clinical outcomes, because of increased QALYs [0. 187; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 025 to 0. 399] and reduced costs (-£ 104; 95 % CI -£ 630 to £ 423). We found no definite advantage or disadvantage of mobile bearings in OKS, quality of life, reoperation and revision rates or cost-effectiveness. We found improved functional results for metal-backed tibias: complication, reoperation and revision rates were similar. The metal-backed tibia was cost-effective (particularly in the elderly), costing £ 35 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence to support the routine resurfacing of the patella and the use of metal-backed tibial components even in the elderly. Further follow-up is required to assess the stability of these findings over time and to inform the decision between mobile and fixed bearings.

Experimental investigation of projectile penetration mechanism into the ceramic/metal plate requires costly sensitive equipment to capture impact phenomenon that completes within microseconds.

Among recent investigations on the protective capability of this ceramic/metal plates, few only discussed the influence of the boundary effects on the ballistic protection.

40|$|The radar {{absorbing}} materials (RAM) {{and structures}} (RAS) {{are widely used}} in aerospace sectors to reduce the RCS of the aircraft, electromagnetic shielding of high reflection surfaces and metal surfaces etc. The stealth technique is the most typical application of electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption technology. Using this technique, the aircraft and warships can evade detection by reducing their radar cross-section (RCS). Initially, the EM radar absorbers were designed using Salisbury screen (Fnate and McCormack, IEEE APS, 1968; Chambers, Electronics Lett., 1994). This type of absorbers {{involves the use of}} resistive sheet and a metallic ground plane to cancel out the reflections from the screen, which may be a disadvantage in stealth technology. The radar absorbing structures are also realized with FSS technology, which provides thin design but shows satisfactory EM performance only at low incidence angle (Singh et al., PIER B, 2012). Recently, introduction of metamaterial technology leads the design of high performance radar absorbers in the frequency range from microwave to terahertz regimes. The permittivity and permeability of metamaterial structure can be controlled by varying the dimensions of its electric and magnetic components. By tuning the resonances of electric and magnetic components, a metamaterial can be impedance-matched to free-space to achieve 100 % absorption without using <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> <b>backing.</b> For instance, in the designing of a metamaterial based absorber, multiple split-ring resonator (SRR) bases with resonant-magnetic inclusion were employed to eliminate the use of metallic <b>backing</b> <b>plates</b> in absorber...|$|R
