He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim.

2500|$|The burs: In the caverns {{above the}} mouth area {{there are several}} spiky burs; when Kurelek was young he had the {{sensation}} that these were stuffing up his throat. One has been dissected, cutting through many layers, only to find a worm in the center. This was {{a reference to the}} doctors' effort of analysis and diagnosis turning out to be [...] "not worth the trouble." [...] Another of the burs is inverted with spikes pointed inward, piercing through a small child. On either side of the bur is a smiling face and an angry face, representing two sides to Kurelek's father. His father is referenced as another bur behind, [...] "the hard domineering blue bur, opening up the mushy yellow bur, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>to</b> release a common lot of burs, my brothers and sisters, and one unique orange one - myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Nathalie Babel Brown, [...] "Babel came to Paris in {{the summer}} of 1935, as part of the {{delegation}} of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1969 general election, the Alliance {{suffered}} substantial losses. The MCA, {{which was}} hardest hit, decided {{to withdraw from}} the government as they felt they were no longer representative of the Chinese community. Ismail was very critical of this decision, and attempted to persuade the MCA President, Tan Siew Sin, to change his mind. Ismail warned that [...] "this decision if not revoked would contribute to rioting and chaos in the country". On 13 May, after several controversial victory rallies were held by the victorious opposition, racial riots broke out in the federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's daughter later said that her father [...] "remained calm, but took out his pistol, put it into his pocket, and went out with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> dinner". On the morning of 14 May, a police escort was dispatched by Tun Abdul Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister, to escort Ismail from his home. Ismail was persuaded to rejoin the government as home affairs minister.|$|E
