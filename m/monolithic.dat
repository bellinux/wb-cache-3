5|$|COBOL {{programs}} were infamous for being <b>monolithic</b> and lacking modularization.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{complex is}} on a rocky ridge over which {{an array of}} <b>monolithic</b> (made of a single block of stone) temples have been carved which {{resemble}} the <b>monolithic</b> temples of Mahabalipuram, Ellora and Dhamnar caves. The central temple of this complex, called the Thakurdwara, has extensive well crafted carvings. This shrine facing east has idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita (made of black-stone).|$|E
5|$|Venur: <b>Monolithic</b> Bahubali statue.|$|E
5|$|An astronomical {{interferometer}} achieves high-resolution observations {{using the}} technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive <b>monolithic</b> telescope.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{has been}} criticized {{throughout}} its life, however, for its verbosity, design process and poor support for structured programming, which resulted in <b>monolithic</b> and incomprehensible programs.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly's kernel is a hybrid, {{containing}} {{features of}} both <b>monolithic</b> and microkernels, {{such as the}} message passing capability of microkernels enabling larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of <b>monolithic</b> kernels for certain critical tasks. The messaging subsystem being developed is {{similar to those found}} in microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly's messaging subsystem has the ability to act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Predating Le Corbusier's work in Chandigarh, the Golconde {{dormitory}} used a <b>monolithic</b> {{concrete structure}} with deep overhangs and louvres {{to adapt to}} specific climatic conditions. The building pioneered the use of reinforced concrete in India.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, Gulf {{moved from}} being a <b>monolithic,</b> {{vertically}} integrated multinational corporation to being more {{of a network of}} allied business interests. This has given the entire Gulf enterprise a high degree of strategic and operational flexibility. It is a move that reflects fundamental change in the economics of international business.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} relationships within clans and communities, {{and to promote}} moderation and equitable distribution of resources, Andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger, <b>monolithic</b> stone tombs to hold the remains of all family members, and that the construction of these tombs was to be undertaken as a shared responsibility {{among members of the}} family to be entombed there.|$|E
5|$|Konsu, and <b>monolithic</b> pillars with phallic {{representation}} {{have also}} been discovered in Madagascar. In ancient Maya, phallic architecture was rare but Uxmal in particular has {{a considerable number of}} phallus-like architectural pieces. It contains a temple known as the Temple of the Phallis and phallic sculptures and motifs.|$|E
5|$|Madlax {{was often}} {{accused of being}} {{secondary}} and reusing Noir stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more <b>monolithic</b> and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary plot.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} <b>monolithic</b> arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the design}} of the {{majority}} of Delian homes, the House of the Lake is an irregular-shaped home (as opposed to a rectangular or square floor plan), located near a sacred lake and inhabited from roughly 300 to 100 BC. The peristyle impluvium is decorated with a geometric-patterned motif around a central rosette, surrounded on all sides by <b>monolithic</b> columns in the Ionic style.|$|E
5|$|The {{receivers}} {{are based}} on <b>Monolithic</b> Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, with low noise amplifiers cooled to 15K, which have 20GHz bandwidths and provide 46dB of amplification. The signals are mixed with a local oscillator to reduce their frequency, prior to correlation with an analog correlator. The system temperatures are between 55 and 75K.|$|E
5|$|The {{screen on}} the Executive was a <b>monolithic</b> seven-segment gallium {{arsenide}} {{light emitting diode}} display, bought from a Canadian firm. The small screen reduced the power consumption and material costs, but it was revised several times in pursuit of lower power consumption, creating issues with the reliability.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{assembly}} {{marked the}} beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had <b>monolithic</b> designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a <b>monolithic</b> station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of Mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.|$|E
5|$|While the Rashtrakutas built {{many fine}} monuments in the Deccan, the most {{extensive}} and sumptuous of their work is the <b>monolithic</b> Kailasanatha temple at Ellora, the temple being a splendid achievement. In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|E
5|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 1905, there was large scale {{damage to the}} temple complex. Substantial part of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying scattered around the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural compactness of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have been carved out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular structural part of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main <b>monolithic</b> temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Naota later finds Haruko {{working in}} his house as a live-in maid. It is later {{discovered}} that Haruko is an investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. Haruko uses Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk. She {{is at odds with}} Medical Mechanica, a <b>monolithic</b> industrial corporation. Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, a special agent of the Bureau of Interstellar Immigration, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. Naota is ultimately drawn into a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a <b>monolithic</b> state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few <b>monolithic</b> ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320Â°C material temperature.|$|E
5|$|System 6 (also {{referred}} to as System Software 6) is a graphical user interface-based operating system for Macintosh computers. It was released in 1988 by Apple Computer and {{was part of the}} classic Mac OS line of operating systems. System 6 was shipped with various Macintosh computers until it was succeeded by System 7 in 1991. The boxed version of System 6 cost $49 when introduced. System 6 is classed as a <b>monolithic</b> operating system. It featured an improved MultiFinder, which allowed for co-operative multitasking.|$|E
5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are <b>monolithic</b> shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also {{constrained}} by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's <b>monolithic</b> stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the <b>monolithic</b> block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the <b>monolithic</b> stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On {{the two sides of the}} entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the symbols}} of Tiruchirappalli, the Rockfort is a {{fortress}} which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock. It consists {{of a set of}} <b>monolithic</b> rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top, and the Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for PÄrvatÄ« as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam {{at the foot of the}} Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.|$|E
5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200â300 requests per second per host to around 10,000â20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from <b>monolithic</b> development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{due to the}} various {{shortcomings}} of <b>monolithic</b> kernels versus microkernels, <b>monolithic</b> kernels were considered obsolete by virtually all operating system researchers. As a result, the design of Linux as a <b>monolithic</b> kernel rather than a microkernel was the topic of a famous debate between Linus Torvalds and Andrew Tanenbaum. There is merit {{on both sides of}} the argument presented in the TanenbaumâTorvalds debate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monolithic</b> kernels are {{designed}} {{to have all of}} their code in the same address space (kernel space), which some developers argue is necessary to increase the performance of the system. Some developers also maintain that <b>monolithic</b> systems are extremely efficient if well written. The <b>monolithic</b> model tends to be more efficient through the use of shared kernel memory, rather than the slower IPC system of microkernel designs, which is typically based on message passing.|$|E
25|$|Colonial powers {{commonly}} classified Muslim-majority {{societies that}} were highly heterogeneous as <b>monolithic,</b> anti-modern and anti-intellectual.|$|E
25|$|The new {{railways}} faced difficulties adopting <b>monolithic</b> {{organizations with}} large social welfare burdens and aging equipment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monolithic</b> approach: The {{equations}} describing multi-physics phenomena are solved simultaneously by {{a single}} solver producing a complete solution.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>monolithic</b> and hybrid kernels, like Linux and Windows NT, {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to malfunctioning drivers impeding the kernel's operation.|$|E
