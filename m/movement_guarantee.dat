30|$|By chapter 6, {{the post}} 1990 s period, the {{implications}} of not systematically and synergistically controlling all three capitals become obvious. Undargaa argues {{that a lack of}} control on livestock and labour by the government, intersecting with stronger institutional control over some aspects of access to land, has resulted in problems such as elite capture, conflict between herders and overgrazing. Chapter 6 focuses in on the modern state’s attempts, and subsequent failures, to regulate the pastoral economy, {{as well as that of}} more recent players: domestic and international non-government organizations. Undargaa’s use of case study data, embedded throughout her chronological account, is particularly strong in this chapter and the next. In chapter 6, for example, she uses this data to illustrate the inherent institutional disconnect between the responsibility of local (bag) leaders to regulate pasture use, their legal inability to regulate the location of registered winter shelters (which is legislated for at the higher order soum level) and the inability of both lower order officials to regulate the migration of new herders and their livestock into their area of management, with freedom of <b>movement</b> <b>guaranteed</b> in Mongolia’s constitution. She goes on to illustrate some of the strategies by which herders respond to or exploit these institutional disconnects: at times relatively benignly in the form of a retreat to pre-collective informal institutions and at other times by the exploitation of networks with those in a position of power for personal gain.|$|R

We assume that the sensors are quite limited: each sensor has a constant number of bits of memory and can respond to a global start signal, and two sensors can communicate only when they are sufficiently close to each other. In this scenario, the sensors are mobile, but {{have no control over}} how they move, that is, they are passively mobile. Initially, we assume that the underlying pattern of <b>movement</b> <b>guarantees</b> a fairness condition on the interactions: every pair of birds in the flock repeatedly come sufficiently close to each other for their sensors to communicate. Under these assumptions, there is a simple protocol ensuring that every sensor eventually contains the correct answer. At the global start signal, each sensor makes a measurement, resulting in a 1 (elevated temperature) or 0 (not elevated temperature) in a counter that can hold values from 0 to 4. When two sensors communicate, one of them sets its counter to the sum of the two counters, and the other one sets its counter to 0. If two counters ever sum to at least 5, the sensors go into a special alert state, which is then copied by every sensor that encounters it. The outpu...|$|R

This concept represents the 3 D repositioning of skeletal segments without including orthodontic movements in computerized simulations, especially in cases of only mandibular surgery. For example, while performing the bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy for correcting asymmetric mandibular prognathism after using classical presurgical orthodontics, occlusion-based simulation would be helpful for simulating postoperative outcomes. Based on the simulated postoperative occlusion and intercuspation, distal mandibular segments would be mobilized. However, these <b>movements</b> cannot <b>guarantee</b> optimized skeletal symmetry [13].

This research exploits a new {{world in which the}} central architectural element is optical networking, not computers. This transition is caused by the use of parallelism, as in supercomputing a decade ago. However, this time the parallelism is in multiple wavelengths of light, or lambdas, on single optical fibers, creating supernetworks. Dedicated 1 - to 10 -Gigabit deterministic network connections are being deployed internationally by the Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF), nationally by the National LambdaRail (NLR), regionally by academic consortia, and locally on campuses, connecting scientists’ laboratories to collaborators and/or data sources all over the world, providing researchers with guaranteed bandwidth for data <b>movement,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> latency for visualization/collaboration and data analysis, and guaranteed scheduling for remote instrument control. Bandwidth alone isn’t the solution; the OptIPuter is working on new grid-computing paradigms − that is, new middleware, transport protocols and optical signaling, control and management software − to enable applications to dynamically manage lambda resources just as they do any grid resource, creating a Lambda-Grid of interconnected high-performance computers, data storage devices, and instrumentation.

40|$|Researching the {{equality}} implications {{of being a}} migrant in Britain is hampered by imprecise definitions of what a migrant is and {{by a lack of}} data on many equality groups (groups which share a common attribute in respect of age, disability, gender, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation, as defined by the Equality Act 2006). The literature and evidence on inequalities tends to be more abundant on gender and race but remains focused on ethnic minority categories rather than on migrants as such. While the foreign-born population in the UK has increased from four to six million over the last decade, people arrive via different routes and with varying intentions. Much recent debate on the benefits and pressures resulting from immigration has been provoked by the large numbers of arrivals from Eastern Europe since 2004, but they, like other migrants from the European Union (EU), have freedom of <b>movement</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by EU Directives. Although they have to register or obtain authorisation to work legally (and 766, 000 had registered by the end of 2007), there are few reliable statistics on their presence in specific areas or in the UK as a whole. Other migrants from outside the EU also come to the UK to work (about 200, 000 in 2006) or study (309, 000 in 2006). A number of migrants, estimated at between 310, 000 and 570, 000, are believed to be living in the country without formal immigration authorisation. In 2007, the largest group of those born abroad was from India (553, 300), followed by those from Poland (423, 300).

Instead, Cuba refused to ally with the United States and held firm to its socialist ideology. Although Cuba was steadfast in its ideology, it was forced to change its foreign policy tactics in order to survive in the new world order.

40|$|Within the United States of America, the LGBT {{community}} has suffered not only gross levels {{of discrimination and}} victimization, this community {{continues to this day}} to suffer a level of inequality that puts into question the nation’s commitment to liberal democratic principles, such as human, political, and civil rights. From the Stonewall Riots of the 1960 s to the legalization of same-sex marriage in 13 states throughout the Republic, the LGBT {{community has}} had to struggle immensely to be recognized as a group of citizens who are equally deserving of the freedoms and rights allotted to all Americans. Nevertheless, same-sex couples in the majority of states within the United States of America are banned from entering the public institution of marriage. The disparity on the recognition of same-sex marriage is a violation of the Freedom of Internal <b>Movement</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 of the US Constitution, as well as, the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the same. This paper examines the concept of liberal democracy and liberal democratic values. It establishes that freedom of internal mobility is inherent to a liberal democracy. Then, I conduct an analysis of the importance of internal mobility within the United States through the review of a Supreme Court case; this later provides the basis necessary to analyze the four states with four levels of recognition of same-sex marriage. These four states are: South Carolina (constitutional ban), New Mexico (no prohibition, nor recognition), New Jersey (civil unions) and New York (marriage equality). The reality established by the different levels of recognition of same-sex marriage is one that is unique to the LGBT community because it creates two costs of mobility from which heterosexual couples are exempt. These two costs are a lack of access to benefits available through marriage and a condition of restricted autonomy. This paper shows that the costs same-sex couples must face are due to invidious discrimination and do not constitute a compelling government interest for the states that have a ban on same-sex marriage; therefore, it represents a sort of institutionalization of inequality for a group of Americans who met all other requirements to obtain a marriage license. As a result, the disparity among states on the recognition of same-sex marriage impedes on American same-sex couples’right to migrate freely throughout the Republic, rendering this disparity as unconstitutional...|$|R
