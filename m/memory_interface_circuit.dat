Many important applications are memory bound and others are expected to become memory bound in the future. The importance of memory performance makes it imperative to understand and optimize the interactions between applications and the system architecture. Prototyping and exploring various configurations of memory systems can give important insights, but current <b>memory</b> <b>interfaces</b> are limited in the amount of flexibility they provide. This inflexibility stems primarily from the fixed timing of the <b>memory</b> <b>interface.</b> Packetized <b>memory</b> <b>interfaces</b> abstract away the underlying timing characteristics of the memory technology and allow greater flexibility in the design of memory hierarchies.
