They were known {{to have a lot of}} firepower, were highly mobile and very survivable but they were also very heavy, mostly in the range of 50 tons, and the SAF needed something lighter. The SAF needed the Primus to weigh less than 30 tons and be no wider than 3 metres, for it to move across bridges and through the local vegetation. Hence the decision was made to develop a completely new self-propelled howitzer.|$|E

Hard shells declined rapidly among the general cyclist population over this period, almost disappearing {{by the end of the}} decade, but remained more popular with BMX riders as well as inline skaters and skateboarders.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division {{carried out}} a <b>market</b> <b>survey</b> which showed {{that there was a}} demand for a low-cost, {{lightweight}} two-seat helicopter. The division began building the Model 269 in September 1955. It was initially designed with a fully glazed cockpit with seating for two pilots, or a pilot and passenger. It also had an open-framework fuselage and a three-blade articulated rotor. The prototype flew on 2 October 1956, but it wasn't until 1960 that {{the decision was made to}} develop the helicopter for production. The original truss-work tailboom was replaced with a tubular tailboom and the cockpit was restructured and refined prior to being put into production. With this model, Hughes successfully captured a large portion of the civilian helicopter market with an aircraft that would prove itself popular in agriculture, police work and other duties.|$|E
