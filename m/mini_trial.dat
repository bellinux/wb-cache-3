40|$|It {{has become}} commonplace in commentaries on the ‘justice gap’ in rape cases to lament the {{existence}} of a ‘real rape’ stereotype which prevents assaults involving known assailants, which take place in private spaces and perhaps without the use of additional physical violence, from being accepted as genuine and/or serious violations, whether by police, prosecutors or jurors. In previous work, we have urged caution lest too much reliance on the ‘real rape’ stereotype disguise the complexities at play in framing jurors' responses to rape cases involving acquaintances. In this article, we take these reflections further, drawing on a recent study conducted by the authors in which 160 members of the public were recruited and, having observed one of four <b>mini</b> <b>trial</b> reconstructions involving an alleged rape by the complainant's ex-partner, were divided into juries and asked to deliberate towards a verdict. Though the vast majority of our jurors were receptive, in principle, to the idea that a woman could be raped by a man with whom she had previously had a relationship—and indeed often noted the statistical prevalence of such assaults—participants continued to consider these cases to be ‘less clear-cut’, ‘more delicate’ and ‘a lot harder’ than rapes involving a stranger. In line with our previous findings in the context of acquaintance rapes, the fact of a familiarity between the trial parties created an opportunity for jurors to invoke and rely upon engrained expectations regarding resistance and sexual (mis) communication, which—when combined with persuasive strategies that interpreted the standard of proof as requiring nothing short of absolute certainty—mitigated against the likelihood of returning a guilty verdict. Significantly, though, as we will illustrate in this article, the fact of a previous intimate relationship interacted with these expectations in heightened and often quite specific ways to create new tropes...|$|E

The most critical geotechnical challenges are excessive settlement and differential settlement leading to hazardous and discomfort in road usage and distress in buildings. The focus {{of this research is}} to minimize the differential and non-uniform settlement on peat soil with the use of an innovative cellular mat. The behavior and performance of the lightweight material (in block form) was investigated and in particular the use as a fill in embankment on soft ground in both physical and numerical modelling. Peat soil, sponge and innovative cellular mat were used as physical modelling where else PLAXIS 2 D was selected as the numerical modelling part whereby both of these modelling act as the main research material in this study. The initial part of this research (physical modelling) had taken place in monitoring in settlement behaviour thus it will be only done as laboratory testing. The laboratory model test was conducted in a steel tank of size 100 cm (length) x 50 cm (width) and 60 cm (height). The bottom, back face and the sides of the tank were made of steel. The front wall of the test tank was fabricated from a 15 mm thick perspex glass plate to observe failure mechanism. The uneven settlement with problem was uniquely monitored photographically using spot markers. For the numerical method, the data/input through past literature review and also through the testing done in peat from Parit Nipah had been applied in both Mohr Coulomb and Soft Soil constitutive of models thus comparing the occurrence of settlement behaviour including the presence of new innovative lightweight material. These physical and numerical modelling were carried out as to simulate the real problem and case study in Parit Yaani, Batu Pahat, Johor approaching to the bridge connected with embankment. The <b>mini</b> <b>trial</b> embankment test was built with the innovative cellular mats place underneath to identify the suitable cover depth thus propose in laying these new lightweight mats under the embankment surface in the future (real site/field testing).

40|$|Objectives: Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{often have}} heightened levels of anxiety, {{which has been}} associated with worse performance on working memory tasks. Knowledge of the neural pathways underlying the combined presence of ADHD and anxiety may aid in a better understanding of their co-occurrence. Therefore, we investigated how anxiety modulates the effect of ADHD severity on neural activity during a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task. Methods: Neuroimaging data were available for 371 adolescents and young adults participating in the multicentre cohort study NeuroIMAGE (average age 17. 1 years). We analysed the effects of ADHD severity, anxiety severity and their interaction on-task accuracy, and on neural activity associated with working memory (VSWM <b>trials</b> <b>minus</b> baseline), and memory load (high memory load <b>trials</b> <b>minus</b> low load <b>trials).</b> Results: Anxiety significantly modulated the relation between ADHD severity and neural activity in the cerebellum for the working memory contrast, and bilaterally in the striatum and thalamus for the memory load contrast. Conclusions: We found that ADHD with co-occurring anxiety is associated with lowered neural activity during a VSWM task in regions important for information gating. This fits well with previous theorising on ADHD with co-occurring anxiety, and illustrates the neurobiological heterogeneity of ADHD...|$|R

40|$|A ship’s energy {{efficiency}} performance is generally estimated by conducting special sea trials of few hours under very controlled environmental conditions of calm sea, standard draft and optimum trim. This indicator is then {{used as the}} benchmark for future reference of the ship’s Energy Efficiency Performance (EEP). In practice, however, for greater part of operating life the ship operates in conditions which are far removed from original sea trial conditions and therefore comparing energy performance with benchmark performance indicator is not truly valid. In such situations a higher fuel consumption reading from the ship fuel meter {{may not be a}} true indicator of poor machinery performance or dirty underwater hull. Most likely, the reasons for higher fuel consumption may lie in factors other than the condition of hull and machinery, such as head wind, current, low load operations or incorrect trim [1]. Thus a better and more accurate approach to determine {{energy efficiency}} of the ship attributable only to main machinery and underwater hull condition will be to filter out the influence of all spurious and non-standard operating conditions from the ship’s fuel consumption [2]. The author in this paper identifies parameters of a suitable filter to be used on the daily report data of a typical LNG tanker of 33000 kW shaft power to remove effects of spurious and non-standard ship operations on its fuel consumption. The filtered daily report data has been then used to estimate actual fuel efficiency of the ship and compared with the sea trials benchmark performance. Results obtained using data filter show closer agreement with the benchmark EEP than obtained from the monthly <b>mini</b> <b>trials.</b> The data filtering method proposed in this paper has the advantage of using the actual operational data of the ship and thus saving cost of conducting special sea trials to estimate ship EEP.

Introducing facial-expression primes into a probabilistic learning task, we investigated how affective arousal regulates reward-related choice based on behavioral, model fitting, and feedback-related negativity (FRN) data. Sixty-six paid subjects {{were randomly assigned}} to the Neutral-Neutral (NN), Angry-Neutral (AN), and Happy-Neutral (HN) groups. A total of 960 trials were conducted. Subjects in each group were randomly exposed to half trials of the pre-determined emotional faces and another half of the neutral faces before choosing between two cards drawn from two decks with different assigned reward probabilities. Trial-by-trial data were fit with a standard reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. The temporal dynamics of brain activity were simultaneously recorded and analyzed using event-related potentials. Our analyses revealed that subjects in the NN group gained more reward values than those in the other two groups; they also exhibited comparatively differential estimated model-parameter values for reward prediction errors. Computing the difference wave of FRNs in reward versus non-reward trials, compared to the NN group, we found that subjects in the AN and HN groups had larger General FRNs (i. e., FRNs in no-reward <b>trials</b> <b>minus</b> FRNs in reward trials) and Expected FRNs (i. e., FRNs in expected reward-omission <b>trials</b> <b>minus</b> FRNs in expected reward-delivery trials), indicating an interruption in predicting reward.

Exogenous processes can {{be triggered by}} visual targets presented at a previously unattended location, thus capturing attention in a stimulus-driven manner. However, {{little is known about}} the relative role of stimulus salience and behavioral relevance for this type of spatial reorienting. Here, we directly assessed how salience and relevance affect activation of the frontoparietal attentional system, using either low-salience but task-relevant target stimuli or salient but task-irrelevant flickering checkerboards. We compared event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging responses for stimuli presented at the unattended versus attended side (invalid <b>minus</b> valid <b>trials),</b> separately for the 2 categories of visual stimuli. We found that task-relevant invalid targets activated the frontopar-ietal attentional network, demonstrating that this system engages when target stimuli are presented at an unattended location, even when these have a low perceptual salience. Conversely, the pre-sentation of high-salience checkerboards in one hemifield while endogenous attention was engaged elsewhere did not activate the attentional network. These findings indicate that task relevance is critical for stimulus-driven engagement of the attentional network when attentional resources are endogenously allocated somewhere else...|$|R

40|$|Our aim was {{to adapt}} the {{traditional}} framework for expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS) to be more compatible with drug development trials from the pharmaceutical perspective. We modify the traditional framework for conducting ENBS and assume {{that the price of}} the drug is conditional on the trial outcomes. We use a value-based pricing (VBP) criterion to determine price conditional on trial data using Bayesian updating of cost-effectiveness (CE) model parameters. We assume that there is a threshold price below which the company would not market the new intervention. We present a case study in which a phase III trial sample size and trial duration are varied. For each trial design, we sampled 10 [*] 000 trial outcomes and estimated VBP using a CE model. The expected commercial net benefit is calculated as the expected profits <b>minus</b> the <b>trial</b> costs. A clinical trial with shorter follow-up, and larger sample size, generated the greatest expected commercial net benefit. Increasing the duration of follow-up had a modest impact on profit forecasts. Expected net benefit of sampling can be adapted to value clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry to optimise the expected commercial net benefit. However, the analyses can be very time consuming for complex CE models. © 2014 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

In a context in which research into the substantive content of the deliberations of real jurors is prohibited by the Contempt of Court Act 1981, these discussions were analysed to assess whether, and in what ways, perceptions of adult rape testimony are influenced by different modes of presentation. While lawyers and other observers have speculated about the possible undue effects of alternative trial arrangements on juror perceptions and the evaluation of evidence in rape trials, the issue has received scant empirical attention. In an effort to bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigated the influence upon mock jurors of three special measures currently made available in England and Wales to adult sexual offence complainants by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, namely (1) live-links; (2) video-recorded evidence-in-chief followed by live-link cross-examination and (3) protective screens. Following a careful and contextual exploration of the content of the mock juries’ deliberations, the researchers conclude that there was no clear or consistent impact {{as a result of these}} divergent presentation modes, suggesting that concerns over the use of special measures by adult rape complainants (at least in terms of juror influence) may be overstated.

In its calibration, <b>minus</b> power <b>trial</b> lens was {{placed at the}} objective of the telescope to simulate vergence of a target at a finite distance, before the back vertex power (BVP) of the telescope at each setting (telescope length) was measured by a focimeter. By using a graphical presentation of the results, the BVP of the telescope at each setting could be determined at different selected target distances. For a target vergence of − 0. 167 D or a distance of 6 m, the common testing distance in clinical practice, this calibrated telescope had a BVP or refraction measuring range of − 7. 27 –+ 7. 52 D. When this telescope was used to measure simulated manifest refractive errors at 6 m, it yielded a mean error of + 0. 13 D with a 95 % confidence limit of agreement of − 0. 38 –+ 0. 64 D. These results indicated that the accuracy and precision of telescopic refraction were comparable to that of retinoscopy. Therefore, the calibrated telescope could be considered as a reliable and inexpensive instrument for determining spherical refractive errors. Telescopic refraction is applicable in refracting economically disadvantaged population in under-served areas where modern equipment and electricity are not available. In addition, it provides an alternative subjective refraction method for low vision population because the magnification of this calibrated telescope has the advantage of allowing low vision patients to be refracted at the common 6 m testing distance in clinical practice.

Two event-related-potential (ERP) components classically {{associated with the}} processing of stimulus conflict are the fronto-central, incongruency-related negativity (N-inc) and the posterior late-positive complex (LPC), which are derived from the ERP difference waves for incongruent <b>minus</b> congruent <b>trials.</b> It has been questioned, however, whether these effects, or other neural measures of incongruency (e. g., fMRI responses in the anterior cingulate), reflect true conflict processing, or whether such effects derive mainly from differential time-on-task. To address this question, we leveraged high-temporal-resolution ERP measures of brain activity during two behavioral tasks. The first task, a modified Erikson flanker paradigm (with congruent and incongruent trials), was used to evoke the classic RT and ERP effects associated with conflict. The second was a non-conflict control task in which, participants visually discriminated a single stimulus (with easy and hard discrimination conditions). Behaviorally, the parameters were titrated to yield similar RT effects of conflict and difficulty (27 ms). Neurally, both within-task contrasts showed an initial fronto-central negative polarity wave (N 2 -latency effect), but they then diverged. In the difficulty difference wave, the initial negativity led directly into the posterior LPC, whereas in the incongruency contrast the initial negativity was followed a by a second fronto-central negative peak (N-inc), which was then followed by a considerably longer-latency LPC. These results provide clear evidence that the longer processing for incongruent stimulus inputs do not just reflect time-on-task or difficulty, but include a true conflict-processing component...|$|R

Methods: A total of 76 patients who were candidate for carpal tunnel release from September 2005 to April 2009 were divided randomly in two groups. Group I was treated by classic open surgery, while group II was treated by mini open surgery with knife light. Patients were visited at first, second, fourth and eighth weeks post operation. Complications and symptoms including pain(by visual analog scale) were registered. Patients were advised to start daily routines as soon as their pain and symptoms reduced. Results: Statistically, both groups were same regarding sex and age and symptoms were reduced considerably in both groups. Pain and post operative symptoms disappeared earlier in group II and they returned to work sooner than the other group. Complications in two groups were similar.

40|$|Azolla filiculoides {{has been}} {{evaluated}} for the adsorption of trace toxic metals from aqueous solution. The adsorption {{performance of the}} material was compared with commercial resins and fitted using the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Freundlich model described the adsorption of copper and cadmium. Whilst the Langmuir isotherm had the better fit of the mercury data. The assumptions of the Freundlich model include multi-layer adsorption and different functional group binding. Conversely the Langmuir model suggests mono-layer adsorption and can infer single group reactivity. The pH effect on the uptake of the metals was investigated {{and an increase in}} removal was observed at higher pH with all the metals studied. The material has been thoroughly characterised using physical methods, such as, scanning electron microscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility measurements. This enabled conclusions to be made regarding the surface functionality of the solid. Chemical characterisation included direct titrations, revealing a gradual dissociation of acidic groups as the pH increased within the experimental range. Kjeldahl nitrogen and amino acid analysis of several biological materials that have been used in metal sorption experiments showed A. filiculoides as having a large proportion of these cell constituents. The kinetics of metal ion uptake by the biosorbent was investigated and compared with commercially available resins. The kinetics are slower than conventional ion exchange resins and carbon adsorbents but entirely adequate for utilisation in a column process. The mechanism hypothesized for metal ion removal by the biosorbent is primarily attributed to ionogenic groups exchanging ions for copper and cadmium removal. Mercury on the other hand is said to be predominantly involved in a reduction-precipitation reaction {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent. Regeneration was successfully accomplished for copper and cadmium after minicolumn trials, with greater than 95 % elution of the metals using 0. 1 M HCI. The <b>mini</b> column <b>trials</b> showed a sharp breakthrough for these metals singularly and a dynamic equilibrium was observed during multi-metal processing.

40|$|Much {{research}} has investigated {{the relationship between}} the Approximate Number System (ANS) and mathematical achievement, with continued debate surrounding the existence of such a link. The use of different stimulus displays may account for discrepancies in the findings. Indeed, closer scrutiny of the literature suggests that studies supporting a link between ANS acuity and mathematical achievement in adults have mostly measured the ANS using spatially intermixed displays (e. g. of blue and yellow dots), whereas those failing to replicate a link have primarily used spatially separated dot displays. The current study directly compared ANS acuity when using intermixed or separate dots, investigating how such methodological variation mediated the relationship between ANS acuity and mathematical achievement. ANS acuity was poorer and less reliable when measured with intermixed displays, with performance during both conditions related to inhibitory control. Crucially, mathematical achievement was significantly related to ANS accuracy difference (accuracy on congruent <b>trials</b> <b>minus</b> accuracy on incongruent trials) when measured with intermixed displays, but not with separate displays. The findings indicate that methodological variation affects ANS acuity outcomes, as well as the apparent relationship between the ANS and mathematical achievement. Moreover, the current study highlights the problem of low reliabilities of ANS measures. Further research is required to construct ANS measures with improved reliability, and to understand which processes may be responsible for the increased likelihood of finding a correlation between the ANS and mathematical achievement when using intermixed displays...|$|R
40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: A large {{sector of}} the popu-lation of the United States has sleep {{deprivation}} di-rectly leading to excessive daytime sleepiness. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness in this population ranges from 0. 3 % to 13. 3 %. The conse-quences of even 1 to 2 hours of sleep loss nightly may result in decrements in daytime functions resulting in human error, accidents, and catastrophic events. The magnitude of risks in the workplace or on the high-ways resulting from sleepiness is not fully understood or appreciated by the general population. Hence, to more clearly emphasize the magnitude of these risks, we question whether mild sleep deprivation may {{have the same effect}} as alcohol on reaction times and driving performance. Study Design: Nonrandomized prospective cohort investigation. Methods: Sixteen healthy matched adult subjects (50 % women) were stratified into two groups, sleep deprived and alcohol challenged. The sleep-deprived group was further subdivided into acute (one night without sleep) and chronic (2 h less sleep nightly for 7 d) sleep depriva-tion. Each group underwent baseline reaction time testing and then drove on a closed course set up to test performance. Seven days later, the group re-peated this sequence after either sleep deprivation or alcohol intake. Results: There were no significant between-group differences (sleep deprivation or alco-hol challenged) in the changes before and after inter-vention for all 11 reaction time test metrics. More-over, with few exceptions, the magnitude of change was nearly identical in the two groups, despite a mean blood alcohol concentration of 0. 089 g/dL in the alcohol-challenged group. On-track driving perfor-mances were similar (P 5. 724) when change scores (hits and errors) between groups were compared (baseline <b>minus</b> final driving <b>trial).</b> Conclusion: This comparative model suggests that the potential risks of driving while sleepy are at least as dangerous as the risks of driving illegally under the influence of alcohol...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions in the planning of medical experiments to assess the performance of new drugs or treatments, is how big to make the trial. The problem, in its statistical formulation, is to determine the optimal size of a trial. The most frequently used methods of determining sample size in clinical trials is based on the required p-value, and the required power of the trial for a specified treatment effect. In contrast to the Bayesian decision theoretic approach there is no explicit balancing of the cost of a possible increase {{in the size of the}} trial against the benefit of the more accurate information which it would give. In this work we consider a fully Bayesian (or decision theoretic) approach to sample size determination in which the number of subsequent users of the therapy under investigation, and hence also the total benefit resulting from the trial, depend on the strength of the evidence provided by the trial. Our procedure differs from the usual Bayesian decision theory methodology, which assumes a single decision maker, by recognizing the existence of three decision makers, namely: the pharmaceutical company conducting the trial, which decides on its size; the regulator, whose approval is necessary for the drug to be licenced for sale; and the public at large, who determine the ultimate usage. Moreover, we model the subsequent usage by plausible assumptions for actual behaviour, rather than assuming that this represents decisions which are in some sense optimal. For this reason the procedure may be called "Behavioural Bayes" (or BeBay for short), the word Bayes referring to the optimization of the sample size. In the BeBay methodology the total expected benefit from carrying out the <b>trial</b> <b>minus</b> the cost of the trial is maximized. For any additional sales to occur as a result of the trial it must provide sufficient evidence both to convince the regulator to issue the necessary licence and to convince potential users that they should use the new treatment. The necessary evidence is in the form of a high probability after the trial that the new treatment achieves a clinically relevant improvement compared to the alternative treatment. The regulator is assumed to start from a more sceptical and less well-informed view of the likely performance of the treatment than the company carrying out the trial. The total benefit from a conclusively favourable trial is assessed on the basis of the size of the potential market and aggregated over the anticipated life-time of the product, using appropriate discounting for future years...|$|R
