5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> but with {{the realization of the}} important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E

The breed enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis. Today, the breed is enjoying a revival, {{due to the}} demands of the beef market. The breed is considered average size and they have a thick coat, due to the climate of their native Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{appear in}} mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and {{probably}} the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga.

5|$|Researchers have {{discovered}} archaeological evidence of musical instruments in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Some finds are 67,000 years old, however {{their status as}} musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Another commercial source, far {{less important than}} barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management {{practices such as}} cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time {{with the use of}} draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E

Foie gras is considered a luxury in <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|Myxogastria are {{distributed}} worldwide; species were found by early researchers on all continents. However, as <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were yet not discovered or explored, the exact distribution {{is not fully}} known. Europe and North America are often considered the basic habitat of the Myxogastria species. According to recent research, the majority of species are not widely distributed. The Myxogastria are most commonly found in temperate latitudes, and rarely in the polar regions, the subtropics or tropics. The physical features of the substrate and climatic conditions are the major aspects of the species' presence. Endemism is rare.|$|E
