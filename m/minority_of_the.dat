Neopaganism in the United Kingdom {{is primarily}} represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales, including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not. Only a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.|$|E
5|$|Damascus {{subsequently}} {{became the}} capital of the Ummayad Caliphate and all of the surplus revenue of the Ummayad Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus.

5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's urban elite, {{and it is not}} spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males attend an active lek. As {{alternative}} strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Flavian period {{also saw}} the first {{formation}} of large, double-size units, both infantry and cavalry, of a nominal strength of 1,000 men (cohors/ala milliaria), though they were actually mostly smaller (720 for an ala milliaria and 800 for a cohors milliaria). These were the {{mirror image of the}} double-strength first cohorts of legions also introduced at this time. Such units remained a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auxilia: in the mid-2nd century, they constituted 13% of units, containing 20% of total manpower.|$|E

5|$|The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage {{took place}} in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later.

The CHA decided that they also had to broaden the scope of intangible heritage to properties {{that do not have}} any designated 'holders', like kimchi, hangul or Goryeo ginseng.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total number of emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have {{national}} grasslands). In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest. Alaska has {{the most}} national forest land with 21.9 million acres (8.9 million ha), followed by California (20.8 million acres, 8.4 million ha) and Idaho (20.4 million acres, 8.3 million ha). Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually only a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land {{is owned by the}} Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian {{are one of}} {{only two}} {{full-time}} professional football clubs in Edinburgh, which is the capital of and second largest city in Scotland. The club had the fourth largest average attendance in the Scottish leagues during the 2016–17 season, with 15,394. This was a significant increase on recent seasons, inspired by the Scottish Cup victory in 2016. In the period after the Second World War, Hibs attracted average attendances in excess of 20,000, peaking at 31,567 in the 1951–52 season. Since Easter Road was redeveloped into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s, average attendance has varied between a high of 15,394 in 2016–17 and a low of 9,150 in 2003–04. In the 1980s and 1990s, a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, known as the Capital City Service.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's {{supporters}} had {{a reputation}} as one of Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E
