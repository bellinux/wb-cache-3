40|$|We have reinvestigated 33 fragile X {{families}} using probe StB 12. 3. In 31 families {{the affected}} individual showed <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> while in 2 families no insert was detected. The insert fell into two size categories: small ( 0. 6 kb) accompanied by methylation of an EagI site. All individuals of either sex having <b>a</b> small <b>insert</b> were fra(X) negative and intellectually normal, while all males having <b>a</b> large <b>insert</b> were fra(X) positive and intellectually impaired. Females having <b>a</b> large <b>insert</b> were either fra(X) {{positive or negative}} and either intellectually normal or impaired. No new mutation was found. All daughters of males with <b>a</b> small <b>insert</b> had <b>a</b> small insert; females with <b>a</b> large <b>insert</b> produced males and females who had <b>a</b> large <b>insert,</b> while females with <b>a</b> small <b>insert</b> had offspring with either a large or <b>a</b> small <b>insert.</b> However, females with <b>a</b> small <b>insert</b> tended to {{fall into one of}} two categories: either they had only children with <b>a</b> small <b>insert</b> or only children with <b>a</b> large <b>insert,</b> there being only one exception to this rule.

2500|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and [...] intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Demolition Sergeant serving with the First Battalion, Twenty-First Marines, Third Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Island, 23 February 1945. Quick to volunteer his services when our tanks were maneuvering vainly to open a lane for the infantry through the network of reinforced concrete pillboxes, buried mines and black, volcanic sands, Corporal Williams daringly went forward alone to attempt the reduction of devastating machine-gun fire from the unyielding positions. Covered only by four riflemen, he fought desperately for four hours under terrific enemy small-arms fire and repeatedly returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers, struggling back, frequently to the rear of hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. On one occasion he daringly <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> pillbox to <b>insert</b> the nozzle of his flame thrower through the air vent, kill the occupants and silence the gun; on another he grimly charged enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and destroyed them with a burst of flame from his weapon. His unyielding determination and extraordinary heroism in the face of ruthless enemy resistance were directly instrumental in neutralizing one of the most fanatically defended Japanese strong points encountered by his regiment and aided in enabling his company to reach [...] objective. Corporal Williams' aggressive fighting spirit and valiant devotion to duty throughout this fiercely contested action sustain and enhance the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|R

2500|$|Reporter genes: Some vectors {{may contain}} a {{reporter}} gene {{that allow for}} identification of plasmid that contains inserted DNA sequence. [...] An example is lacZ-α which codes for the N-terminus fragment of β-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose. [...] A multiple cloning site is located within lacZ-α, and <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the gene sequence, resulting in an inactive β-galactosidase. [...] Cells containing vector with <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing β-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain <b>an</b> <b>insert)</b> appear as blue colonies.
