5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere.

5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are {{devoid of}} known <b>moons</b> due <b>to</b> the Kozai instability.

5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the <b>Moon,</b> <b>to</b> complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it {{to land on the}} Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E

5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, Out of the Trees, but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E

50|$|Set in {{a fantasy}} land of Ogriss {{far away from}} the other races, a human sorcerer named Fraziel set out to create what was {{currently}} only known as the “Great Machine”. In order to build his device, he conjured up goblin servants, each faction forming their own clan under each moon. First was Grommel (the protagonist) of the Stonekrusher clan, under the white <b>moon</b> Froxx, <b>to</b> serve as miners in the deep caves. Second was Grax of the Hellfire clan, under the red <b>moon</b> Heelinx, <b>to</b> harvest wood in the forest. Third was Faine of the Stormbringer clan, under the blue <b>moon</b> Trist, <b>to</b> channel lightning in the mountains. Fourth was Syst of the Plaguespitter clan, under the green <b>moon</b> Phoust, <b>to</b> farm in the marshes.

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E

5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had walked on the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E
5|$|The Who first {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} opening date {{of a series of}} Lifehouse related concerts in the Young Vic theatre, London on 14 February 1971. It has subsequently been part of every Who concert since, often as the set closer and sometimes extended slightly to allow Townshend to smash his guitar or <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> kick over his drumkit. The group performed live over the synthesizer part being played on a backing tape, which required <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> wear headphones to hear a click track, allowing him to play in sync. It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976 and the last song he ever played with the Who at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film The Kids Are Alright. The song was part of the Who's set at Live Aid in 1985, Live 8 in 2005, T4 on the Beach in 2008 and Capital FM's Summertime Ball concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's Jingle Bell Ball concerts in 2009 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the moons}} of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd <b>moons</b> <b>to</b> confine the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out.

5|$|Titan was {{discovered}} on March 25, 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Huygens {{was inspired by}} Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's four largest moons in 1610 and his improvements in telescope technology. Christiaan, {{with the help of}} his brother Constantijn Huygens, Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built. It was the sixth <b>moon</b> <b>to</b> be discovered, after Earth's Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the <b>moon</b> <b>to</b> spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the <b>Moon</b> <b>to</b> coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E

50|$|As with Uranus, the {{low light}} levels cause the major <b>moons</b> <b>to</b> appear very dim. The {{brightness}} of Triton at full phase is only −7.11, {{despite the fact}} that Triton is more than 4 times as intrinsically bright as our moon and orbits much closer to Neptune.|$|R
