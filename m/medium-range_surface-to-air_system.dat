40|$|To {{solve the}} {{limitations}} of the test scope, test period, and budget, we have been adapting Modeling and Simulation (M&S) techniques for Test and Evaluation (T&E) of the state-of-the-art weapon systems. This paper describes the Real-time Distributed Simulation Environment (RDSE) for the Korea’s <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>system</b> (Chelmae-II). The RDSE will be used to support the test bed and performance analysis tools for the Chelmae-II system. To develop the RDSE, this paper proposes the Air Defense Simulation Framework (ADSF) which supports the High Level Architecture (HLA) and the TCP/IP as well as a real-time simulation engine. An ADSF was successfully applied to the RDSE, and a satisfied test result was acquired through the Global Positioning System (GPS) timer...|$|R
5000|$|HMS Kent was a batch-1 [...] {{destroyer}} of the Royal Navy. She and {{her sisters}} were equipped with the Sea Slug Mk-1 <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile SAM <b>system,</b> along with the short-range Sea Cat SAM, two twin 4.5-inch gun turrets, two single 20mm cannon, ASW torpedo tubes, and a platform and hangar that allowed her to operate one Wessex helicopter. The County class were large ships, with good seakeeping abilities and long range, and were ideal blue-water ships for their time.|$|R
5000|$|Akash (Sanskrit: आकाश Ākāś [...] "Sky") is a <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> {{missile defence}} <b>system</b> {{developed}} by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and supported by Ordnance Factories Board and Bharat Electronics (BEL) in India. The missile system can target aircraft up to 30 km away, at altitudes up to 18,000 m. A pre-fragmented warhead could potentially give the missile the capability to destroy both aircraft and warheads from ballistic missiles. It is in operational service with the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force.|$|R
50|$|Airborne threats can be countered {{in several}} ways. One is air supremacy. This {{is what the}} United States relies on most, which is {{demonstrated}} by their distinct lack of effective short-range, mobile air defence vehicles to accompany armoured units. Most other countries accompany their armoured forces with highly mobile self-propelled anti-aircraft guns such as the German Gepard or the Soviet 9K22 Tunguska, short and <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>systems</b> such as the SA-6, SA-8 and SA-11, or combine both on the same vehicle (the Tunguska for example can also host SA-19 SAM missiles). The usage of anti-aircraft rounds fired from the main gun of a tank has been increasing over the years. An example is the HE-FRAG round from the T-90 which can be detonated at a set distance as determined by its laser range finder.|$|R
50|$|Type 03 <b>Medium-Range</b> <b>Surface-to-Air</b> Missile (maru-san-shiki-chu-kyori-ti-tai-kuu-yuudou-dan) or SAM-4 or Chu-SAM (Chū-Samu) is a Japanese {{developed}} <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>system</b> {{currently in}} service with the Japan Army as JGSDF.

50|$|Nevertheless, the CGN-38-class cruisers, {{with their}} missile {{magazines}} and Mk-26 missile launchers, were incapable of carrying the SM-2ER long-range surface-to-air missile, being {{restricted to the}} SM-2MR <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile. This was a significant limitation in their capabilities. Another weakness was the loss of LAMPS helicopters, due to the installation of Tomahawk cruise missile launchers.|$|R
50|$|Akash (Sanskrit: आकाश meaning Sky) is a <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile {{developed}} {{as part of}} India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme to achieve self-sufficiency {{in the area of}} surface-to-air missiles. It is the most expensive missile project ever undertaken by the Union government in the 20th century. Development costs skyrocketed to almost 120 million, which is far more than other similar systems.|$|R
50|$|The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile. It was {{designed}} to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave semi-active radar homing guidance system.|$|R
50|$|The RIM-66 Standard MR (SM-1MR/SM-2MR) is a <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile (SAM), with a {{secondary}} role as anti-ship missile, originally {{developed for the}} United States Navy (USN). The SM-1 was developed {{as a replacement for}} the RIM-2 Terrier and RIM-24 Tartar that were deployed in the 1950s on a variety of USN ships. The RIM-67 Standard (SM-1ER/SM-2ER) is an extended range version of this missile with a solid rocket booster stage.|$|R
5000|$|All four vessels were {{decommissioned}} {{as part of}} {{the early}} 1990s [...] "peace dividend" [...] after the Cold War ended. The early retirement of the Virginia-class cruisers has been criticized by some. They were new, modern ships; given a New Threat Upgrade electronics overhaul, they would have been well-suited to modern threats. They had rapid-fire Mk 26 launchers that could fire the powerful Standard SM-2MR <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile—earlier decommissioned cruisers used the slower-firing Mk-10 launchers, which required manual fitting of the missiles' fins prior to launch.|$|R
5000|$|Barak-8 is a {{long-range}} anti-air and anti-missile naval defence system being developed jointly by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India. The Indian Army is considering induction of {{a variant of}} Barak 8 missile to meet its requirement for a <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> air defence missile. The naval version of this missile will {{have the capability to}} intercept incoming enemy cruise missiles and combat jets targeting its warships at sea. [...] India has a joint venture for this missile with Israel.|$|R
50|$|A Mk 13 missile {{launcher}} for the American Standard SM-1 <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missile (SAM) (with a 40-missile magazine) replaced the helicopter hangar and {{deck of the}} Kortenaers. This was supplemented by an eight round Mk 29 NATO Sea Sparrow short range SAM launcher forward, with 24 missiles carried. A Goalkeeper close-in weapon system was mounted aft, while the forward-mounted OTO Melara 76 mm gun of the Kortenaers was omitted. Launchers for eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles were positioned amidships, while anti-submarine armament consisted of four tubes for Mark 46 torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|In June 2007, India {{signed a}} $250 million to {{purchase}} SPYDER (Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby) mobile air defence missiles from Israel. The two countries signed an additional $4 billion {{deal for the}} joint development of a <b>medium-range</b> <b>surface-to-air</b> missiles. However, the procurement of SPYDER missiles was delayed because of an ongoing investigation against Israel Aerospace Industries and RAFAEL by Indian intelligence agencies for its alleged kickbacks in the Barak-I deal with the Indian Navy. In August 2008, a $2.5 billion deal was signed by India and Israel to develop an advanced version of the SPYDER.|$|R
