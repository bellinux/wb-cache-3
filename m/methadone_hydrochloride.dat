40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine if {{administration}} of the μ-opiate agonist <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> resulted in deficits in performance on the Morris water tank task, a widely used test of spatial cognition. To this end, after initial training on the task, Long-Evans rats were administered saline or methadone at either 1. 25, 2. 5 or 5 mg/kg ip 15 min prior to testing. The performance of the highest-dose methadone group was inferior to that of the controls on the working memory version of the Morris task. There were also differences between the groups on the reference memory version of the task, but this result cannot be considered reliable.

40|$|<b>Methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is an effective, inexpensive, and {{relatively}} safe opioid {{to use in}} the management of pain during the final stages of life. In single dose studies methadone is only marginally more potent than morphine; however, with repeated administration it is several times more potent. Methadone is a significant clinical alternative to morphine, but its safe administration requires knowledge of its pharmacology and experience. The plasma half life of methadone is long, averaging approximately 24 hours (with a range from 13 to over 100 hours) but most patients require dosing at intervals of 4 – 8 hours. This discrepancy between plasma half life and duration of effect may place patients at increased risk of drug accumulation when treatment is initiated or the dose increased. Sedation, confusion and even death can occur if patients are not carefully monitored. KEY POINTS 1. Methadone should only be prescribed by or in conjunction with a doctor experienced in pain management or Palliative Care. 2. In the opioid naïve woman, initial doses must be titrated carefully and the woman must be supervised closely until there is reasonable certainty that a steady state plasma concentration has been approached (approximately 1 week) ...|$|E
40|$|Almost 3 million Americans have abused heroin. The most {{effective}} treatment for this concerning epidemic is opioid replacement therapy. Although, from a historical perspective, acceptance of this therapy has been slow, growing evidence supports its efficacy. There are 3 approved medications for opioid maintenance therapy: <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> levomethadyl acetate, and buprenorphine hydrochloride. Each has unique characteristics that determine its suitability {{for an individual}} patient. Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported with methadone and levomethadyl, but not with buprenorphine. Due to concerns about cardiac risk, levomethadyl use has declined and the product may ultimately be discontinued.

40|$|Substitute {{methadone}} prescribing {{is one of}} {{the main}} modes of treatment for opioid dependence with established evidence for improved health and social outcomes. However, the pharmacology underpinning the effects of methadone is little studied despite controversies about dosing in relation to outcome. We therefore examined the relationship between methadone dose and occupation of opioid receptors in brain using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C- 11] diprenorphine in humans and rats. Eight opioid-dependent subjects stable on their substitute methadone (18 - 90 mg daily) had an [C- 11] diprenorphine PET scan at predicted peak plasma levels of methadone. These were compared with eight healthy controls. No difference in [C- 11] diprenorphine binding was found between the groups, with no relationship between methadone dose and occupancy. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been given an acute i. v. injection of <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (0. 35, 0. 5, 0. 7, or 1. 0 mg kg(- 1)) before [C- 11] diprenorphine showed a dose-dependent increase in biodistribution but no reduction in [C- 11] diprenorphine binding. We suggest that the lack of a dose-dependent relationship between methadone dose, either given chronically in human or acutely in rat, and occupancy of opioid receptor measured with [C- 11] diprenorphine PET is related to efficacy of this opioid agonist at very low levels of opioid receptor occupancy. This has implications for understanding the actions of methadone in comparison with other opioid drugs such as partial agonists and antagonists...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of oral and injectable formulations of methadone after IV, oral, and intragastric administration in horses. ANIMALS: 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES: Horses received single doses (each 0. 15 mg/kg) of an oral formulation of <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> orally or intragastrically or an injectable {{formulation of the}} drug orally, intragastrically, or IV (5 experimental treatments/horse; 2 -week washout period between each experimental treatment). A blood sample was collected from each horse before and at predetermined time points over a 360 -minute period after each administration of the drug to determine serum drug concentration by use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters by use of a noncompartmental model. Horses were monitored for adverse effects. RESULTS: In treated horses, serum methadone concentrations were equivalent to or higher than the effective concentration range reported for humans, without induction of adverse effects. Oral pharmacokinetics in horses included a short half-life (approx 1 hour), high total body clearance corrected for bioavailability (5 to 8 mL/min/kg), and small apparent volume of distribution corrected for bioavailability (0. 6 to 0. 9 L/kg). The bioavailability of methadone administered orally was approximately 3 times that associated with intragastric administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Absorption of methadone in the small intestine in horses appeared to be limited owing to the low bioavailability after intragastric administration. Better understanding of drug disposition, including absorption, {{could lead to a}} more appropriate choice of administration route that would enhance analgesia and minimize adverse effects in horses...|$|E

Conversely, inhi-bition may decrease clearance, leading to methadone toxicity and increasing the risk of death due to respiratory depres-sion and cardiac arrest. Toxicity may oc-cur at seemingly therapeutic plasma con-centrations resulting from slow accumu-lation of active metabolites and complex metabolism involving a large number of CYP isoenzymes. 6 Close monitoring is recommended during initiation and dose titration of methadone therapy. 2 The degree to which CYP 1 A 2 influences the metabo-lism of methadone is poorly characterized and is of particu-lar interest in the evaluation of patients who smoke and re-ceive chronic methadone therapy.

40|$|Chronic pain, {{one of the}} mostcommon {{conditions}} for which people seek medical treatment, affects more than 85 million Americans. 1 In end-of-life care, in which the primary focus is a reduction or elimination of suffering, many patients still endure uncontrolled pain. In recent years, healthcare consumers have become more sophisticated, demanding better pain control. Thus, physicians need to be familiar and competent with various treatment options including pharma-cotherapy to manage their patients’ chronic pain. Although the primary responsibility of physicians is to nurture the physical and psychological well-being of their patients, {{it is also important}} that they serve as stewards of financial resources. A resurgence in the understanding of pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> coupled with its low cost has led to increased use of this agent in manage-ment of chronic pain. Methadone, a synthetic opioid ago-nist developed in the late 1940 s, has been used for more than 40 years to treat patients who are addicted to narcotics. Although substantial information exists regarding such use of methadone, only limited data are available with respect to pain management. It is only within the past decade {{that there has been a}} renewed focus on its use in treatment of patients with chronic pain. The National Guideline Clearinghouse guideline titled “VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of opioid therapy for chronic pain” 2 recommends use of an agent with a long duration of action, such as a controlled-release morphine or methadone, when initiating a trial of opioid therapy for continuous pain. Initial interest in methadone for pain management emerged in caring for ter-minally ill cancer patients, but recent attention now includes management of nonmalignant pain. Methadone is achieving greater acceptance in end-of-life care because it is the sole long-acting opioid in liquid form. It is highly lipophilic and readily absorbed through buccal mucosa.

The present study was to investigate by measuring the antinociceptive effect on rats whether the opioid analgesic methadone could be delivered and targeted to the brain by transcranial delivery route. A non aqueous solution of methadone base in sesame oil was used for the application on the scalp. Animal studies were carried out using six groups of male rats consisting of group 1, the oral control treated with distilled water 1 ml; group 2, the oral positive control treated with <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> solution 316. 5 &# 956;g/ml; group 3, the negative control treated transcranially with the blank sesame oil 0. 2 ml and three test groups 4, 5 and 6 treated with three different dose levels of the transcranial oil formulation of methadone base, 41. 6 &# 956;g/ 0. 2 ml, 104 &# 956;g/ 0. 2 ml and 208 &# 956;g/ 0. 2 ml, respectively.

Aim: To build a one-dimensional (1 -D), hollow-fiber geometry, ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equation (PDE) countercurrent hemodialyzer model (ODE/PDE model). Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study in silico that evaluated eleven hemodialysis patients. Patients received a ceiling dose of <b>methadone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> 30 mg/day. Outcome measures included: the total amount of methadone removed during dialysis; methadone’s overall intradialytic mass transfer rate coefficient, km; and, methadone’s removal rate, jME. Each metric was measured at dialysate flow rates of 250 mL/min and 800 mL/min. Results: The ODE/PDE model revealed {{a significant increase in the}} change of methadone’s mass transfer with increased dialysate flow rate, %Δ km= 18. 56, P= 0. 02, N= 11. The total amount of methadone mass transferred across the dialyzer membrane with high dialysate flow rate significantly increased (0. 042 ± 0. 016 versus 0. 052 ± 0. 019 mg/kg, P= 0. 02, N= 11). This was accompanied by a small significant increase in methadone’s mass transfer rate (0. 113 ± 0. 002 versus 0. 014 ± 0. 002 mg/kg/h, P= 0. 02, N= 11). The ODE/PDE model accurately predicted methadone’s removal during dialysis. The absolute value of the prediction errors for methadone&# 39;s extraction and throughput were less than 2 %. Conclusion: ODE/PDE modeling of methadone’s hemodialysis is a new approach to study methadone’s removal, in particular, and opioid removal, in general, in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. ODE/PDE modeling accurately quantified the fundamental phenomena of methadone’s mass transfer during hemodialysis. This methodology may lead to development of optimally designed intradialytic opioid treatment protocols, and allow dynamic monitoring of outflow plasma opioid concentrations for model predictive control during dialysis in humans.
