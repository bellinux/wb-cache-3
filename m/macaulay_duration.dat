40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the price {{sensitivity}} of fixed-income securities to the interest rate changes, expressing a dominant source of financial risk the financial institutions or other market participants manage. The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the <b>Macaulay's</b> <b>duration</b> normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as weighted average maturity of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the bond redemption prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fun- damental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the scheduled principal payment date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's dura- tion approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities...|$|R

50|$|Modified duration, on {{the other}} hand, is a {{derivative}} (rate of change) of price and measures the percentage rate of change of price with respect to yield. (Price sensitivity with respect to yields can also be measured in absolute (dollar or euro, etc.) terms, and the absolute sensitivity {{is often referred to}} as dollar (euro) duration, DV01, BPV, or delta (δ or Δ) risk). The concept of modified duration can be applied to interest-rate sensitive instruments with non-fixed cash flows, and can thus be applied to a wider range of instruments than can <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration.</b> Modified duration is used more often than <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For {{a set of}} all-positive fixed {{cash flows}} the {{weighted}} average will fall between 0 (the minimum time), or more precisely [...] (the time to the first payment) {{and the time of}} the final cash flow.

5000|$|For every-day use, the {{equality}} (or near-equality) {{of the values}} for Macaulay and modified duration can be a useful aid to intuition. For example a standard ten-year coupon bond will have <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> somewhat but not dramatically less than 10 years and from this we can infer that the modified duration (price sensitivity) will also be somewhat but not dramatically less than 10%. Similarly, a two-year coupon bond will have <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> somewhat below 2 years, and modified duration somewhat below 2%. (For example a ten-year 5% par bond has a modified duration of 7.8% while a two-year 5% par bond has a modified duration of 1.9%.) ...|$|E
50|$|Modified {{duration}} {{measures the}} size of the interest rate sensitivity. Sometimes we can be misled into thinking that it measures which part of the yield curve the instrument is sensitive to. After all, the modified duration (% change in price) is almost the same number as the <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> (a kind of weighted average years to maturity). For example, the annuity above has <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> of 4.8 years and we might think that it is sensitive to the 5-year yield. But it has a cash flows out to 10 years and thus will be sensitive to 10-year yields. If we want to measure sensitivity to parts of the yield curve we need to consider key rate durations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macaulay</b> <b>Duration</b> only {{measures}} fixed period cash flows, Weighted Average Life {{factors in}} all principal cash flows {{whether they be}} in fixed or floating. Thus for Fixed Period Hybrid ARM mortgages, for modeling purposes, the entire fixed period ends on {{the date of the}} last fixed payment or the month prior to reset.|$|E
50|$|Modified {{duration}} can {{be extended}} to instruments with non-fixed cash flows, while <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> applies only to fixed cash flow instruments. Modified duration {{is defined as the}} logarithmic derivative of price with respect to yield, and such a definition will apply to instruments that depend on yields, whether or not the cash flows are fixed.|$|E
50|$|Modified {{duration}} can {{be expressed}} as the percent change in price per one percentage point change in yield per year (for example yield going from 8% per year (y = 0.08) to 9% per year (y = 0.09)). This will give modified duration a value close to the <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> (and equal when rates are continuously compounded).|$|E
50|$|Thus {{modified}} duration is approximately {{equal to the}} percentage change in price for a given finite change in yield. So a 15-year bond with a <b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> of 7 years would have a Modified duration of roughly 7 years and would fall approximately 7% in value if the interest rate increased by one percentage point (say from 7% to 8%).|$|E

5000|$|The {{dual use}} of the word [...] "duration", as both the {{weighted}} average time until repayment and as the percentage change in price, often causes confusion.

40|$|<b>Macaulay</b> <b>duration</b> {{has often}} {{been used as a}} measure of the bond prices {{sensitivity}} to changes in interest rates. For a small change in interest rates, the duration provides a good approximation of the actual change in price. As the change in interest rates gets larger, the duration approximation has larger errors. The convexity of bond prices change is often used as a way to improve the accuracy of the approximation. Several authors have pointed out that the natural logarithm of bond price is a better measure of percentage changes in bond prices as interest rates change. Based on this idea, this paper derives an accurate method of estimating percentage bond price changes in response to changes in interest rates, which is called exponential duration.
