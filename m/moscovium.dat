5|$|<b>Moscovium</b> is an {{extremely}} radioactive element: its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.8seconds. In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth. <b>Moscovium</b> is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and to be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. About 100 atoms of <b>moscovium</b> have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moscovium</b> is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that <b>moscovium</b> will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, <b>moscovium</b> will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving <b>moscovium</b> some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and <b>moscovium</b> may be considered to have only three valence electrons. <b>Moscovium</b> would be quite a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of <b>moscovium</b> fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of <b>moscovium</b> should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. <b>Moscovium</b> and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. <b>Moscovium</b> should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like <b>moscovium</b> atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Two heavier {{isotopes}} of <b>moscovium,</b> 289Mc and 290Mc, {{were discovered}} in 2009–2010 as daughters of the tennessine isotopes 293Ts and 294Ts; the isotope 289Mc was later also synthesized directly and confirmed {{to have the same}} properties as found in the tennessine experiments. The JINR also has plans to study lighter isotopes of <b>moscovium</b> in 2017 by replacing the americium-243 target with the lighter isotope americium-241.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of <b>moscovium</b> has yet to have been established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and <b>moscovium</b> isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. However, the targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively <b>moscovium</b> and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850°C through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 {{would be expected to}} be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. However, <b>moscovium</b> and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future. Though no known isotopes of livermorium are sufficiently long-lived, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E

5|$|As of 2016, the {{periodic}} table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), <b>moscovium</b> (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Russian discoverers {{reported}} their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers {{of a new}} element {{have the right to}} suggest a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: flyorium, in honor of Georgy Flyorov, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and moskovium, in recognition of the Moscow Oblast where Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result. These names were later proposed for element 114 (flerovium) and element 116 (<b>moscovium).</b> However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead livermorium, and the name <b>moscovium</b> was later proposed and accepted for element 115 instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} identities of {{metalloids}} {{depend on what}} classification criteria are used. Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, <b>moscovium</b> and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moscovium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Mc and atomic number 115. It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American {{scientists at the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. In December 2015, it was {{recognized as one of}} four new elements by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. On 28 November 2016, it was officially named after the Moscow region, which the JINR is situated in.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>moscovium</b> {{in aqueous solution}} should essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) should be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) should be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and thiocyanate (McSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ should be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence should also be {{an important part of}} <b>moscovium</b> chemistry, although its closest homolog among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth. Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of <b>moscovium</b> and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for <b>moscovium</b> and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, <b>moscovium,</b> tennessine, and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), <b>moscovium</b> (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha decay, and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in spontaneous fission at <b>moscovium,</b> tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha decay could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha decay chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha decay through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with alpha decay and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E
5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for {{getting closer to}} the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, the use of weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only reachable unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and <b>moscovium</b> synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but {{there is no way to}} synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} {{discovery of}} a new chemical element with atomic number 115 (<b>moscovium)</b> has been confirmed at GSI by researchers from Lund University in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Abrikosov {{distinguishes between}} {{ordinary}} metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies {{than those of}} the transition metals.

500|$|The first {{successful}} synthesis of <b>moscovium</b> was by a joint team of Russian and American scientists in August 2003 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The researchers on February 2, 2004, stated in Physical Review C that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of <b>moscovium.</b> These atoms decayed by emission of alpha-particles to nihonium in about 100milliseconds.Am(48Ca,xn)291−x115|date=2004|journal=Physical Review C|volume=69|issue=2|page=021601|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.69.021601|bibcode=2004PhRvC..69b1601O|display-authors=3|last7=Tsyganov|first7=Yu.|last8=Gulbekian|first8=G.|last9=Bogomolov|first9=S.}}Am(48Ca,xn)291−x115|author=Oganessian|display-authors=etal|journal=JINR preprints |date=2003}} ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Moscovium</b> is {{expected}} {{to be in the middle}} of an island of stability centered on copernicium (element 112) and flerovium (element 114): the reasons for the presence of this island, however, are still not well understood. [...] Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay. Although the known isotopes of <b>moscovium</b> do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability, they can be seen to approach the island as in general, the heavier isotopes are the longer-lived ones.|$|E
500|$|A 2016 {{study from}} Lund University and the GSI {{nevertheless}} cast some {{doubt on the}} syntheses of <b>moscovium</b> and tennessine after the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized these elements as having been discovered in 2009–2010. It found that the decay chains assigned to the isotopes 287Mc and 288Mc were probably internally consistent, with the uncertainty due to the probable insensitivity of the measurements to very short and very long nuclide lifetimes, incorrect assignments of other decay chains from the 243Am+48Ca reaction to different <b>moscovium</b> isotopes, or uncertainty {{in the identification of}} some of the daughters of these <b>moscovium</b> isotopes. On the other hand, the decay chains assigned to 289Mc, the isotope instrumental in the official confirmation of the synthesis of <b>moscovium</b> and tennessine, were found not to be internally consistent. Some subsets of these chains were found to be consistent, suggesting however that their true assignment was to 288Mc, and that their shortness indicated instead new spontaneous fission branches in its daughters 284Nh and 280Rg – or, more likely, undetected electron capture branches in these daughters leading to the even–even nuclides 284Cn and 280Ds, which have a very low barrier to spontaneous fission. While the 294Ts decay chains were found to be congruent, the 293Ts decay chains approved by the JWP were found to probably not be so and require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different tennessine isotopes. It was also found that the set of chains from 293Ts and 289Mc were not congruent. The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticised the IUPAC/IUPAP JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of <b>moscovium</b> and tennessine was an almost certainly non-existent link was [...] "problematic".|$|E
500|$|In the {{periodic}} table, <b>moscovium</b> {{is a member}} of group 15, the pnictogens, below nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Every previous pnictogen has five electrons in its valence shell, forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np3. In moscovium's case, the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p3; therefore, <b>moscovium</b> will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects. However, notable differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to <b>moscovium</b> atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect [...] "tearing" [...] the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to [...] and [...] for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s7p7p. These effects cause moscovium's chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter congeners.|$|E

500|$|The Dubna–Livermore {{collaboration}} strengthened {{their claim}} for {{the discovery of}} nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on 268Db, the final decay product of 288Mc. This was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so that their claim was not supported by any previously obtained experimental data, and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim. In June 2004 and again in December 2005, this dubnium isotope was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring spontaneous fission (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group 5 element (as dubnium {{is known to be}} in group 5 of the periodic table). Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268Db which lends support to the assignment of the parent and daughter nuclei to <b>moscovium</b> and nihonium respectively.Am + 48Ca|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.72.034611|date=2005|author=Oganessian, Yu.

In 1985, a joint experiment between Berkeley and Peter Armbruster's team at GSI, the result was again negative with a calculated cross-section limit of 10–100pb. Work on reactions with 48Ca, which had proved very useful in the synthesis of nobelium from the natPb+48Ca reaction, nevertheless continued at Dubna, with a superheavy element separator being developed in 1989, a search for target materials and starting of collaborations with LLNL being started in 1990, production of more intense 48Ca beams being started in 1996, and preparations for long-term experiments with three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity being performed in the early 1990s. This work led directly {{to the production of}} new isotopes of elements 112 to 118 in the reactions of 48Ca with actinide targets and the discovery of the five heaviest elements on the periodic table: flerovium, <b>moscovium,</b> livermorium, tennessine, and oganesson.Ca with 248Cm in the Bombarding Energy Range of 4.5–5.2MeV/u |year=1985 |last=Armbruster |first=P. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=54 |pages=406–409 |pmid=10031507 |last2=Agarwal |first2=YK |last3=Brüchle |first3=W |last4=Brügger |first4=M |last5=Dufour |first5=JP |last6=Gaggeler |first6=H |last7=Hessberger |first7=FP |last8=Hofmann |first8=S |last9=Lemmertz |first9=P |last10=Münzenberg |first10=G. |last11=Poppensieker |first11=K. |last12=Reisdorf |first12=W. |last13=Schädel |first13=M. |last14=Schmidt |first14=K. |last15=Schneider |first15=J. |last16=Schneider |first16=W. |last17=Sümmerer |first17=K. |last18=Vermeulen |first18=D. |last19=Wirth |first19=G. |last20=Ghiorso |first20=A. |last21=Gregorich |first21=K. |last22=Lee |first22=D. |last23=Leino |first23=M. |last24=Moody |first24=K. |last25=Seaborg |first25=G. |last26=Welch |first26=R. |last27=Wilmarth |first27=P. |last28=Yashita |first28=S. |last29=Frink |first29=C. |last30=Greulich |first30=N. |issue=5 |bibcode=1985PhRvL..54..406A |display-authors=8}} ...|$|E
