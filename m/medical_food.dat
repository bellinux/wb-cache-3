Are <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> components of supportive care or should they be considered pharmacologic treat-ment? To date, the US Congress has defined <b>medical</b> <b>foods,</b> but the Food and Drug Administration has not developed regulatory statutes for them beyond those designed to ensure the sanitary manufacture of all pro-cessed foods.

Four-day diet records were computer-analyzed and the contribution of <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> and natural foods to the total diets of the patients was determined. A fasting blood sample and two 24 -hour urine collections were obtained from each subject. In eight patients consuming a strict diet, natural foods provided 0. 9 g protein and 39 mg phenylalanine (phe) / 100 calories, a significant reduction from control intakes of 3. 3 g protein and 153 mg phe/ 100 calories.

40|$|PURPOSE: Cobalamin C (cblC) {{deficiency}} impairs the biosynthesis of 5 '-deoxyadenosyl-adenosyl- and methyl-cobalamin, {{resulting in}} methylmalonic acidemia combined with hyperhomocysteinemia and hypomethioninemia. However, some patients with cblC deficiency {{are treated with}} <b>medical</b> <b>foods,</b> devoid of methionine and high in leucine content, that are formulated for patients with isolated propionate oxidative defects. We {{examined the effects of}} imbalanced branched-chain amino acid intake on growth outcomes in cblC-deficient patients. METHODS: Dietary intake was correlated with biochemical, anthropometric, and body composition measurements and other disease parameters in a cohort of 28 patients with early-onset cblC deficiency. RESULTS: Protein-restricted diets were followed by 21 % of the patients, whereas 32 % received <b>medical</b> <b>foods.</b> Patients on protein-restricted diets had lower height-for-age z-score (P = 0. 034), whereas patients consuming <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> had lower head circumference Z-scores (P = 0. 037), plasma methionine concentrations (P = 0. 001), and predicted methionine influx through the blood-brain barrier Z-score (- 1. 29 vs. - 0. 0617; P = 0. 007). The combination of age at diagnosis, a history of seizures, and the leucine-to-valine dietary intake ratio best predicted head circumference Z-score based on multiple regression modeling (R(2) = 0. 945). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cblC deficiency treated with <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> designed for isolated methylmalonic acidemia are at risk for iatrogenic methionine deficiency that could adversely affect brain growth and development.

On {{the hypothesis that}} poor palatability, volume and frequency of drug/formula administration contribute to treatment non-adherence and hyperammonemic episodes, a survey was conducted of patient, caregiver (CG) and physician perspectives on treatments used in urea cycle disorders (UCD). Methods: A paper and online survey assessed experience with UCD medications, <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> and dietary supplements. Results: 25 physicians, 52 adult patients and 114 CG responded. In 2009, the most common UCD-specific intervention reported by patients included sodium phenylbutyrate (60 %), followed by l-citrulline (46 %), amino acid <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> (15 %), l-arginine preparations (18 %), and sodium benzoate (8 %). Only 36 % of patients reported experiencing no hyperammonemic episodes in the last 2  years. The most commonly reported cause of hyperammonemic episodes was infection or other acute illnesses, followed by dietary indiscretion, side effects of medications, and drug non-adherence. Most patients, caregivers and physicians (> 75 %) ranked nitrogen-scavenging medications, l-citrulline, l-arginine, and <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> as “effective” or “very effective. ” Non-adherence was common (e. g. 18 % of patients admitted to missing sodium phenylbutyrate “at least once a week” and “at least one a day”). Barriers to adherence included taste of medications, frequency of drug administration, number of pills, difficulty swallowing pills, side effects, forgetting to take medications, and high cost. Strategies to mitigate the gastrointestinal side effects of medications included the use of gastric tubes and acid reflux medications. Physicians indicated that 25 % and 33 % of pediatric and adult patients, respectively, were given less than the recommended dose of sodium phenylbutyrate due to concerns of tolerance, administration, and cost. Conclusions: Despite positive views of their effectiveness, respondents found medications, <b>medical</b> <b>foods</b> and dietary supplements difficult to take and viewed adherence as inadequate, thus contributing to hyperammonemic episodes...|$|R
