5|$|Brady was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836, when he was about twenty years old. His first case was an insurance proceeding, where he opposed the prominent lawyer, Charles O'Connor.

Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E

5|$|Improvements {{in public}} schools were the {{hallmark}} of Carroll's term. Using <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> coal severance tax enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes. He strengthened the Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks. A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings. Vocational and special education were expanded, and a program for {{gifted and talented students}} was piloted. Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from 46th to 38th nationally in teacher salaries.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's actual value. The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E

She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor.

5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E

5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon the Splash Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E
