40|$|Interrelations among twenty definitions-descriptions for {{information}} literacy concept: <b>macro-definition</b> proposal ******** In recent years, {{one of the}} concepts with more popularity {{in the field of}} librarianship, documentation and information science is the information literacy. This boom has produced a multiplicity of definitions-descriptions trying to conceptualize it. This article analyzes twenty of the most used definitions-descriptions {{in the past two decades}} integrating them for such analysis, techniques discursive, of domain analysis, and especially, of statistical analysis, networks and information visualization, to identify the trends and interrelationships among the terms utilized in them and its authors, and finally, for the self-evaluation of one proposal of macro definition-description of this concept, which embraces all of these trends and interrelationships and to serve as a guide for the design of different information literacy activities-programs having present all the reach that this implies in the learning throughout life...|$|E

40|$|The report {{describes}} the development, structure, data flow {{and application of}} the flexible, experimental air control simulation system EnCoRe-Plus (En-route Controller's Representation-Programmierbare LUftraumSimulation). The system allows cognitive psychological experiments for investigation of the mental information processing of air-route controllers. A comprehensive appendix documents {{the structure of the}} object-oriented, in C++ written program system. All classes, functions, constants, <b>macro-definitions</b> and variables are listed separately corresponding to the specific source file. A special appendix is devoted to the protocol data representing the development phase and aspects of application.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of spatial regulations {{has become a}} mainstay in fisheries management. These regulations have generated a sizable economics literature focused on the spatial behavior of fishermen. Fundamental to these studies is the consideration set (spatial alternatives) assumed by the researcher to be possessed by the decision agent. Often times this consideration set {{is assumed to be}} the entire spatial extent of the fishery. This research proposes the use of finite mixture modeling to endogenously estimate the formation of consideration sets and the method is applied to a unique spatial decision environment, the Atka mackerel fishery in the Aleutian Islands. Consideration sets are modeled using different <b>macro-definitions</b> of spatial regions to focus the micro-level spatial decision making within the fishery and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative macro-level spatial definitions. Results illustrate the biases associated with traditional consideration set assumptions by estimating fishermen's valuations for different high-value sites within the Aleutian Islands under alternative consideration set assumptions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how a model that assumes some structure on potential consideration sets reduces the dimensionality problems associated with other endogenous approaches to choice set definition.
