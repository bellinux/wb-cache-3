5|$|Early in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks {{along the}} Italian coast {{prompted}} Dubourdieu {{to mount a}} second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of Montagu, Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga. The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot. Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|As British {{forces on}} the {{southeast}} coast of Britain regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend {{with the intention of}} blocking the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18U-boats and 25destroyers present for <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Volunteers from among the force that had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on their experience on the previous operation. Among these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of , Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of , and Brilliants first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port. Other officers came forward to participate and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once again.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{met with}} Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who {{had built the}} China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and {{it was agreed that}} Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 1915 the {{division}} {{was ordered to}} Egypt, and 137th Brigade arrived there by 13 January.

25|$|While it {{took the}} band three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with a title for their last album, Object 47, they almost {{immediately}} agreed on naming the current record Red Barked Tree. According to Lewis, the cover artwork by Jon Wozencroft – based on a photograph showing a detail of an untitled work by Arte Povera artist Jannis Kounellis – reflects the idea of alchemy as a quest for knowledge.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1945, Groves and Parsons flew to Pasadena, California, {{where they}} met with Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who had built the China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and {{it was agreed that}} Caltech would build and operate the pilot plant for the {{manufacture}} of the non-nuclear explosives used in the atomic bomb.

25|$|The {{planning}} for Operation K {{began in the}} weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the Imperial Japanese Navy high command considered how {{to take advantage of the}} capabilities of the long-range Kawanishi H8K flying boats. Plans to bomb California and Texas were being discussed, when the need for updated information regarding the repairs to US Navy facilities at Pearl Harbor took precedence. An assessment of the repairs to the docks, yards and airfields of Oahu would help the IJN staff to determine American ability to project power for <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|Grumium arrived Pearl Harbor 30 June, and 10 July, {{continued}} to Roi Island. Arriving 19 July, the ship transferred supplies to aircraft groups until early September, {{then returned to}} Pearl Harbor. She sailed with another load of aviation supplies 28 September, calling at Ulithi and Eniwetok before arriving at Manus on 17 November. There she supplied carrier forces making the supporting strikes for the Philippine campaign, as America’s great island offensive gained momentum. Remaining at Manus until 5 December 1944, Grumium sailed to a closer advance base, Ulithi, arriving four days later. From Ulithi the ship supported the far reaching air raids on the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa in the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it.

I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me.

25|$|In the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> he was {{reported}} to be on the wish lists of many top European clubs; his former All Black's teammate Andrew Mehrtens was forced to publicly deny rumours that Umaga was a target of his club at the time – Harlequins. Umaga eventually signed for French club Toulon that had been recently relegated from the Top 14 to Pro D2. His contract allowed him to play the entire 2006 Air New Zealand Cup (ANZ Cup) season for Wellington before travelling to France. He ended up playing only seven matches for Toulon as Wellington made the ANZ Cup final. He nonetheless made roughly €350,000 (US$438,000/GBP 250,000) that Toulon's co-presidents reportedly paid out of their own pockets. The day before playing his first match for Toulon he was awarded the medal of honour of the city of Toulon (médaille d'or de la ville) by Mayor Hubert Falco. On 29 October 2006, Umaga started in his first game three days after arriving in Toulon scoring his team's only try in a 22–16 victory against Lyon. He was surprised to see how close to the players the fans were and how noisy the atmosphere was.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} never finished, and its {{structures}} were looted in 1941. As a result, {{it was in}} poor shape when the first prisoners arrived, and the situation would deteriorate further in the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> when the camp came under German control. The camp had a roughly rectangular shape, surrounded by a triple barbed wire fence, with guard towers at every 200 m. The camp's gate was {{on the western side}} of the fence. Most buildings were clustered on the northern half of the camp. Blocks 1 to 4 were located there, built in a staggered line towards the East. These were two-storey barracks buildings, divided in two equal but separate sections, western and eastern, with separate entrances to each. In addition, the north-eastern corner housed storage houses, the mess hall, the baths (Block 16), where the women's solitary confinement cells were also located, the workshops (Block 21) and the camp headquarters (Block 20). The infamous Block 15, located to the east of the headquarters, was the solitary confinement facility, with the camp guard's quarters and mess room. In the south-eastern corner there was the isolated women's wing (Block 6). Under the Germans, the first floor housed Jewish women, while the second floor was reserved for Christians. In total, over 300 Christian and 2,500 Jewish women passed through Haidari beginning on 7 December 1943, including heroines of the Resistance such as Iro Konstantopoulou or Lela Karagianni (executed on 5 and 8 September 1944 respectively).|$|E

You know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs.

60|$|Having {{made this}} {{calculation}} {{as to the}} time I {{had to do it}} in, I set seriously about the job of making provisions with my raft. In one or two particulars, I could not much improve the latter; for, the yards lying underneath the masts, it rendered the last as buoyant as was desirable in moderate weather. It struck me, however, that by getting the top-gallant and royal masts, with their yards, in, around the top, I might rig a staging, with the aid of the hatches, that would not only keep me entirely out of water, in mild weather, but which would contain all one man could consume, in the way of victuals and drink, for a <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>To</b> this object, then, I next gave my attention.|$|R

500|$|By late 1972, Genesis had stabilised around Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett and Phil Collins. The {{group had}} been {{regularly}} touring, achieved commercial success with their previous album Foxtrot, and {{were starting to}} gig in the U.S., particularly in New York City, where they had a positive response. However, journalists were still criticising the band and comparing them to other progressive rock bands such as ELP, Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd. The group were too busy touring to write new material, so after coming off the road in spring 1973 they set aside time to create new songs. The group's record company, Charisma Records insisted they had three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{up with a new}} album, which Rutherford considered [...] "the kiss of death". Collins formed a pick up band with former Yes guitarist Peter Banks for a few gigs, and Rutherford revealed in an interview to Sounds in 1976 that [...] "there had been worries that Phil might want to leave the group".|$|E
500|$|The {{plan was}} similar to the failed {{operation}} of three weeks previously. Weather dependent, under cover of a smoke screen, aerial bombardment and offshore artillery, the blockships would steam directly into the channel, turn sideways and scuttle themselves. Their advance would be covered by artillery fire against German shore positions from the heavy monitors at distance and at closer range by gunfire from the destroyers. This cover was vital because Ostend was protected by a very strong [...] gun position known as the Tirpitz battery, named for the admiral. Once the operation had been concluded, the motor launches would draw along the seaward side of the blockships, remove the surviving crews and take them to the monitors for passage back to Britain. This operation was to thoroughly block the channel, and — coupled with the blockage at Zeebrugge (which the British authorities believed to be fully closed) — was to prevent use of Bruges by German raiding craft for <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
500|$|After {{his loss}} to Kofi Kingston, The Miz turned {{face for the}} first time in his career when he joined Mick Foley's team at Survivor Series after confronting Paul Heyman on the November 18 Raw. At Survivor Series, The Miz {{eliminated}} Wade Barrett before being eliminated by Alberto Del Rio. In the <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> Miz's turn was not well received by critics, who commented that Miz as a babyface was too similar to his heel character because he was [...] "still cocky, arrogant, and egotistical" [...] while [...] "pivoted toward calling out established heels". Other criticisms were that Miz was [...] "juvenile", lacking of depth, [...] "grating and not endearing to the audience" [...] and that [...] "there was not that moment when he officially turned and aligned his values with the audience's". The Miz then began a feud with United States Champion Antonio Cesaro, after Cesaro insulted America. During this feud Ric Flair became Miz's mentor, and he subsequently adopted the figure-four leglock from Flair as a new finisher. The Miz challenged for Cesaro's United States Championship at the Royal Rumble pre-show, at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, and on the March 3 episode of SmackDown, but was unsuccessful each time.|$|E
