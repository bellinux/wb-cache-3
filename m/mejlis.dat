The pro-Russian Crimean authorities also banned Mustafa Dzhemilev, a human rights activist, Soviet dissident, member of the Ukrainian parliament, and former Chairman of the <b>Mejlis</b> of the Crimean Tatars from entering Crimea. Additionally, <b>Mejlis</b> reported, that officers of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) raided Tatar homes in the same week, on the pretense of [...] "suspicion of terrorist activity".

The Committee of the Liberation of Muslim Georgia, led by Memed Abashidze and Haidar Abashidze, had repeatedly spoken of the establishment of autonomy on religious principles within the borders of Georgia. To work towards this, on September 13, 1919 a prototype parliament, the <b>Mejlis,</b> was convened in Batum. Though Abashidze's faction strongly advocated the union with Georgia, the drive towards autonomy was strong, even among the pro-Georgian Adjarians. Another, less numerous group known as Seday Mileth (in Turkish: [...] "voice of people") propagated pro- and pan-Turkish ideas.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Mejlis</b> {{was labeled}} an extremist {{organisation}} by Russian authorities in Crimea and {{banned by the}} Russian-appointed supreme court there on 26 April 2016.

The <b>Mejlis</b> was also said to be responsible for stopping all cargo traffic between (mainland) Ukraine and Crimea in the autumn of 2015 and a late November series of explosions that damaged voltage power lines leading to a massive Crimean power outage. The <b>Mejlis</b> denied involvement in these events. (Also on 26 April 2016) Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muižnieks urged the court to reverse the ban since he believed [...] "Equating (the <b>Mejlis)</b> with extremism paves the way for stigmatisation and discrimination of {{a significant part of the}} Crimean Tatar community and sends a negative message to that community as a whole". Exiled in mainland Ukraine, Chairman of the <b>Mejlis</b> Refat Chubarov stated the court's decision was unjustifiable and that [...] "The occupiers in Crimea are doing everything to crush Crimean Tatars and force everyone to be silent". Amnesty International stated the ban “demolishes one of the few remaining rights of a minority that Russia must protect instead of persecute”. Deputy Chairman of the <b>Mejlis</b> Nariman Dzhelal vowed that the organization would try to continue its work despite the ban, saying “it will continue working in Ukraine and other countries”.|$|E
