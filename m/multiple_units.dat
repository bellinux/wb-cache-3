5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> used on Metro-North's New Haven Line, which are also purchased {{in part by the}} state of Connecticut, all SLE trains are diesel push-pull trains.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Hardanger Line used Class 64 {{electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> On 28 March 1940, NSB sent {{an invitation}} to tender for two <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> which {{would be similar to}} Class 64. The company asked both for aluminum and steel bids. However, NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three electric locomotives. The units were intended to be delivered in 1942. The mechanical components and assembly was done by Thune, and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB, except the transformer and electric controllers, which were built by Per Kure.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{sometimes}} also {{used as an}} alternative name for the small types of <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> which consist {{of more than one}} coach.

5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> built to the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also built to fit the loading gauge. The diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single.|$|E
5|$|The Hitachi Rail Italy Driverless Metro is a {{class of}} driverless {{electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and corresponding signaling system. Manufactured by Hitachi Rail Italy (formerly AnsaldoBreda) and Ansaldo STS in Italy, it is or will be used on the Copenhagen Metro, Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University, the Brescia Metro, the Thessaloniki Metro, Line 5 of the Milan Metro, Line C of the Rome Metro and the Yellow Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System. The first system to use this class of driverless electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> was the Copenhagen Metro which opened in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and locomotive hauled trains is 115km/h, with diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> permitted up to 130km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160km/h on specified lines. The maximum axle loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne axle loading operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line. To supplement this, the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> for the Røros and Rauma Lines. The choice fell on Class 93, with fifteen units eventually delivered. This allowed all passenger trains on diselized lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4. The last Di 3-hauled train ran on 7 January 2001.|$|E

To supplement this, on 14 November 1996 the board of NSB decided to purchase seven tilting diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> for the Røros and Rauma Lines. In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired within five years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer Siemens, further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
50|$|An electro-diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> {{is a form}} of {{passenger}} rail car powered either from an electricity supply (like an electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit)</b> or by using the onboard diesel engine (like a diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit).</b> Examples include the Hitachi Class 800 and Class 802, as well as the trains being built by Stadler for Abellio Greater Anglia.|$|R

5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Air France-KLM {{indicated}} {{a desire to}} take advantage of the change in the law and apply to run rail services, in cooperation with Veolia, from London to Paris and from Paris to Amsterdam, in competition with Eurostar and Thalys respectively, with the intention of purchasing or leasing the new AGV <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> currently being tested.|$|E
5|$|Initially, all trains on {{the line}} were hauled by steam locomotives, in {{particular}} NSB Class 20 and NSB Class 21 brought in used from other lines. The first diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were taken into use in the 1930s, with the line seeing the use of both NSB Class Cmb 16 and Kristine Valdresdatter. During World War II, the line was again entirely hauled by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably. By 1945, there were three round trips per week, but after the war ended, the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips. Various classes of <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> have been used, including NSB Class 86, NSB Class 87 and NSB Class 91. During the 1950s, there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli.|$|E

5|$|Ofotbanen Drift AS, trading as Ofotbanen, was a Norwegian {{passenger}} and freight railway company. The company {{operated a}} fleet of six locomotives, three <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> 22 passenger and 48 freight cars. The sole service was the passenger train Unionsexpressen between Oslo and Stockholm; it had previously offered freight haulage on contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} replaced {{in the southeast}} England during the late 1950s and early 1960s due {{to the introduction of}} further electrification, new lightweight standard steam classes, diesel shunters, and diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> By the end of 1963 the majority that remained were based at Bournemouth to work the Swanage branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of British Rail Class 201 diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> to the Hastings route after 1957 and {{the completion of}} the electrification of the South Eastern Main Line in 1961 deprived the class of much of their work. Withdrawals began in January 1961 and the whole class had disappeared from service by December 1962.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> {{and diesel}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> vehicles often utilise a specialised coupler that provides both mechanical, electrical and pneumatic connections between vehicles.

5|$|The vehicle {{procurement}} for eBART includes eight Stadler GTW trains, {{with two}} options to purchase six more. The first {{will be delivered}} in June 2016.

5|$|Vehicles {{weighing}} over 5,000 kilograms {{are divided}} into two categories: Heavy Single Units and Heavy <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units.</b> Heavy Multiple Unit Vehicles will be charged two or three time the passenger rate, {{depending on the size}} of the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5000|$|Ex-Metropolitan Railway {{hauled stock}} {{retained}} their original numbers {{as they did}} not conflict {{with any of the}} numbers allocated to the <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> stock; they were all numbered between 41 and 510 (511-519 were later allocated to cars converted from <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> to hauled stock).|$|R
