Roger puts Peggy in charge of hiring a new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition.

5|$|A third theory, {{supported}} by both Serbian and Bulgarian researchers, is that despot <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> an unknown son of Michael Asen IV, the first-born son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371), who was proclaimed co-tsar {{shortly after his}} father's accession and died in a battle against the Ottomans before 1354–1355. Against this identification is the account of Nikephoros Gregoras, who mentions that Michael Asen's widow returned childless to Constantinople after his death. Another issue with this theory is that no source mentions Michael Asen as a despot.|$|E

Shortly after, the two notice a shark is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E
5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early Serbian historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in Serbian scholarship, is that despot <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in the portraits are uncommon for this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century Serbian architecture. It has also been revealed that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the Serbian Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E

Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. <b>Michael</b> <b>is</b> shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael.
