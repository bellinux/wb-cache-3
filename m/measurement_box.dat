40|$|The photon box thought {{experiment}} can {{be considered}} a forerunner of the EPR-experiment: by performing suitable <b>measurements</b> on the <b>box</b> it is possible to "prepare" the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding <b>box</b> <b>measurements</b> be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a "fine structure" in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the <b>box</b> <b>measurement</b> is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{solar cells}} promise {{electricity}} generation {{at very low}} cost, and higher installation flexibility as compared to inorganic solar cells. The lower cost is achieved by cheaper semiconductors and easier manufacturing processes. The flexibility is naturally given by these ultra-thin, amorphous layers. Also the power conversion efficiency can be high enough for many applications. The organic molecules have to withstand the constant excitation by photons, transport of energy in form of excitons and charge. A small but significant amount of these photons has energy over the absorption gap, the excess of energy must be released without breaking the molecular bonds. In consequence, the solar cells can also heat up to temperatures at above 80 °C. The objective of this work is {{to answer the question}} if the small molecules organic solar cells can be stable enough to operate under a very long time. The stability of organic doped layers in an organic solar cell is also addressed. This work starts with a general introduction followed by the description of the experimental procedures. The aging experiments of the solar cell were done with a self developed equipment. The fabrication of this equipment (a set of <b>measurement</b> <b>boxes)</b> was necessary to maintain the conditions, under which a solar cell can be aged, as constant as possible. The <b>measurement</b> <b>boxes</b> were used to control the electrical load of the cell, its temperature, the illumination intensity, and its electric connection to the IxV measurement equipment. A software package was also developed to control the equipment and to facilitate the work and visualization of the high volume of collected data. The model solar cells chosen for the aging experiments were donor-acceptor heterojunctions devices formed with the well-known materials C 60 and ZnPc. Two basic different structures were analyzed, because they offered reasonable performance and potentially long lifetime: the flat heterojunction (FHJ) and the mixed heterojunction in a Metal-Insulator-p-Semiconductor (m-i-p) configuration. Variations of the FHJ and of the m-i-p structures are also used to verify the limits of the stability of electrically p- and n- doped organic semiconducting layers. The least stable solar cells are the FHJ devices. These devices show a fast initial decrease of all their characteristic conversion parameters but the Voc. After a few hundred hours, the saturation current (current under a reverse bias of 1 V) was almost stable. The saturation current is related to the number of absorbing centers, the decrease indicates that the degradation of the absorbing centers has stopped. With wavelength resolved external quantum efficiency measurements and chemical analysis, {{it was found that the}} degradation is related to the oxidation of C 60. It was also shown that the use of organic dopants do not significantly affect the lifetime. The results show that the m-i-p solar cells are more stable than the FHJ devices. They are also stable under high temperatures up to 105 °C. Outdoor testing also showed that the solar cells remained chemically, electrically and mechanically stable during a 900 h test...|$|R

On current IMB systems parallel current drivers work together to send a current that captures battery voltage response and processes that signal into impedance. While the data returned is good indication of the actual impedance measurements from the battery, the measurement quality can be improved by moving the ground of the current drivers from outside the box to in between the two current driver circuits (inside the box). This creates a floating ground (not connected to earth) and helps eliminate any noise that may accompany the current going into the battery when conducting test. This technique of moving the ground between the current drivers {{is referred to as}} Push Pull. The name comes from what is taking place for the two current drivers. One current driver will push the current, meanwhile, the second current driver will pull the current and in between these two drivers will be the floating ground. In order for this technique to work appropriately the current between the current drivers must match, otherwise mismatch will occur and results will suffer, achieving nothing but useless data. In order to get the currents to match, two control circuits are created: the bias current trim, and the gain trim. Bias trim will allow the use of trim pots to eliminate any bias current we do not want; meanwhile the gain trim will also use trim pots to make sure the two current driver gains are the same...|$|E

40|$|Stricter {{regulations}} concerning {{emissions from}} road traffic and increasing fuel prices has {{lead to an}} interest in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Today even manufacturers of heavy duty vehicles are introducing hybrid alternatives. Batteries are expensive and a complex part in HEVs, and ways of determining a battery’s capacity is a current research topic. When a battery is used it ages, i. e. the capacity decreases and the impedance rises. Since battery cost is high, {{it is important to}} be able to determine battery ageing properly. The focus of this master thesis has been on impedance measurement methods for Li-ion batteries. The work has been carried out in cooperation with Scania CV AB. When a battery is aged, the impedance increases. Monitoring ageing mechanisms could enable increased lifetime of the batteries through optimized usage in for example heavy duty hybrid vehicles. In this work, Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) has been compared with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). A major difference between these methods is that HPPC uses pulses of high direct current, whereas a small alternating current perturbation is used in EIS. EIS give information about different mechanisms influencing the battery impedance, e. g. internal resistance and charge transfer resistance, but requires expensive and complex laboratory equipment. HPPC gives less detailed information about the impedance, but is more similar to field applications for a vehicle. A literature survey showed that much research is conducted on in-situ impedance measurements of batteries. One example is the long-term demonstration of an Impedance <b>Measurement</b> <b>Box</b> (IMB), which is currently carried out at Idaho National Laboratory. The method uses a sum-of-sines signal consisting of octave harmonics for a fast impedance measurement with good precision. The results showed a good correlation with laboratory EIS measurements. The experimental part of this project suggest that a linear correlation  exists between the discharge resistance from HPPC measurements and the sum of internal resistance and charge transfer resistance from EIS measurements. The linear fitting did not have very good R-squared value but a residual analysis showed that the residuals were randomly scattered around zero, indicating that a linear fitting is suitable. However, the precision of the results is too poor for the correlation to be useful in a real HEV application. Additional work to improve the linear fitting is recommended. Furthermore, it was showed that AC-components have to be used as a measurement signal in order to measure the complex impedance of a battery. A paired t-test was conducted in order to study if noise could be used as that signal for a battery under load. The impedance at 100 Hz was calculated, which corresponds to the second harmonic of the power grid. The difference between this impedance and the impedance measured at 100 Hz with EIS was statistically tested. For shorter times pans (in this case 20 milliseconds) after applying the DC pulse, using noise cannot be ruled out for measuring a battery’s impedance under load. But for longer time spans after applying the DC pulse (in this case 1. 3 seconds), there was a significant difference between the two methods. Concentration gradients caused by mass transfer limitations could be causing this effect...|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Hawaii is {{the most}} {{petroleum}} dependent state in the nation. Despite having an abundance of natural resources, 94 percent of Hawaii's primary energy was derived from imported oil in 2010 [1]. "Residential consumers in Hawaii pay twice the national average for electricity and almost three {{times the national average}} (per BTU) for total energy consumed in homes" [2]. Decreasing Hawaii's dependency on imported fossil fuels will put the state on the path of increased independence from fluctuating oil prices and availability, as well as decreasing the pollution associated with the burning of oil. The burning of oil at power plants and the combustion of gasoline for transportation emits harmful pollutants into the atmosphere promoting global warming which is detrimental to the earth's atmosphere and have negative effects on human well-being. These negative impacts associated with Hawaii's fossil fuel dependence create the necessity for a change in Hawaii's primary energy source. Renewable energies are a potential solution to increase the state's energy security, which would increase economical stability. Renewable portfolio standards were established to provide states with a mechanism to increase renewable energy generation while using a costeffective, market-based approach that is administratively efficient [3]. The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (HCEI) established in 2008 promotes reduced energy consumption through building and household efficiency and increased deployment of renewable energy generation technologies. The goal of the initiative is to reduce fossil fuel use by 70 % clean energy by 2030 with 30 % from efficiency measures and 40 % coming from locally generated renewable sources [4]. In 2009, Hawaii consumed 269. 8 Trillion Btu, (249. 8 Trillion Btu from non-renewable energy and 20 Trillion Btu from renewable energies) [5]. The 20 Trillion Btu of renewable energies is further broken down into: 4. 4 % from biomass, 0. 4 % from hydropower, 1 % from wind, 0. 6 % from geothermal and 1 % from solar [5]. The grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system is one way of harnessing solar energy which is growing in popularity among residential applications. Grid-tied PV systems are a convenient renewable energy option available for residential applications in Hawaii for its scalability factor as well as the lack of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) that is required for larger renewable energies like wind, geothermal and hydroelectric powers. Residential grid-tied PV systems are composed of solar panels or PV modules that convert the solar energy to electricity which are connected to the grid via a conditioning system (inverters) as illustrated in Figure 1. Hawaii has recently seen a drastic increase in residential PV installations as a result of high electric rates and substantial tax credit incentives. Micro-inverter technology is the popular choice for the residential or small capacity systems (< 10 kW). This thesis presents the design, fabrication, testing and analysis from the data collected by the <b>measurement</b> <b>boxes</b> deployed at the PWW PV test-bed on the Big Island of Hawaii. Chapter 2 explains how the PV technology works and the characteristics associated with the module performance. The micro-inverter's functions and performance parameters are described in Chapter 3. The design, fabrication and calibration of the measurement devices at the PWW test-bed are specified in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 introduces the recorded data from the <b>measurement</b> <b>boxes</b> and evaluates the micro-inverter performance from the test-bed. Lastly, the observations and conclusions made from the inverter analysis are presented in Chapter 6, followed by the future work in Chapter 7...|$|R
40|$|A {{user-friendly}} {{version of}} the scientific environmental monitoring kit used in Australia during a large air quality (AQ) study was created to enable routine environmental assessment in commercial livestock buildings and thus improve building environments and reduce pollutant emissions. The objective {{of the study was}} to produce a reliable and cost-effective hardware and software system for measuring six key environmental variables. The main components of the 'BASE-Q' system are the two <b>measurement</b> <b>boxes</b> containing the sensors; the internet-based PC and pocket PC-based softwares; and the Users' Manual detailing recommended monitoring procedures. The first BASE-Q box contains sensors for measuring air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), the concentrations of ammonia (NH 3) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) up to 10 - 30 days depending on the logging interval. The second contains a vacuum pump and Venturi tubes and is used to measure concentrations of inhalable and respirable particles gravimetrically over an 8 - to 10 -h period. Engineering characteristics of the buildings are recorded on site and the collected data stored and processed by the internet or PC-based BASE-Q program. The program automatically calculates the concentrations and emission rates of the different airborne pollutants from individual buildings by using prediction models developed during related studies as a pre-screening exercise before actual measurements are undertaken. The size and weight of the monitoring hardware have been markedly reduced to improve ease of installation and transport. The monitoring equipment has been simplified and waterproofed to improve ease of deployment and disinfection. The special software has greatly simplified data management and reporting. These improvements have reduced the labor input required for operating the system and thus minimized the cost of AQ monitoring. This will enable producers and consultants to measure AQ routinely on farms, reducing worker OH&S risks, improving environmental outcomes, and potentially improving production efficiency...|$|R

The thermal field on window surface is defined by different parts such as transparent zone (glass) and frame (wood, aluminum or PVC) and their matching generates thermal bridges, downgrading the insulation properties of the entire window. The hot box test is a laboratory setup which allows the evaluation of the window thermal transmittance;the paper shows the comparison between the results obtained by hot <b>box</b> <b>measurements</b> and the thermal transmittance assessed by an original experimental methodology based on quantitative infrared thermography, conducted on a wooden window...|$|R
40|$|During the POLSTAR- 1 winter {{campaign}} conducted from Kiruna (Sweden) in 1998 (20 January - 6 February), {{measurements were}} made of gas-phase and total water vapour, gas-phase nitric acid, reactive nitrogen, trace gases like carbon monoxide and ozone, meteorological data and particles along a quasi-Lagrangian flight track in the tropopause region. In this paper we give criteria to investigate on the validity of comparisons between quasi-Lagrangian in situ <b>measurements</b> and <b>box</b> model calculations. These criteria are sued to evaluate the flight on 24 January. This flight was performed northwest of Kiruna across a cold trough of air with temperatures around 196 K cutting through the tropopause. These measurements show ice particle formation in the moist tropospheric region and suggest that ternary HNO 3 -H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O droplets or NAT (with currently no means for distinction) formed in the dry stratospheric air up and downstream of the ice cloud. Ice particles {{seem to be in}} thermodynamic equilibrium with water vapour. Uptake of HNO 3 into cirrus cloud particles seems to be consistent with the coexistence of HNO 3 -H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O liquid and ice in the same air mass...|$|R
40|$|The normal {{approach}} to assess signal quality parameters in a wireless network requires performing {{what is known}} as a drive test. A drive test consists on driving a vehicle equipped with a wireless <b>measurement</b> toll <b>box</b> around the area of interest, in order to take measures of several wireless signal parameters. Drive testing is a time consuming activity often affected by external factors such as vehicular traffic congestion and others. The slowness of the process makes this technique impractical when the goal is to measure the impact caused by minor changes on the network; when you need something like a trial-and-error approach; or if you are acting in a proactive way where trying to have an early alert on signal degradation before clients complains start. Having a system that provides instant quality of service data from any remote location should be a very useful tool for any mobile network operator. A sensor network approach can improve data acquisition response time, becoming a valuable help on network troubleshooting, maintenance, optimization, and quality of service assurance. In this sense, I propose to evaluate the benefits of using a sensor network {{approach to}} signal monitoring for telephone wireless network optimization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGravitational wave (GW) {{signals from}} {{coalescing}} massive black hole (MBH) binaries {{could be used}} as standard sirens to measure cosmological parameters. The future space-based GW observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to a hundred of those events, providing very accurate measurements of their luminosity distances. To constrain the cosmological parameters, we also need to measure the redshift of the galaxy (or cluster of galaxies) hosting the merger. This requires the identification of a distinctive electromagnetic event associated with the binary coalescence. However, putative electromagnetic signatures may be too weak to be observed. Instead, we study here the possibility of constraining the cosmological parameters by enforcing statistical consistency between all the possible hosts detected within the <b>measurement</b> error <b>box</b> of a few dozen of low-redshift (z < 3) events. We construct MBH populations using merger tree realizations of the dark matter hierarchy in a ΛCDM universe, and we use data from the Millennium simulation to model the galaxy distribution in the LISA error box. We show that, assuming that all the other cosmological parameters are known, the parameter w describing the dark energy equation of state can be constrained to a 4 %- 8 % level (2 σ error), competitive with current uncertainties obtained by type Ia supernovae measurements, providing an independent test of our cosmological model...|$|R
