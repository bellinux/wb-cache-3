5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat <b>meristem</b> changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical <b>meristem</b> {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates <b>meristem</b> growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming <b>meristem</b> tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E
50|$|Initially, a {{young plant}} will only produce phytomers at its apical <b>meristems</b> but later in development, {{secondary}} <b>meristems</b> {{will begin to}} form and phytomers will be formed on this lateral plant growth.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{secondary}} <b>meristems,</b> these are also called the lateral <b>meristems</b> because they surround the established stem of a plant and cause it to grow laterally (i.e., larger in diameter).|$|R
40|$|DSC {{analysis}} was performed at three points in the cryopreservation process on encapsulated-dehydrated <b>meristems</b> of Ribes ciliatum. <b>Meristems</b> were excised from shoots pre-treated with either sucrose or glucose, encapsulated in alginate beads, dehydrated in sucrose solutions, air dried, and plunged in liquid nitrogen. Thermal analysis revealed glass transitions during cooling of air-desiccated <b>meristems,</b> however, on rewarming a small endothermic event was detected suggesting glass destabilization can occur. Interestingly, this did not occur in alginate beads or <b>meristems</b> when these components were cooled and rewarmed separately. The possibility exists that thermal and moisture gradients may arise within the alginate bead/tissue complex and we propose that the heterogeneous composition of the <b>meristems</b> and the surrounding alginate may promote ice nucleation on rewarming. The significance of this regarding the stabilization of glasses formed in alginate beads and their encapsulated <b>meristems</b> is discussed. This study also reports an approach to Ribes cryopreservation in which the pregrowth of shoots in 0. 75 M sucrose for 1 week {{can be used as}} a substitute for cold acclimation. ...|$|R
5|$|The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis {{feeds on}} the {{underside}} of new leaves of F. rubiginosa, as well as F. obliqua and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming <b>meristem</b> tissue and a gall results, and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and live for around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night, wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. Psyllids have almost defoliated trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney in spring.|$|E
25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the apical <b>meristem</b> located near the tip of the root. The <b>meristem</b> cells more or less continuously divide, producing more <b>meristem,</b> root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the <b>meristem),</b> and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the <b>meristem</b> into a flower <b>meristem.</b> This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the <b>meristem,</b> particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the <b>meristem</b> to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of <b>meristem,</b> apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral <b>meristem</b> is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E
50|$|In many {{vascular}} plants, {{secondary growth}} {{is the result}} of the activity of the two lateral <b>meristems,</b> the cork cambium and vascular cambium. Arising from lateral <b>meristems,</b> secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length. As long as the lateral <b>meristems</b> continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter. In woody plants, this process produces wood, and shapes the plant into a tree with a thickened trunk.|$|R
40|$|Shoot <b>meristems</b> are {{maintained}} by {{pluripotent stem cells}} that are controlled by CLAVATA-WUSCHEL feedback signaling. This pathway, which coordinates stem cell proliferation with differentiation, was first identified in Arabidopsis, but appears to be conserved in diverse higher plant species. In this Review, we highlight the commonalities and differences between CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathways in different species, {{with an emphasis on}} Arabidopsis, maize, rice and tomato. We focus on stem cell control in shoot <b>meristems,</b> but also briefly discuss the role of these signaling components in root <b>meristems...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{growth and}} {{form of a}} forest tree {{are the result of}} {{activity}} in the primary and secondary <b>meristems,</b> influenced by the distribution of photosynthate from its needles and the hormonal gradients controlled by the apical <b>meristems</b> (Fraser et al. 1964). External factors also influence growth and form.|$|R
25|$|The <b>meristem</b> {{architectures}} differ between angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes. The gymnosperm vegetative <b>meristem</b> lacks organization into distinct tunica and corpus layers. They possess large cells called central mother cells. In angiosperms, {{the outermost}} layer of cells divides anticlinally {{to generate the}} new cells, while in gymnosperms, the plane of division in the <b>meristem</b> differs for different cells. However, the apical cells do contain organelles like large vacuoles and starch grains, like the angiosperm meristematic cells.|$|E
25|$|Cytokinins – Cytokinins {{regulate}} root apical <b>meristem</b> {{size and}} promote lateral root elongation.|$|E
25|$|Grasses are {{unusual in}} that the <b>meristem</b> is located {{near the bottom of}} the plant; hence, they can quickly recover from {{cropping}} at the top.|$|E
40|$|Live imaging of {{above ground}} <b>meristems</b> {{can lead to}} new {{insights}} in plant development not possible from static imaging of fixed tissue. The use of an upright confocal microscope offers several technical and biological advantages for live imaging floral or shoot <b>meristems.</b> However, many departments and core facilities possess only inverted confocal microscopes and lack the funding for an additional upright confocal microscope. Here we show that imaging of living apical <b>meristems</b> can be performed on existing inverted confocal microscopes {{with the use of}} an affordable and detachable InverterScope accessory...|$|R
50|$|In angiosperms, {{intercalary}} <b>meristems</b> {{occur only}} in monocot (in particular, grass) stems {{at the base}} of nodes and leaf blades. Horsetails also exhibit intercalary growth. Intercalary <b>meristems</b> are capable of cell division, and they allow for rapid growth and regrowth of many monocots. Intercalary <b>meristems</b> at the nodes of bamboo allow for rapid stem elongation, while those {{at the base of}} most grass leaf blades allow damaged leaves to rapidly regrow. This leaf regrowth in grasses evolved in response to damage by grazing herbivores, but is more familiar to us in response to lawnmowers.|$|R

25|$|<b>Meristem</b> {{identity}} genes. Code for {{the transcription}} factors required {{to initiate the}} induction of the identity genes. They are positive regulators of organ identity during floral development.|$|E
25|$|The <b>meristem</b> can {{be defined}} as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain {{undifferentiated}} stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. Their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative <b>meristem</b> or the <b>meristem</b> of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic cell fate determination mechanisms. This means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell’s characteristics (gene WUSCHEL or WUS), and others will act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene CLAVATA or CLV). In this way both mechanisms give rise to a feedback loop, which along with other elements lend a great deal of robustness to the system. Along with the WUS gene the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) gene also represses the differentiation of the meristematic dome. This gene acts by inhibiting the possible differentiation of the stem cells but still allows cell division in the daughter cells, which, had they been allowed to differentiate, would have given rise to distinct organs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} major {{epidermal}} cell types which all ultimately {{derive from the}} outermost (L1) tissue layer of the shoot apical <b>meristem,</b> called protodermal cells: trichomes, pavement cells and guard cells, {{all of which are}} arranged in a non-random fashion.|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation via droplet {{vitrification}} showed {{high efficiency}} for cassava <b>meristems</b> (79 % average recovery) when these were excised from in vitro seedlings. The {{efficiency of the}} process dropped considerably (to > 23 %) when <b>meristems</b> were excised from field-grown plants, thus precluding {{the use of such}} explants for routine cryobanking. In yam, large disparities were observed in the ability of <b>meristems</b> to produce a shoot after cryopreservation ranging from 0 to 60 %, depending on the accession. Overall, better recovery was observed for Dioscorea rotundata than for D. alata, the two main species tested. Using a probabilistic decision support tool and taking into consideration our cryoprocessing capacity, we conclude that processing 100 <b>meristems</b> per accession and retrieving 30 to estimate the recovery rate of the batch are a good compromise for the cryobanking routine.

40|$|Cold {{acclimation}} of Lolium L. and Zoysia Willd. grass cultivars {{significantly increased}} regrowth of cryopreserved <b>meristems.</b> One wk of cold acclimation improved recovery (ollowing cryopreservation but extended cold acclimation (4 - 8 wk) {{resulted in the}} best regrowth. Cold acclimation also significantly increased the dehydration tolerance of both Zoysia and Lolium <b>meristems.</b> Lolium apices cold acclimated for 4 wk produced 60 - 100 % regrowth following cryopreservation by slow freezing or encapsulation-dehydration. Cold-acclimated Zoysia had greater than 60 % regrowth following encapsulation-dehydration when beads were dehydrated to less than 22 % water content. Non-acclimated <b>meristems</b> of both genera {{had little or no}} regrowth.

25|$|ABC {{model of}} flower {{development}} is a scientific model of {{the process by which}} flowering plants produce a pattern of gene expression in meristems that leads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards sexual reproduction, a flower. There are three physiological developments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the apical meristem’s function from a vegetative <b>meristem</b> into a floral <b>meristem</b> or inflorescence; and finally the growth of the flower’s individual organs. The latter phase has been modelled using the ABC model, which aims to describe the biological basis of the process from the perspective of molecular and developmental genetics.|$|E
25|$|In Antirrhinum, the {{orthologous}} gene to AP1 is SQUAMOSA (SQUA), {{which also}} has a particular impact on the floral <b>meristem.</b> The homologs for AP2 are LIPLESS1 (LIP1) and LIPLESS2 (LIP2), which have a redundant function and are of special interest {{in the development of}} sepals, petals and ovules.|$|E
25|$|In an adult, the phloem originates, {{and grows}} {{outwards}} from, meristematic {{cells in the}} vascular cambium. Phloem is produced in phases. Primary phloem is laid down by the apical <b>meristem</b> and develops from the procambium. Secondary phloem is laid down by the vascular cambium {{to the inside of}} the established layer(s) of phloem.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{growth and}} {{development}} in plants are accomplished by <b>meristems,</b> groups of undifferentiated cells that persist as stem cells and initiate organs. While the structures of the apical and floral <b>meristems</b> in dicotyledonous plants have been well described, {{little is known about}} the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling cell proliferation and differentiation in these structures. We have shown previously that the CLAVATA 1 (CLV 1) gene in Arabidopsis encodes a receptor kinase-like protein that controls the size of the apical and floral <b>meristems.</b> Here, we show that KAPP, a gene encoding a kinase-associated protein phosphatase, is expressed in apical and young floral <b>meristems,</b> along with CLV 1. Overexpression of KAPP mimics the clv 1 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, CLV 1 has kinase activity: it phosphorylates both itself and KAPP. Finally, KAPP binds and dephosphorylates CLV 1. We present a model where KAPP functions as a negative regulator of the CLAVATA 1 signal transduction pathway...|$|R
25|$|In epigeal {{germination}} (or epigeous germination), the hypocotyl elongates {{and forms}} a hook, pulling rather than pushing the cotyledons and apical <b>meristem</b> through the soil. Once {{it reaches the}} surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.|$|E
25|$|A flower's anatomy, {{as defined}} by the {{presence}} of a series of organs (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) positioned according to a given pattern, facilitate sexual reproduction in flowering plants. The flower arises from the activity of three classes of genes, which regulate floral development: genes which regulate the identity of the <b>meristem,</b> the identity of the flower organ and finally cadastral genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{methodology}} for studying flower development involves two steps. Firstly, {{the identification of}} the exact genes required for determining the identity of the floral <b>meristem.</b> In A. thaliana these include APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY). Secondly, genetic analysis is carried out on the aberrant phenotypes for the relative characteristics of the flowers, which allows the characterization of the homeotic genes implicated in the process.|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the gene flowering promoting factor 1 (FPF 1), which {{is expressed in}} apical <b>meristems</b> immediately after the photoperiodic induction of flowering in the long-day plants mustard and Arabidopsis. In early transition stages, expression is only detectable in the peripheral zone of apical meristems; however, later on, {{it can also be}} found in floral <b>meristems</b> and in axillary <b>meristems</b> that form secondary inflorescences. The FPF 1 gene encodes a 12. 6 -kD protein that has no homology to any previously identified protein of known function. Constitutive expression of the gene in Arabidopsis under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter resulted in a dominant heritable trait of early flowering under both short- and long-day conditions. Treatments with gibberellin (GA) and paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, as well as crosses with GA-deficient mutants indicate that FPF 1 is involved in a GA-dependent signaling pathway and modulates a GA response in apical <b>meristems</b> during the transition to flowering...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolD oncogene induces precocious floral transition and strong flowering potential in tobacco and tomato. Here, we describe specific developmental effects induced by {{expression of}} rolD in Arabidopsis. We show that floral transition, as histologically monitored, occurred in rolD- plants earlier than in wild type, and this was coupled with a premature and enhanced formation of vegetative and reproductive axillary bud <b>meristems.</b> Furthermore, CYP 79 F 1 /SUPERSHOOT/ BUSHY (SPS), a gene that negatively controls shoot branching in Arabidopsis and involved in glucosinolate metabolism and in cytokinin and auxin homeostasis, was down-regulated in rolD plants. The multiplication of post-embryonic <b>meristems</b> was also observed in the root system, with enhanced adventitious root formation. This result was confirmed by thin cell layer response in vitro, both under hormone-free and standard rooting conditions. However, the formation of lateral root <b>meristems</b> was not affected by rolD expression. Our results show that rolD accelerates and enhances specific post-embryonic <b>meristems</b> in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|The maize (Zea mays L.) {{mutation}} Tassel seed 6 (Ts 6) disrupts both {{sex determination}} in the tassel and {{the pattern of}} branching in inflorescences. This results {{in the formation of}} supernumerary florets in tassels and ears and in the development of pistils in tassel florets where they are normally aborted. A developmental analysis indicated that extra florets in Ts 6 inflorescences are most likely the result of delayed determinacy in spikelet <b>meristems,</b> which then initiate additional floret <b>meristems</b> rather than initiating floral organs as in wild type. I have used culturing experiments to assay whether delayed determinacy of Ts 6 mutant tassels is reflected in an altered timing of specific determination events. Length of the tassel was used as a developmental marker. These experiments showed that although Ts 6 tassels elongate much more slowly than wild type, both mutant and wild-type tassels gained the ability to form flowers with organs of normal morphology in culture at the same time. In situ hybridization patterns of expression of the maize gene Kn, which is normally expressed in shoot <b>meristems</b> and not in determinate lateral organs, confirmed that additional <b>meristems,</b> rather than lateral organs, are initiated by spikelet <b>meristems</b> in Ts 6 tassels...|$|R
