5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} inactive basin, extremely high population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|The draft SI {{brochure}} {{assumes the}} first will remain true, which would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second {{will no longer}} be true. The molar mass constant, while still with great accuracy remaining equal to 1 g/mol, {{will no longer be}} exactly equal to that.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
50|$|Squamates are {{represented}} by viviparous, ovoviviparous, and oviparous species. Viviparous <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female gives birth to live young, Ovoviviparous <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> egg will develop inside the female’s body and Oviparous <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female lays eggs. A few species within Squamata {{have the ability to}} reproduce asexually. The tuatara lays eggs that are usually about one inch in length and which take about 14 months to incubate.|$|R
50|$|Driving range parity <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{electric}} vehicle {{has the same}} range than an average all-combustion vehicle (500 km), with 1+ kWh/kg batteries. Higher range <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{electric vehicle}}s would run more kilometers without recharge.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is real according to Tulsidas, {{in keeping with the}} Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E
5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While {{it is often difficult}} to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{team from}} Calvin College {{examined}} the light curves of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, and found a median spin period of 18.9 hours. This value {{was significantly higher than}} that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the Kuiper belt (see below).|$|E
5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other {{would be able to}} consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional date of Edwin's death may need to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may also <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E
