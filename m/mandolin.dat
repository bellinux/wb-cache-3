The <b>mandolins</b> they made changed over generations, from mandolinos with flat soundboards and gut-strings, through <b>mandolins</b> with a bent soundboard and bronze or bronze-and-gut strings, into <b>mandolins</b> with bent soundboards that used steel or steel-and-bronze strings.|$|R

5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the <b>mandolin,</b> and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E

Numbers 7 and 8 were elite instruments, more decorated than the other models.|$|R
5|$|After touring Europe {{opening for}} Sugar, the band {{replaced}} Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: John Stirratt replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while Max Johnston, {{the brother of}} Michelle Shocked, joined as a live <b>mandolin</b> and violin performer. Stirratt became a full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and <b>mandolin,</b> unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and <b>mandolin,</b> {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E

Their <b>mandolins</b> are highly regarded, they [...] "more or less rule in the bluegrass market" [...] in the United States.

5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica and <b>mandolin.</b> The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E

5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a <b>mandolin</b> was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the club stem {{from a variety of}} groups that came {{together}} in 1876. After a number of years including banjo and <b>mandolin</b> players in the club, it reverted to simply a vocal group by the mid-1920s. It received a substantial rise in profile under the directory of Philip Duey in the 1950s, who organised national, then international tours, and numerous television appearances. Since then, the club has continued to tour internationally at high-profile venues.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas are}} {{reflected}} in the arrangement and composition of the album, which lead to a sound of dread and dissonance. The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound; in addition to the orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a hurdy-gurdy, <b>mandolin,</b> accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|Electric <b>mandolins</b> {{were built}} in the United States as early as the late 1920s. Among the first {{companies}} to produce them were Stromberg-Voisinet, Electro (which later became Rickenbacker), Vivi-Tone, and National Reso-Phonic. Gibson and Vega introduced their electric <b>mandolins</b> in 1936.|$|R

5000|$|More importantly, Spinelli {{composed}} an Intermezzo for <b>mandolins</b> and orchestra, as {{a prelude}} to the third and last act, a departure from the customary instrumentation. Philip J. Bone said said that the audience reaction to the Intermezzo [...] "was extraordinary." [...] Bone, a music historian, added more detail about the use of <b>mandolins</b> by Spinelli, saying, [...] "Spinelli makes good use of the <b>mandolins,</b> writing an elaborate cadenza in double stopping and rapid chromatic passages, which evidences a practical acquaintance with the instrument." [...] He also said that the parts of the Intermezzo that were written for <b>mandolins</b> were the sections most striking feature of the Intermezzo, along with the melody written for cello.|$|R
5|$|Written for piano, guitar, and <b>mandolin,</b> {{the music}} {{begins in the}} key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord {{progression}} of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and <b>mandolin</b> cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a <b>mandolin</b> or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5000|$|A basso porto {{was first}} {{performed}} in Engl{{and by the}} Carl Rosa Co., in March, 1899, at Brighton, and by the Queen's Hall Orchestra on October 11, 1900, under Mr. H. Wood. [...] The opera focuses on the slums of Naples, where Spinelli used <b>mandolins</b> and guitars in several places in his orchestral score. The mandolinists were Florimond and Cesare Costers. [...] The <b>mandolins</b> were {{an important part of}} the opera, accompanying the tenor song of the second act, and the finale of the third act. Spinelli composed an Intermezzo for <b>mandolins</b> and orchestra, as a prelude to the third and last act, a departure from the customary instrumentation. Philip J.
