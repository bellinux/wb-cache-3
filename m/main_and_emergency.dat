She sailed unescorted, and early on the morning of 2 July she was about 75 miles west of Bloody Foreland when , commanded by U-Boat ace Günther Prien, struck her with a single torpedo. Prien believed the torpedo to be faulty, but it detonated against Arandora Stars starboard side, flooding her after engine room.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the interface between elderly care <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness from the elderly care staff's perspective. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to elderly care staff in 4 Swedish municipalities. The questions involved experiences of extraordinary events, education and exercises, and risk and vulnerability analyses, evaluations of <b>main</b> risks <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness, <b>and</b> familiarity with preparedness plans. In total, 568 elderly care staff responded. RESULTS: Between 15 % and 25 % of the respondents claimed experiences of extraordinary events, exercises and education, and risk and vulnerability analyses. The same number claimed familiarity with the organization's preparedness plan, whereas ~ 85 % answered that they need more education <b>and</b> exercises. <b>Emergency</b> preparedness was evaluated as important. The experiences and risks referred to pertained to both official categories used within <b>emergency</b> preparedness <b>and</b> issues such as work conditions, seniors' fall accidents. CONCLUSION: Elderly care staff, though highly motivated, {{do not seem to be}} involved in <b>emergency</b> preparedness <b>and</b> are not targeted to a large extent when education and training are organized. A development of the interface between <b>emergency</b> preparedness <b>and</b> elderly care could require a clarification of the scope <b>and</b> context of <b>emergency</b> preparedness <b>and</b> of differing understandings of central concepts.

50|$|Halon 1301 was {{developed}} in {{a joint venture between}} the U.S. Army and DuPont in 1954, and introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression fixed systems agent in the 1960s, and was used around valuable materials, such as aircraft, mainframe computers, and telecommunication switching centers, usually in total flooding systems. It was also widely used in the maritime industry to add a third level of protection should the <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> fire pumps become inoperable or ineffective. Halon 1301 was never widely used in portables outside military and spacecraft applications, due to its limited range, and invisible discharge. It does not produce the characteristic white cloud like CO2 and is difficult to direct when fighting large fires. Halon 1301 is ideal for armored vehicles and spacecraft, however, because it produces less toxic by-products than does Halon 1211, which is critical for combat or space conditions where a compartment {{may not be able to}} be ventilated immediately. Halon 1301 is widely used by the U.S. Military and NASA in a 2-3/4 lb portable extinguisher with a sealed, disposable cylinder for quick recharging. Other agents such as CO2 and E-36 Cryotech wet chemical are largely replacing halon 1301, however, due to environmental concerns. Civilian models in 2-3/4, 3, and 4 lb sizes were also made.|$|E
40|$|Failures of barrages or {{regulators}} {{or parts}} of them may be expected when excessive scour patterns are observed downstream of such structures. Severe and excessive scour may be largely due to unsymmetric operation of gates especially when a multi-vents barrages or regulator is being considered. Previous investigations proved that the scour patterns downstream hydraulic structures are functions of the bottom velocities among other relevant factors such as Froude number, operation of gates, …. etc. In this paper, {{the results of an}} experimental investigation on the effect of operations of gates of mutli-vents regulator on the pattern of bottom velocity (velocity near bed) are presented. The experimental program was carried under submeregd flow conditions. Symmetric and asymmetric operation of main gates, emergency gates and mixed operation of <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> gates are considered. An electromagetic flow meter is used to measure the velocity components (in x and y directions) near bed at a predefined mesh over both rigid and movable beds. The pattern of the velocity vectors for each run is plotted to indicate the relative magintude and direction of the bottom velocity, which in turn, could be used to predict the pattern of scour downstream of rigid bed of the multi-vents regulator. It is observed that the velocity pattern {{is a function of the}} operation of gates, type of gates (main or emergency), Froude number at the vena contracta, and submergence ratio. The qualitative and quantitative effects of all these parameters on the bottom velocity are presented in the present research paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the 2017 Oroville Dam {{spillway}} incident. This event is {{yet another example of}} the severe problems the United States has with maintaining its large infrastructure. However, in order to better understand how events unfolded, it is first necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of Oroville Dam and the basic elements of its location, the Feather River Basin. An assessment of the hydroclimatic characteristics of the area reveals it to have a Mediterranean climate, indicated by heavy precipitation during the winter months, producing floods during the spring, followed by almost completely dry summers. From a geological standpoint, the area near Oroville Dam contains metavolcanic rock, which is of adequate hardness, but it is also significantly weathered, especially near the ground surface. This thesis also contains a summary of various Oroville Dam design elements, as well as a full history of its construction. This analysis reveals hidden clues that help identify the causes of the 2017 incident. Most significantly, design criteria for the <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> spillways appear much more relaxed than those of the main structure. Next, a study of the previous significant floods that occurred at Oroville Dam is conducted. This reveals that reservoir levels were much higher during the 2017 incident compared to other events, which indicates a need to lower the minimum flood control elevation. Futhermore, this thesis includes an extensive timeline of the 2017 incident events, including the damages to Oroville Dam’s main spillway chute and area downstream of the emergency spillway. After further research, initial cause of the main spillway failure is defined as concrete chute floor slab uplift, caused due to faults in the drain system below it. In addition, perusal of previous official inspection reports reveals that under current practice standards, if a comparable incident occurs again, its indications are unlikely to be detected in time. Finally, recommendations are made in order to avoid similar events from happening in the future. For Oroville Dam, this means lowering the minimum flood control elevation level and creating a fully armored concrete emergency spillway. In the short term, informal inspections by the authorities that operate large structures in the United States can discover faults before they turn into accidents. However, a more long-term plan to effectively repair and maintain the country’s existing infrastructure needs to be put into action immediately...|$|E

40|$|We {{summarize}} the inspections of radiocesium concentration levels in rice produced in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, for 3 {{years from the}} nuclear accident in 2011. In 2011, three types of verifications, preliminary survey, <b>main</b> inspection, <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> survey, revealed that rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 500  Bq/kg (the provisional regulation level until March 2012 in Japan) was identified in the areas north and west of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The internal exposure of an average adult eating rice grown in the area north of the nuclear plant was estimated as 0. 05  mSv/year. In 2012, Fukushima Prefecture authorities decided to investigate the radiocesium concentration levels in all rice using custom-made belt conveyor testers. Notably, rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 100  Bq/kg (the new standard since April 2012 in Japan) were detected in only 71 and 28 bags out of the total 10, 338, 000 in 2012 and 11, 001, 000 in 2013, respectively.
