5000|$|A <b>Monolithic</b> <b>Microwave</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit,</b> or MMIC (sometimes {{pronounced}} [...] "mimic"), {{is a type}} {{of integrated}} circuit (IC) device that operates at microwave frequencies (300 MHz to 300 GHz). These devices typically perform functions such as microwave mixing, power amplification, low-noise amplification, and high-frequency switching.
