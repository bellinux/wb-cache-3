5|$|Neddermeyer {{contributed to}} the {{research}} {{which led to the}} 1932 discovery of the positron, for which Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. That year, Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon, using cloud chamber measurements of cosmic rays. Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as <b>mediating</b> the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in <b>mediating</b> the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Background: Drug {{hypersensitivity}} is classically {{divided into}} IgE <b>mediated</b> and non-IgE <b>mediated</b> disease. We report a rare case of consequent IgE <b>mediated</b> and non-IgE <b>mediated</b> reactions within the beta lactam class of antibiotics. Case Summary: An 84 -year-old man developed {{toxic epidermal necrolysis}} (TEN) due to ceftriaxone, a third generation cephalosporin, involving 72 % of the body surface area. The patient recovered but within weeks subsequently developed an acute IgE <b>mediated</b> allergic reaction to piperacillin/tazobactam, an extended spectrum penicillin. Further IgE RAST revealed positive results to penicillin major determinant. Discussion: This case demonstrates the complexity of drug hypersensitivity reactions. While it is accepted that IgE <b>mediated</b> penicillin allergy is a predisposition to cephalosporin allergy, this case displays an unusual correlation between drug hypersensitivity and drug class. There have been few studies that evaluate the cross reactivity with penicillin or other beta-lactams in subjects with primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins. This clinical scenario emphasizes the need of more studies on cephalosporin allergy in particular as shown by this case of sequential non-IgE <b>mediated</b> cephalosporin induced TEN reaction pursuant by an IgE <b>mediated</b> penicillin allergy...|$|R
5|$|The Republic of Texas {{declared}} {{independence from}} the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. At the time {{the vast majority of}} the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, opposed the introduction of Texas, a vast slave-holding region, into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with Great Britain <b>mediating.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, <b>mediating</b> in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Presidency is {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term.

In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term.

Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly <b>mediating</b> between the two factions.|$|E

5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and <b>mediating</b> some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E

5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, <b>mediating</b> between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 1653, the <b>mediating</b> Catholic central Swiss cantons {{proposed}} in Lucerne {{a resolution that}} fulfilled most of the peasants' demands, especially the fiscal ones. In Bern, a similar compromise was proposed by a Protestant delegation from Zürich {{under the direction of}} the mayor of Zürich, Johann Heinrich Waser, on April 4, 1653. The Bernese Emmental and most of the districts of the canton of Lucerne accepted these resolutions and their representatives swore new oaths of fealty. But the people in the Entlebuch valley did not accept the authorities' terms, as these—besides offering some tax reliefs—criminalized the insurrection and called for the punishment of the leaders. At a meeting at Signau on April 10, 1653, the delegates from the Entlebuch convinced their neighbours in the Emmental: the assembly decided not to honor the new oaths its representatives had sworn in Bern.|$|E

Nicolae Bălcescu emerged from his refuge in the Principality of Serbia, and, together with Alexandru G. Golescu and Ion Ionescu de la Brad, began talks with Iancu in Zlatna. The Wallachians presented Kossuth's proposal that Iancu's fighters should leave their base in the Apuseni and help rekindle revolution in Wallachia, leaving room for Hungary to resist Russian invention, but the offer was dismissed on the spot. In parallel, Magheru reached out to Hungarian authorities, asking them to consider confederating Hungary proper and Transylvania; this plan was also rejected.|$|E
