50|$|A {{torque wrench}} is used where the {{tightness}} of screws and bolts is crucial. It allows the operator {{to measure the}} torque applied to the fastener {{so it can be}} matched to the specifications for a particular application. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts. A torque wrench measures torque as a proxy for bolt tension. The technique suffers from inaccuracy due to inconsistent or uncalibrated friction between the fastener and its <b>mating</b> <b>hole.</b> Measuring bolt tension (indirectly via bolt stretch) is actually what is desired, but often torque is the only practical measurement which can be made.|$|E
40|$|Hot {{structures}} fabricated from orthotropic {{materials are}} an attractive design option for future high speed vehicles. Joining subassemblies {{of these materials}} with standard cylindrical fasteners can lead to loose joints or highly stressed joints due to thermal stress. A method has been developed to eliminate thermal stress and maintain a tight joint by shaping the fastener and <b>mating</b> <b>hole.</b> This method allows both materials (fastener and structure), with different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE's) {{in each of the}} three principal material directions, to expand freely with temperature yet remain in contact. For the assumptions made in the analysis, the joint will remain snug, yet free of thermal stress at any temperature. Finite element analysis was used to verify several thermal-stress-free fasteners and to show that conical fasteners, which are thermal-stress-free for isotropic materials, can reduce thermal stresses for transversely isotropic materials compared to a cylindrical fastener. Equations for thermal-stress-free shapes are presented and typical fastener shapes are shown...|$|E

50|$|The {{jig grinder}} {{is very similar}} to a jig borer, in that the table {{positioning}} and spindles are very accurate (far more so than a manual milling machine or lathe). It is almost exclusively used by tool and die makers in the creation of jigs or <b>mating</b> <b>holes</b> and pegs on dies. There are usually many peripheral elements to a large jig grinder, including separate hydraulic motors, air compressors, and various cooling systems for both the hydraulic circuit and supplying coolant to the work and machine itself.|$|R

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the <b>mating</b> <b>holes</b> to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} use a {{knowledge}} based approach to assist in mechanical design focusing on dimensional tolerancing. To illustrate our approach, we capture the knowledge which human designers utilize in order to specify dimensional tolerances on shafts and <b>mating</b> <b>holes</b> {{in order to meet}} desired classes of fit as set by relevant engineering standards.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} Finite Element {{model is}} used to investigate the loosening behavior of countersunk threaded fasteners subjected to cyclic shear loading applied through prescribed transverse excitation to the fastener head. Fasteners with conical head profile require precision machining of both the fastener head and the <b>mating</b> joint <b>hole.</b> Any mismatch between the head and the joint conical angles affects the torque tension relationship {{as well as the}} loosening performance. Investigation focuses on the loosening behavior in its early stages. Factors investigated include the effect of the bolt head/joint hole contact location, joint elastic modulus, and tapped hole clearance for different combinations of thread fit, on the loosening performance of preloaded countersunk-head bolts. The FEA model prediction of the self-loosening behavior is experimentally validated...|$|R
25|$|H. pomatia eggs measure about 3mm in {{diameter}} and have a calcareous shell and a high yolk content. H. pomatia lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after <b>mating,</b> in <b>holes</b> dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only {{the top of the}} shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is glycoprotein similar to eggwhite.|$|R

It can be made from a low melting point metal, such as a tin-bismuth alloy, or a polymer, such as a soluble acrylate.

40|$|Traditionally, {{precision}} assemblies in {{high volume}} manufacturing have used pin-hole joints; however {{the evolution of}} more stringent design requirements has pushed the performance of this method to its practical performance limit of approximately five microns repeatability. Next generation designs (i. e. automotive engines and pump assemblies) require low-cost couplings which permit sealing between interfaces and deliver better than five micron repeatability. This presentation will introduce a fundamentally new type of kinematic coupling, the quasi-kinematic coupling, which costs less than most precision pinned joints, delivers sub-micron repeatability, and allows contact/sealing between mated components. GEOMETRY In general, Quasi-Kinematic Couplings (QKCs) are well-suited for high volume precision assembly, particularly where integral locating features and/or sealing contact are required. Quasi-kinematic couplings are similar to traditional Kinematic Couplings as they consist of three convex protrusions which mate with three corresponding grooves. However, QKC grooves and convex surfaces are formed as surfaces of revolutions (i. e. for instance a conical <b>hole).</b> <b>Mating</b> the kinematic elements results in six arced lines of contact (two at each groove-protrusion joint) not six points as in a kinemati...|$|R
