5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt <b>medical</b> <b>personnel</b> from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other <b>medical</b> <b>personnel</b> attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} various {{rules for}} scheduling appointments for medical clinic outpatients and investigates {{their ability to}} minimize a weighted sum of <b>medical</b> <b>personnel's</b> and patients' idle-time costs. It is shown that the idle times incurred by any given rule {{are affected by the}} following three "environmental factors" (in decreasing order of importance) : the probability of no-show, the coefficient of variation of service times, and the number of patients per clinical session. Theoretically, an appropriate scheduling rule can be identified only if one knows the values of these parameters and the ratio between the <b>medical</b> <b>personnel's</b> and patients' idle-time costs. Under environments characterized by 27 different combinations of the three environmental factors, the performance of nine scheduling rules are evaluated using simulation. Some of the rules evaluated are original to this study. The results are presented in the form of "efficient frontiers," together with a simple procedure for identifying the best scheduling rule for given environmental-parameter values. This rule-identification procedure is shown to be easily adaptable for circumstances with limited knowledge about the environmental factors; it also reveals that the simple Bailey-Welch individual-appointment rules are surprisingly robust. scheduling, health care, simulation...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. <b>Medical</b> <b>personnel</b> who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
