Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records.

I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nationally {{known and}} local writers have {{frequently}} remarked on the solitude and visual appeal of Church in the Wood.
