40|$|We {{compared}} {{the acceptance of}} 4 -day old virgin queens introduced into mating nucleus hives using natural and artificial queen cells versus a wooden 3 -hole <b>mailing</b> <b>cage,</b> a standard introduction method. The queen cell methods gave high acceptance (95 % and 93 % for natural and artificial, respectively) even though the queen {{was released from the}} queen cell approximately 10 minutes after being introduced into the mating hive. By contrast, success using mailing cages was significantly lower (47 % and 73 %) when the queen was released from her cage after I hour or 48 hours, respectively. The equal success rates of the reused and artificial queen cells suggests that high success is not due to chemicals present in natural queen cells transferring to the queens. To further investigate why queen cells give higher introduction success than cages, we introduced virgin queens into queenless observation hives. Workers attacked only I of 12 queens leaving a queen cell whereas 5 out of 6 queens leaving a cage were attacked...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{introducing}} virgin queens into mating hives {{were compared with}} the standard method of using a "ripe" queen cell. Virgins were introduced into queenless mating nucleus hives (5 -frame medium Langstroth) using a wooden <b>mailing</b> <b>cage</b> with candy and attendant bees and were released three days later. When the caged virgins were 0 - 1 days old when introduced, the proportion giving rise to an egg-laying queen (65 %) was almost as high as with cells (70 %) (P = 0. 63, test). Success dropped to 55 % (P = 0. 04) for 3 - 4 day old virgins. If the virgin was introduced into a queenright mating hive for three additional days before the colony queen was removed the success rate was only 29 % (P = 0. 001). Across all methods, most queen loss occurred in the introduction/emergence period, with only one third in the mating period. The time taken to start egg laying, which averaged 12. 9 days from emergence, did not vary significantly among methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} in a honeybee breeding apiary at Teodorów in 2004. Honeybee queens were caged in queenless colonies or in an incubator. Temperature was compared in spaces between frames of colonies where either non-inseminated queens were kept in Zander cages without attendant bees or instrumentally inseminated queens in “Folchron ” <b>mailing</b> <b>cages</b> were attended by bees. Temperature was also measured in cages with queens that were placed in beehives or in incubators. Temperature records were also taken outside the beehives and in the incubators. During the final investigations {{the manner in which}} the queens were kept before and after insemination was compared for its impact on the filling of queen spermathecae and on the evacuation of sperm from the oviduct. The temperature in the frame spaces of honeybee nests in which the cages with instrumentally inseminated bees together with attendant bees were placed was found to average 34. 5 °C and to be significantly higher than that measured in the frame spaces containing cages with non-inseminated queens and without attendant bees. In each of the nurse colonies with inseminated queens different thermal conditions prevailed, with ambient temperature having a significant impact...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, 8886 slowed {{down to a}} crawl as it turned down Niels Hemmingsens Gade. An early plan was to use a fake bicycle {{accident}} to attack 8886 here, but this was abandoned as being too risky. At 05:07, 8886 drove into the yard behind the old post office, the gatekeeper closed the gate, and JF reported safe arrival to the radio dispatcher. At estimated 05:07, FA got out of 8886 and rang the bell for the postal workers {{to pick up the}} cargo. At estimated 05:10, FA and two postal workers unloaded the <b>mail</b> to a <b>cage</b> on wheels on the loading ramp.|$|R
