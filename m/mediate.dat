50|$|<b>Mediated</b> {{communication}} or <b>mediated</b> interaction (less often, <b>mediated</b> discourse) {{refers to}} communication {{carried out by}} the use of information communication technology, and can be contrasted to face-to-face communication.

40|$|The chemoreceptors {{responsible}} for the repellent response of Escherichia coli to phenol were investigated. In the absence of all four known methyl-accepting chemoreceptors (Tar, Tsr, Trg, and Tap), cells showed no response to phenol. However, when Trg, which <b>mediates</b> the attractant response to ribose and galactose, was introduced via a plasmid, the cells acquired a repellent response to phenol. About 1 mM phenol induced a clear repellent response; this response was suppressed by 1 mM ribose. Thus, Trg <b>mediates</b> the repellent response to phenol. Mutant Trg proteins with altered sensing for ribose and galactose showed a normal response to phenol, indicating that the interaction site for phenol differs from that for the ribose- and galactose-binding proteins. Tap, which <b>mediates</b> the attractant response to dipeptides, <b>mediated</b> a weaker repellent response to phenol. Tsr, which <b>mediates</b> the attractant response to serine, <b>mediated</b> an even weaker response to phenol. Trg and Tap were also found to function as intracellular pH sensors. Upon a pH decrease, Trg <b>mediated</b> an attractant response, whereas Tap <b>mediated</b> a repellent response. These results indicate that all the receptors in E. coli have dual functions, <b>mediating</b> both attractant and repellent responses...|$|R

40|$|Background: Drug {{hypersensitivity}} is classically {{divided into}} IgE <b>mediated</b> and non-IgE <b>mediated</b> disease. We report a rare case of consequent IgE <b>mediated</b> and non-IgE <b>mediated</b> reactions within the beta lactam class of antibiotics. Case Summary: An 84 -year-old man developed {{toxic epidermal necrolysis}} (TEN) due to ceftriaxone, a third generation cephalosporin, involving 72 % of the body surface area. The patient recovered but within weeks subsequently developed an acute IgE <b>mediated</b> allergic reaction to piperacillin/tazobactam, an extended spectrum penicillin. Further IgE RAST revealed positive results to penicillin major determinant. Discussion: This case demonstrates the complexity of drug hypersensitivity reactions. While it is accepted that IgE <b>mediated</b> penicillin allergy is a predisposition to cephalosporin allergy, this case displays an unusual correlation between drug hypersensitivity and drug class. There have been few studies that evaluate the cross reactivity with penicillin or other beta-lactams in subjects with primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins. This clinical scenario emphasizes the need of more studies on cephalosporin allergy in particular as shown by this case of sequential non-IgE <b>mediated</b> cephalosporin induced TEN reaction pursuant by an IgE <b>mediated</b> penicillin allergy...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{academic}} theology is presently maintaining the following about the critical {{thought of the}} Scottish thinker John Baillie (1886 - 1960) : (1) Baillie’s so-called "mediating theology" {{does not have a}} concept to contribute to contemporary Christian thought; (2) Baillie's concept of "mediated immediacy" is important primarily for Baillie's thought in his Our Knowledge of God (1939); (3) <b>mediated</b> immediacy’s logic about knowledge of God is severely convoluted. Received positions which support the field's marginalization of <b>mediated</b> immediacy's contemporary relevance in particular, they come with a concession: (4) the field's confusion about <b>mediated</b> immediacy's meaning—this, as evidenced in over 75 years' worth of competing interpretations about <b>mediated</b> immediacy’s logic, in particular. This thesis centers primarily on Baillie's concept of <b>mediated</b> immediacy, taking as its primary aim the resolution of research issues (1 - 4). In doing so, it demonstrates that previous research has underestimated: the staying power of Baillie's <b>mediating</b> theology in general, <b>mediated</b> immediacy’s importance for Baillie’s <b>mediating</b> theology in particular, and <b>mediated</b> immediacy’s potential as a contribution to contemporary Christian thought. Along the way, it resolves several research issues which have been occasioned by perennial confusion about the logic of <b>mediated</b> immediacy's normative epistemology and descriptive epistemology in particular. Research contributions about the logic of <b>mediated</b> immediacy's epistemology per se, these derive from three additional research contributions: a diachronic trace of the development of Baillie's <b>mediating</b> theology (Baillie research has sought a comprehensive and cogent ordering of Baillie's non-systematically articulated critical thought; this thesis provides it, by identifying Baillie's espistemic and apologetic preoccupations across his critical thought's roughly 35 -year development); a modeling of <b>mediated</b> immediacy's logic (previously absent in a research corpus whose literature ahs been replete with confusion), that logic's expression in what is found to be, contrary to the thrust of previous research, a concept of <b>mediated</b> immediacy that serves at least four functions for Baillie's <b>mediating</b> theology; and, a comprehensive and rigorous critical evaluation of <b>mediated</b> immediacy’s epistemology (also previously absent in Baillie research literature), a multi-disciplinary evaluation of it's logic (from contemporary philosophical-epistemological, empiricalpsychological and theological-epistemological perspectives), included. An evaluation warranted by the multi-disciplinary scope of Baillie's <b>mediating</b> theology, as well as by Baillie's employment of his rather versatile concept of <b>mediated</b> immediacy, this evaluation considers <b>mediated</b> immediacy's now robustly evaluated logic's consequences for core aspects of Baillie's <b>mediating</b> theology, including Baillie’s ideas of knowledge of God, divine action, divine revelation and religious experience. The definitive work on John Baillie's concept of <b>mediated</b> immediacy, this thesis is essential for those with an interest in John Baillie's critical thought. Amongst other things, the thesis challenges positions widely held by John Baillie research. For example, it demonstrates that a nascent form of <b>mediated</b> immediacy existed in Baillie's thought before the concept's first explicit mention in the <b>mediating</b> theologian's 1939 publication Our Knowledge of God. Here is a novel interpretation in the research. Furthermore, whereas previous research has rightly observed that Baillie’s critical thought gravitates toward the problems of revelation and knowledge of God in general, this thesis demonstrates that Baillie’s <b>mediating</b> theology focuses on one problem in particular— across the roughly 35 -year span of its development: the problem of the epistemological relationship between direct knowledge and indirect knowledge for knowledge of God. In addition, this thesis demonstrates that Baillie’s latter <b>mediating</b> theology (post- 1939) provides a stronger doctrine of the Holy Spirit than that found in Baillie's earlier critical thought. This thesis may also be of value to persons with broader interests, including the epistemic interplay between aspects of philosophy of religion, philosophical theology, and empirically-based interpretations of the phenomena of religious experience...|$|R
5|$|Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, {{and some}} DNAs are transported through the pore {{complexes}} {{in a process}} mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that <b>mediate</b> movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that <b>mediate</b> movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, {{as well as other}} small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; {{in the absence of a}} ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorylation is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation {{to carry out the}} two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they <b>mediate</b> or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and <b>mediate</b> the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{designs and}} statistical analyses to investigate how tobacco prevention programs achieve {{their effects on}} tobacco use. A theoretical approach to program development and evaluation useful for any prevention program guides the analysis. The theoretical approach focuses on action theory for how the program affects <b>mediating</b> variables and on conceptual theory for how <b>mediating</b> variables are related to tobacco use. Information on the <b>mediating</b> mechanisms by which tobacco prevention programs achieve effects is useful {{for the development of}} efficient programs and provides a test of the theoretical basis of prevention efforts.
