2500|$|... "On {{learning}} that I was with Crook, Crawford at once hunted me up, {{and gave me}} a letter from General Sheridan, announcing his appointment as a scout. He also informed me that he had brought me a present from General Jones, of Cheyenne. 'What kind of a present' I inquired, seeing no indication of any package about Jack. 'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth. News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a raid... I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasnâ€™t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> her (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. G. (Entering hastily, {{her hand}} bound in a cloth.) Oh, Pip, I've scalded <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> that horrid, horrid Tiparee jam! ...|$|E
60|$|I wrung <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> this absurd {{piece of}} Quixotism; {{but if he}} was {{determined}} on this deed, of course I could not stop him.|$|R
60|$|Then it was, {{and just}} as Sergeant Corney came up to us, that I {{loosened}} my grasp entirely in order to pass <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> the stranger's face and head.|$|R
60|$|Not until I {{had passed}} <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> the face could I {{believe it was}} indeed my comrade, and {{it goes without saying}} that {{straightway}} I insisted on knowing how he came there, when he should have been in London town.|$|R
60|$|Did I {{not know}} it? I never waited to answer him, but, striding across the room, I held out <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the table--to Chatellerault.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{remember}} that my prejudice against him was confirmed, {{on the first day}} when I passed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his face to compare it with his brother's." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he rubbed}} <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the cold nose and jowls of a dog. A dog it {{certainly}} was, with {{the shape and}} the smooth, short coat of a pointer.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a gruesome}} sight, from which I turned with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> ears that I might neither see nor hear, and {{trembling}} in every limb with sheer pity though these {{who had been}} thus suddenly hurled into eternity would have killed me without wincing.|$|R
6000|$|DAISY. And {{sometimes}} I didn't {{know how}} to calm you. You were frantic because you thought they were taking me away from you. [...] "I can't bear it," [...] you said, [...] "I shall die." [...] I had to put <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> your mouth {{so that no one}} should hear.|$|R
60|$|I {{slid down}} the rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with {{his arms over his}} head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a second}} titter behind him, whereat he swung round quickly, and the crimson veins in his face {{looked as if they}} must burst. He saw me with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> my mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{a bit of}} it,' I said as a last chance, with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the bellpush. 'Why, you've just {{proved that}} I know him; so there are two {{of us in the}} game, anyhow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you had to}} say," [...] {{continued}} the merciless Egyptian, [...] "was, 'This is the person you are in search of.' I did not have <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> your mouth. Why did you not say it?" ...|$|E
60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness. I put <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> eyes to shut it out, but it pressed in upon my {{consciousness}} insistently, {{and would not be}} ignored longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Warrington, I {{perfectly}} well remember playing {{you for a}} horse, which <b>my</b> servant <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> {{to you on the}} day of your departure." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} huddled {{together}} {{close to the}} trembling horses, with the thunder clattering overhead, and the lightning spurting like water from a sluice, all ways at once. There was no danger, of course, unless the horses broke loose. I was standing with my head downward and <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth, hearing the trees thrashing each other. I could not see who was next me till the flashes came.|$|R
60|$|Turning quickly, I clasped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> Paul's mouth, lest {{he should}} speak, {{although}} the lad had shown {{himself to be}} a better frontiersman than I, and this movement of mine told him of the danger so near at hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, for God's sake!" [...] says I, {{clapping}} <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth. [...] "Don't let {{the people}} hear you. They'll all go mad together if we mislead them about that signal. Wait a bit, till I have another look at it." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul {{pressed my}} arm in token {{that he wanted}} to say something; but I clapped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth. The fact that I had made a most grievous mistake was {{beginning}} to find lodgment in my dull brain, and a nervous fear was creeping over me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe you," [...] {{she said}} firmly. [...] "If {{you think you}} are going to {{interfere}} with <b>my</b> <b>handing</b> it <b>over</b> to him, you are mistaken." ...|$|R
60|$|Hardly had I {{crossed the}} {{threshold}} of the mudhouse when such a sickness came over me that I could not have looked up, though Nanny's voice had suddenly changed to Margaret's. Vaguely I knew that Nanny had put the kettle on the fire--a woman's first thought when there is illness in the house--and as I sat with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> face I heard the water dripping from my clothes to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|It was beautifully said, but I felt {{again the}} abysses {{that the mere}} saying of it covered, {{and the sense of}} these {{wonderful}} things was not a little, no doubt, in my immediate cheer. [...] "Ah, then, we're all right!" [...] I could have rubbed <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> it. [...] "I mean, however," [...] I quickly added, [...] "only as far as that. I don't at all feel comfortable about your new theory itself, which puts me so wretchedly in the wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was because}} he {{understood}} the reproof of my action, rather than of my words, that {{he held up his}} palm for inspection. It was remarkably calloused. I passed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the horny projections, and my teeth went on edge once more from the horrible rasping sensation produced.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has taken}} up with that snake of a Tory brood simply because of believing that those on the Sims {{plantation}} stand higher in favor with the red-coated soldiers than do we of the Hamilton plantation!" [...] Saul cried angrily, and so incautiously loud that I pressed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth as I whispered in reproof: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt very}} sorry for the poor child, and placed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> hers where it rested on my arm. I presume my motive was misunderstood, for with a swift glance about the {{apartment}} to assure herself that we were alone, she threw both her arms about my neck and dragged my face down to hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is war, Louis," [...] I said. [...] "You {{should know}} that. If I {{have to pay}} the penalty for taking the law into <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> the man Tapilow, I am ready to answer at any time. As for you and Delora, and the others of you, whoever they may be, it will be war with you also, if you will. I intend, {{for the sake of the}} little girl upstairs, to solve all this mystery, to take her away from it if I can." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Linux kernel {{development}} community, Linus Torvalds {{has made}} strong statements {{on the issue}} of binary-only modules, asserting: [...] "I refuse to even consider tying <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> some binary-only module", and continuing: [...] "I want people to know that when they use binary-only modules, it's THEIR problem". Another kernel developer, Greg Kroah-Hartman, has commented that a binary-only kernel module does not comply with the kernel's license - the GNU General Public License - it [...] "just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{it seemed to}} me that Horry Sims had a dim {{understanding}} of what was about to come upon him, for he lunged quickly here and there like some trapped animal, and I fancied he was about to raise his voice in a cry for help, when I sprang forward and clapped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "The dog {{was beside}} me; {{his head again}} lay upon my knees. With a feeling of awe, yet strangely enough without fear, I {{carefully}} passed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the animal's head. I felt his ears, his nose, his jaws, and his neck. They were not the head, the ears, the nose, the jaws, or the neck of Ajax! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was, but I'm not now." [...] Her {{voice was}} firmer {{than it had}} been for days. [...] "All I needed was {{something}} to do. Ross Cavanagh has been like a son to me for two years; he's the one man in this country I'd turn <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> for--barrin' yourself, Reddy--and it's my job to see him through this pinch." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Jillgall's {{eyes are}} more than mortal. At one time, they are microscopes. At another time, they are telescopes. She {{discovered}} (right across the room) the torn place in the window-curtain. In an instant, she snatched a dirty little leather case out of her pocket, threaded her needle and began darning the curtain. She sang over her work. [...] "My heart is light, my will is free--" [...] I can repeat no more of it. When I heard her singing voice, I became reckless of consequences, {{and ran out of}} the room with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "You!" [...] {{said the}} old woman, with almost a scream of surprise--"you the Master of Ravenswood--here--in this place, and thus accompanied! I cannot believe it. Let me pass <b>my</b> old <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> your face, that my touch may bear witness to my ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A gentleman, sir, cannot condescend to bargain," [...] said I, with mournful dignity. [...] "Farewell!" [...] I waved <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and crossed}} <b>over</b> the way.|$|R
