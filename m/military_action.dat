5|$|John Bellinger III, {{who served}} as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W.

The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E

5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance.

Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
