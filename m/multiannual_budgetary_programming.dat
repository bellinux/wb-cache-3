40|$|The {{rationale}} for fiscal rules and institutions has been {{explained by the}} existence of deficit and spending biases that arise due to political fragmentation within gov- ernment or between governments that alternate in office. In common pool models fiscal outcomes {{are determined by the}} decision-making rule that is used to aggregate conflicting interests into a single budget and they can affect spending bias. Several institutional responses are possible for internalizing the overall costs of <b>budgetary</b> <b>programs.</b> These costs could be internalized by giving a strong mandate to the min- ister of finance, whose role is to consider the overall effects of policies. This paper analyses a model in which the minister of finance internalizes the common pool bud- get’s externality. First, we consider a model where all ministers play simultaneously, and MF acts as a spending minister. In order to capture the institutional framework, where MF takes in account the budget equilibrium, we have modelled the interaction in a sequential way. Under this assumption the minister of finance maximizes his utility function as a leader. In a sequential equilibrium, leader’s expenditure choice is greater than in simultaneous result, while the deficit bias is lower due to agenda setting power over spending ministers...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{increasingly}} corporatized and privatized {{public university}} {{has resulted in}} significant role changes for students and faculty. Among these changes includes the development of online education and its proliferation among various disciplines to not only increase educational access, but to sustain <b>budgetary</b> <b>program</b> needs. Such processes are occurring in women's studies (WS) programs across the country, which can be problematic in terms of fostering a feminist classroom in virtual space. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine key characteristics of feminist pedagogy and its implementation and effects it has on students in the online WS classroom, considering that WS courses seek to transform and empower students to create social change. This study utilizes qualitative feminist interviewing methods to derive common themes about feminist pedagogy from narratives by students who have taken online WS courses, traditional face-to-face courses, and a hybrid of both. Findings suggest that students who take online WS courses experience a more independent learning environment and tend to lack community building in their virtual classroom compared to students who take face-to-face courses. Findings also reveal that a majority of participants would choose traditional WS classes rather than online course options. Future research is recommended in the areas of more nuanced theorizing about a cyberfeminist pedagogy and using online web technologies to build community in virtual WS classrooms...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been drawn up on {{the request of the}} European Parliament, Historical Archives Unit of the Directorate for the Library, Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services (DG EPRS). The European cast iron ingot, marked “Europ”, was created on 30 April, 1953 at the Belval factory in Esch-sur-Alzette in Luxembourg. Made with {{materials}} from countries that had long been enemies but that had now decided to share their resources, it was the symbol of the construction of Europe introduced on 9 May, 1950 by the Schuman Declaration and inspired by Jean Monnet. Offered to Monnet, who was then president of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), it is held at the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe. This study, the first part of a wider analysis on the European Parliament's role in EU budgetary powers, traces the very first phase of interinstitutional relations in the framework of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). After a brief historical introduction, the study explains the structure, objectives and means of action of the ECSC. The ECSC Treaty had a number of original features. Among these was the establishment of a High Authority, an independent supranational executive with extensive powers including the capacity to raise funds via a tax (levy) on coal and steel production, to borrow on the capital markets, and to make loans to enterprises. The Treaty also defined the respective roles of the ECSC’s Council of Ministers, Common Assembly and Court of Justice. The ECSC Treaty did not foresee a budgetary procedure: all competences were concentrated in the High Authority, which presented an annual report on its activities to the Assembly. The High Authority was the motor for managing the production of coal and steel, which belonged to the ECSC and not to its member states, and for supporting the modernisation of the industry and of the social conditions of the workers. The present research will highlight a narrative differing in part from the theory of the rules of the ECSC Treaty, and we will discover numerous features which, in spite of the 60 -year gap, point up certain similarities with approaches and problems existing today. The autonomy of the High Authority was mitigated by constant consultation/prior agreement with the Council of Ministers. The Assembly gained influence over the years, in some case obliging the High Authority to modify decisions already taken, even without a specific role being defined in the Treaty. The High Authority introduced <b>multiannual</b> <b>budgetary</b> planning, which was more efficient than annual budgets, and exceptionally allowed a rebate on the levy for two countries. During the 1980 s, the member states increased their influence over the ECSC budget (with a direct contribution based on a mechanism similar to GNI). The High Authority, in view of the cost of production in some countries, decided to introduce a rebate on the levy. It was critical of the way the Assembly’s plenary was organised. The study concludes with an overview of the evolution of interinstitutional relations, with a focus on the budgetary domain and on the capacity of the institutions to adapt and evolve...|$|R

40|$|Teaching assistants are {{represented}} by unions {{in the majority of}} large universities in Ontario and British Columbia (and in one smaller Saskatchewan university). Both traditional economic motivation and social/psychological/political factors appear to have contributed to unionization. The unionized universities tend to be in urban settings, to have large graduate student enrolments and to have faced greater budgetary concerns at the time of unionization. Graduate students in those first unionized had lower incomes than others and a higher proportion enrolled in the humanities and social sciences and the discrepancy was greater between the income of students in these fields and that of students in other fields. The refusal of labour relations boards in Canada to allow the "student " rela-tionship to invalidate an "employee " relationship contrasts with decisions of the (U. S.) National Labour Relations Board. This and the fact that Canadian public policy is generally more supportive of public sector unionization and more protective of unions during the period of organizing and negotiating a first agreement, perhaps account for the greater extent of T. A. unionization in Canada than in the U. S. Although as short-term, part-time employees, T. A. 's would seem to be unlikely candidates for unionization, T. A. bargaining is now an accepted institutional reality with collective agreement achievements to point to and dues income to draw on.

Performance budgeting refers to procedures or mechanisms intended to strengthen links between the funds provided to public sector entities and their outcomes and/or outputs {{through the use of}} formal performance information in resource allocation decision making. The paper seeks to identify and examine the literature on "governmentwide" performance budgeting systems-that is, systems used by central budget decision makers (ministry of finance and political executive) to link the funding they provide to those agencies'' performance. Performance budgeting principles are, however, applied not only on a government wide basis, but also in funding systems applied to specific categories of government services. This paper does not attempt to review the empirical literature on all such "sectoral" performance budgeting systems. Rather, it undertakes a case study of the literature on one specific sectoral system-output-based hospital funding systems.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Increasing combat demands and fiscal constraints make it critical for the Department of Defense (DOD) to ensure that its weapon system investments not only {{meet the needs of}} the warfighter, but make the most efficient use of available resources. GAO's past work has shown that achieving this balance has been a challenge and weapon programs have often experienced cost growth and delayed delivery to the warfighter. In 2003, DOD implemented the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) to prioritize and ensure that the warfighter's most essential needs are met. In response to Senate Report 109 - 69, GAO reported in March 2007 that DOD lacks an effective approach to balance its weapon system investments with available resources. This follow-on report focuses on (1) whether the JCIDS process has achieved its objective to prioritize joint warfighting needs and (2) factors that have affected DOD's ability to effectively implement JCIDS. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed JCIDS guidance and capability documents and <b>budgetary</b> and <b>programming</b> data on major weapon systems, and interviewed DOD officials. ...|$|R
