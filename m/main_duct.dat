40|$|A {{study of}} the {{digestive}} diverticula of the Anisomyaria and Eulamellibranchia revealed certain features hitherto undescribed. The diverticula consist of blind-ending tubules which open into ciliated <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> by way of short, non-ciliated secondary <b>ducts.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> open into the intestinal groove. In all the species examined the ciliated epithelium of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> was restricted to a well-defined groove, the re-mainder of the lumen being surrounded by a non-ciliated, brush-border epithelium. Each tubule {{is surrounded by a}} system of smooth muscle fibres. Cilia associated with the darkly staining cells of the crypts were demonstrated in sections of the tubules. After feeding with titanium dioxide in suspension, this substance was later found in the large vacuolated cells of the tubules. The particles of titanium dioxide were larger than o-i^t. A continuous circulation is maintained within the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> solely as a result of ciliary activity. The exhalant current in the ciliated portion of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> produces an inhalant counterpart current in the non-ciliated portion. It is suggested that fresh fluid is drawn into the tubules {{as a consequence of the}} absorptive functions of the large vacuolated cells. Indigestible material accumulates in the large vacuolated cells and is extruded into the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> where it is conveyed out of the diverticula by the exhalant ciliary current. In both the Anisomyaria and Eulamellibranchia the flap-like major typhlosole prevents material entering the mid-gut except by the intestinal groove, and isolates the rejectory currents of the intestinal groove from the general circulation of particles in the stomach. In the Eulamellibranchia the major typhlosole also acts as a valve which controls the entry and exit of material into and out of the inhalant and exhalant portions of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Venom {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a red imported fire ant colony, being used to capture prey items, for defence, and antimicrobialaction. On average, however, a worker produces very little venom (less than 1 µg/kg). Newborn workers contain little to no venom within their reservoirs, but workers that are only one-day old can produce 1.17 µg/kg. However, workers that are 15 days old only produce 0.3 µg/kg. Workers deliver 0.66 nl of venom when they sting, which amounts to 3.1% of their supply. Older workers deliver less venom when they sting, but middle-aged workers and nest-defenders deliver much higher quantities. Like all fire ant species, venom is secreted by the venom gland and is stored in the poison sac.

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} studies were undertaken {{to characterize the}} noise transmission and scattering properties in higher-order modes across the tee-junction of a rectangular duct used in ventilation and air-conditioning systems. To measure these properties, a formulation of a transmission matrix based on the transfer function and a two-microphone method was devised. The measurement of modal sound transmission and scattering coefficients is demonstrated for a duct element in a rectangular duct. The results of numerical simulations were verified by experiments. The results show that sound transmissions of fundamental mode and higher-order modes across the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> are high at the eigen-frequencies of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> and sidebranch. Weak modal coupling of the branch-modes and the traveling wave in the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> is observed at or {{very close to the}} eigen-frequencies of the sidebranch, which shifts excitation of the higher-order branch-modes at higher frequencies. A decrease in sound transmission and increase in sound scattering into higher-order modes occur with excitation of the axial branch-mode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{enucleation}} for neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors {{has become}} a feasible technique, with a reported incidence of pancreatic fistula ranging from 13 to 29  %. 1 (-) 3 This report describes the first successful case of laparoscopic pancreatic enucleation with resection of the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> followed by end-to-end anastomosis. METHODS: A 41 -year-old woman {{was admitted to the}} authors' hospital for repeated syncope. Hypoglycemia also was noted. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination showed a highly enhanced tumor measuring 22  mm in diameter on the ventral side of the pancreatic body adjacent to the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct.</b> The patient's blood insulin level was elevated, and her diagnosis was determined to be pancreatic insulinoma. Laparoscopic pancreatic enucleation was performed. Approximately 2  cm of the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> was segmentally resected, and a short stent (Silicone tube: Silastic, Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI) was inserted. The direct anastomosis of the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> was performed using four separate sutures with an absorbable monofilament (6 - 0 PDS). RESULTS: The operation time was 166  min, and the estimated blood loss was 100  mL. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 7. The pathologic findings showed a well-differentiated insulinoma and a negative surgical margin.

Between February 2009 and December 2011, 35 patients that had been diagnosed with pancreatic cystic lesions, which was confirmed by surgery and pathology, underwent pre-operative 2 D or 3 D MRCP for pre-operative evaluation. In the present study, the quality of these 2 D and 3 D MRCP images, the visualization of the features of the cystic lesions, visualization of the pancreatic <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> and prediction of ductal communication with the cystic lesions were evaluated and compared using statistical software. The 3 D MRCP images were determined to be of higher quality compared with the 2 D MRCP images. The features of the cystic lesions were visualized better on 3 D MRCP compared with 2 D MRCP.

40|$|Introduction. The {{variations}} in methods of pancreatic stump {{management and the}} volume of literature available on both main pancreatic duct and pancreaticoenctric anastomosis leak indicates the concern associated with the leak and the continuing efforts to prevent it. Herein we analyzed the role of pancreatic leakage followed by pancreatic surgery on the incidence of postoperative morbidity. Patients and methods. From 1989 to 2005, we performed 76 pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and 26 distal pancreatectomy (DP), assumed as control case). During DP the parenchymal transection was performed with a linear stapler. The surgical reconstruction after PD was as follows: 11 manual nonabsorbable stitch closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct,</b> 24 closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler, 17 temporary occlusion of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with neoprene glue, and 24 duct-to-mucosa anastomosis. Results. In the PD group, morbidity rate was 60 %, caused by pancreatic leakage, with an incidence of 48 %, hemorrhagic complication, occurred in 10 % of patients following surgical procedure and infectious complication, with an incidence of 15 %. After distal pancreatectomy we recorded 80, 7 % no complications, 3, 9 % leakage, 15, 4 % hemoperitoneum. By multivariate analysis bleeding complications, biliary anastomosis leakage, and infectious complications were consequences of pancreatic leakage (P = 0. 025, P = 0. 025, and P = 0. 025, respectively). A significant statistical difference was recorded analyzing re-operation rates between closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler versus temporary occlusion of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with neoprene glue (t = 0. 049) and closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler versus duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (t = 0. 003). Conclusions. On the ground of our results of bleeding complication, biliary anastomosis leakage and infectious complication were consequences of pancreatic leakage: failure of a surgical anastomosis has serious consequences, particularly in case of anastomosis of the pancreas to the small bowel,, because of the digestive capacities of activated pancreatic secretions.

Among 2500 patients on whom ERCP had been performed, 100 were selected who showed no abnormalities in serum amylase, urine amylase and pancreozymin-secretin test (PS test).
