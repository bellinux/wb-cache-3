Neutral, anionic, and cationic nanoparticles were made from crosslinked <b>malto-dextrins</b> derivatized or not (neutral) with phosphates (anionic), quaternary ammoniums (cationic) ligands. Then, these particles were coated or not with a lipid bilayer made of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol. Lipid coating of ionically charged nanoparticles was able to increase BBB crossing 3 - or 4 -fold compared with uncoated particles, whereas coating of neutral particles did not significantly alter their permeation characteristics across the endothelial cell monolayer. Lipid-coated nanoparticles were nontoxic toward BBB integrity, and crossed the BBB by transcytosis without any degradation. Furthermore, a 27 -fold increase in albumin transport was observed when albumin had previously been loaded in the cationic lipid-coated nanoparticles. The influence of red blood cells was studied; a marked inhibition of the transport was observed, probably due to strong interaction between nanoparticles and red blood cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Malto-dextrin,</b> {{the mixture}} of glucose, maltose and dextrin is used in food industry, as bulking agent, fat replacer, and for medical/nutritional purpose. It is {{generally}} produced from cane sugar, maize (starch) etc. by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. But presently its production rate is not so high. <b>Malto-dextrin</b> production from broken rice, a waste, is very beneficial because of its low cost and availability. In this paper, {{the objective of this}} study was to maximize the <b>malto-dextrin</b> production from rice starch by acid hydrolysis and also the effect of particle size on production of <b>malto-dextrin.</b> The rice starch was hydrolyzed by Hydrochloric acid (HCl). The range of the factors employed were particle mesh size, gelatinization pressure and time, saccharification time. The optimized gelatinization condition was 15 psig for 30 minutes. The optimized acid hydrolysis condition was 67 oC for 30 minutes. The optimized particle size was 18 meshes both for raw and parboiled rice. Maximum yield was 90. 434 % (before separation of proteins), and 94. 43 % (after separation of proteins) ...|$|R
40|$|Measurements were made, at time {{intervals}} of Me 2 CO in an aq. droplet suspended from a wire in a current of air. As a model juice, an aq. soln. of <b>malto-dextrin</b> {{was used to}} form the drop, and Me 2 CO- 14 C was added {{to serve as a}} model aroma. A film formed {{on the surface of the}} drop during drying, film formation rate increasing with increase in initial carbohydrate concn. This film was permeable to water, but not to Me 2 CO, C 6 H 6, EtOH, or AcOEt. It is suggested that formation of a membrane impermeable to aromas is responsible for aroma retention during the drying of droplets, and that adsorption is not involved...|$|R

The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} effects of a prebiotic mixture on the immune response in healthy elderly people. Methods: Healthy free-living elderly people (age, 70 years), receiving a nutritional supplement that provided 1. 6 MJ, 15 g of protein, and 50 % of vitamin daily reference values per day, were randomly assigned to receive a prebiotic mixture (6 g/d of a 70 % raftilose and 30 % raftiline mixture) or placebo (6 g of <b>malto-dextrin</b> powder) for 28 weeks. At week 2 of the study, all subjects were vaccinated with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. At weeks 0, 2, and 8 of the study, serum total proteins, albumin, immunoglobulins, saliva secretory immu-noglobulin A (IgA), and serum titers of influenza A and B and pneumococcal antibodies were measured. At week 8, culture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Chronic ethanol {{consumption}} is associ-ated with increased incidence of hepatic and pul-monary infections. To determine {{if this is}} corre-lated with altered macrophage activity, we ana-lyzed the functional properties of cells isolated sequentially from the liver and lung of rats fed a liquid diet containing ethanol (35 % of calories) or <b>malto-dextrin</b> control for 9 – 12 weeks. Hepatic and alveolar macrophages from control animals were found to exhibit distinct morphologic and functional properties. Thus, hepatic macrophages were highly vacuolated and appeared larger and more irregular in shape than alveolar macro-phages. These cells also displayed greater phago-cytic activity and random migration. In contrast, lung macrophages produced more superoxide an-ion and nitric oxide, and exhibited enhanced che-motactic activity toward the complement fragment C 5 a. Whereas administration of ethanol to rats for 9 – 12 weeks resulted in decreased chemotaxis and superoxide anion production by alveolar macro-phages, cell adhesion molecule expression was re-duced in hepatic macrophages. Nitric oxide pro-duction and inducible nitric oxide synthase protein expression were decreased in both macrophage populations. These effects were not observed after 3 – 6 weeks of ethanol administration to rats. Our results suggest that changes in macrophage func-tioning {{may play a role}} in decreased host defense following chronic ethanol exposure. J. Leukoc. Biol. 68 : 614 – 620; 2000.

40|$|Ab s t r a c t. Systems {{of potato}} starch and potato {{maltodextrins}} saccharified to various degrees (low, medium, or high) were investigated {{to understand the}} effect of maltodextrin addition on some rheological properties of starch pastes and on chosen textural properties and colour parameters of starch gels. The samples for the study were 10 % water pastes of starch alone and starch with <b>malto-dextrin</b> added in amounts constituting 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 % (w/w) of the starch. The rheological investigations included determination of flow curves at a temperature of 50 °C. The flow curves obtained were described using the Herschel-Bulkley model. The gels were subjected to texture profile determination and to colour analysis in the CIELab space using D 65 illuminant and 10 ° ob-server. It was found that maltodextrin affects the properties of starch gels even if it replaces as little as 10 % of starch in the system. As the proportion of maltodextrin in the gel increases, its flow strength decreases, the thinning degree increases, and the textural parameters change. The changes, however, are not proportional either to the saccharification degree or to the proportion of maltodex-trin in the gel. Maltodextrin present in starch gels, regardless of its amount, influences also the values of colour parameters in the CIELab system.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Insoluble {{dietary fiber}} is a known {{inhibitor}} of mineral absorption, whereas {{the effects of}} soluble dietary fibers (including prebiotics) are less known. The aim was to study calcium, iron, and zinc availabilities from dairy infant formulas supplemented with soluble dietary fibers and modified starches in vitro. METHODS: Dairy infant formulas were supplemented with soluble dietary fibers (3 %, dry wt) and modified starches (16 % pregelatinized rice starch and 1. 9 % maltodextrin, dry wt) and kept in a well-controlled and defined environment in vitro. Pooled mature human milk {{was used as the}} reference standard. RESULTS: Calcium availability from standard formula was elevated by 30 % after inulin supplementation (17. 2 %), whereas locust bean gum (11. 9 %) and high esterified pectin (11. 7 %) reduced availability by approximately 10 %. Iron availability from standard formula was increased by pregelatinized rice starch (3. 8 %), whereas availability was reduced in the following order: high esterified pectin (2. 3 %), oligofruc-tose (2. 2 %), and low esterified pectin (2. 1 %). Zinc availability was highest after the addition of pregelatinized rice starch (13. 5 %) but lowest with the addition of locust bean gum (6. 8 %) and <b>malto-dextrin</b> (5. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that addition of soluble dietary fiber affects calcium, iron, and zinc availabilities in positive (inulin) and negative ways, {{depending on the type of}} the dietary fiber used...|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} practices, {{brown rice}} syrup {{is created by}} adding {{a small amount of}} sprouted barley grains (barley malt) to cooked, whole brown rice in a solution of heated water, similar to the production of beer wort. The enzymes supplied by the barley malt digest the carbohydrates, proteins and lipids to produce a sweet solution rich in simple carbohydrates with minor amounts of amino acid, peptides and lipids. The solution is strained off the grains and boiled to evaporate and concentrate the liquid to produce a low water syrup suitable for use as a sugar substitute. Such syrups are high in the simple sugar maltose and low in glucose and fructose, due to the enzymatic action of beta- and alpha amylase on starch supplied by the sprouted barley. These enzymes produce large amounts of maltose from starch digestion and generate very little glucose or fructose in the process. Traditional brown rice syrups will contain protein (up to 10%, depends entirely on the protein content of the grain used) and therefore may be unsuitable for gluten-free diets unless they are stated to have been clarified and had the protein fraction removed through processing[...]The modern, commercial preparation of brown rice syrup differs slightly. The ingredients consist of 100% modified rice starch generated by processing brown rice to remove the protein, hemicellulose and lipid fractions. The modification usually involves heat-assisted liquefaction of brown rice with enzyme isolates to produce a solution full of solubilised dextrins (derived from the breakdown of starch) and heat coagulated protein-hemicellulose-lipid complexes. The undesirable components are easily separated and recovered as a separate food stuff or agro-residue, leaving a solution of nearly pure, rice dextrins. A similar product to the rice-dextrin (modified starch) produced by this step is often sold under the name of <b>malto-dextrin,</b> but this commercial product often employs corn or wheat flour as the ingredient rather than rice.|$|R
