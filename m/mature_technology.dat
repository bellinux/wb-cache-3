5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully <b>mature</b> <b>technology</b> which offers a ready {{disposal}} mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

25|$|For foreign train-makers, {{technology}} transfer {{is an important}} part of gaining market access in China. Bombardier, the first foreign train-maker to form a joint venture in China, has been sharing technology for the manufacture of railway passenger cars and rolling stock since 1998. Zhang Jianwei, President and Chief Country Representative of Bombardier China, stated that in a 2009 interview, “Whatever technology Bombardier has, whatever the China market needs, there is no need to ask. Bombardier transfers advanced and <b>mature</b> <b>technology</b> to China, which we do not treat as an experimental market.” Unlike other series which have imported prototypes, all CRH1 trains have been assembled at Bombardier’s joint-venture with CSR, Bombardier Sifang in Qingdao.|$|E

2500|$|Yokoi said, [...] "The Nintendo way of {{adapting}} {{technology is}} not {{to look for the}} state of the art but to utilize <b>mature</b> <b>technology</b> that can be mass-produced cheaply." [...] He articulated his philosophy of [...] (also translated as [...] "Lateral Thinking with Seasoned Technology") in the book Yokoi Gunpei Game House. [...] "Withered technology" [...] in this context refers to a <b>mature</b> <b>technology</b> which is cheap and well understood. [...] "Lateral thinking" [...] refers to finding radical new ways of using such technology. Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting edge technology; novel and fun gameplay are more important. In the interview he suggested that expensive cutting edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practical}} measures identified were: {{continuing to}} participate in international research; ensuring that the nuclear skill-base is maintained, and that the regulators are adequately staffed to assess any new investment proposals; shortening the lead-time to commissioning, should new nuclear power be chosen in future; permitting nuclear power {{to benefit from the}} development of carbon taxes and similar market mechanisms; and addressing the problems of long-term nuclear waste disposal. It went on to state that [...] "Because nuclear is a <b>mature</b> <b>technology</b> within a well-established global industry, there is no current case for further government support" [...] and that [...] "the decision whether to bring forward proposals for new nuclear build is a matter for the private sector".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} public policy measures on renewable energy (RE) investments in electricity-generating capacity made by institutional investors. Using a novel combination of datasets and a longitudinal research design, we investigate the influence of different policy measures {{in a sample of}} OECD countries to suggest an effective policy mix which could tackle failures in the market for clean energy. The results call for technology-specific policies which take into account actual market conditions and technology maturity. To improve the conditions for institutional investments, advisable policy instruments include economic and fiscal incentives such as feed-in tariffs (FIT), especially for less <b>mature</b> <b>technologies.</b> Additionally, market-based instruments such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading systems for <b>mature</b> <b>technologies</b> should be included. These policy measures directly impact the risk and return structure of RE projects. Supplementing these with regulatory measures such as codes and standards (e. g. RPS) and long-term strategic planning could further strengthen the context for RE investments. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{biotechnology}} industry plays {{a central role}} in the translation of nascent biomedical science into both products that offer material health benefits and creating capital growth. This study examines the relationship between the maturity of technologies in a characteristic life cycle and value creation by biotechnology companies. We examined the core technology, product development pipelines, and capitalization for a cohort of biotechnology companies that completed an IPO in 2000. Each of these companies was well financed and had core technologies on the leading edge of biological science. We found that companies with the least <b>mature</b> <b>technologies</b> had significantly higher valuations at IPO, but failed to develop products based on these technologies over the ensuing decade, and created less capital growth than companies with more <b>mature</b> <b>technologies</b> at IPO. The observation that this cohort of recently public biotechnology companies was not effective in creating value from nascent science suggests the need for new, evidence-based business strategies for translational science...|$|R
