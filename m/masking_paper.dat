40|$|The loss of {{strength}} of tensile specimens {{of polymethyl methacrylate}} {{as a result of}} stress-solvent crazing at 23 ° C and £o-percent relative humidity was investigated. The materials tested were commercial cast polymethyl-methacrylate sheets of both heat-resistant and ordinary grades from each of two manufacturers. Most of the tests were made on samples 0. 15 inch thick and covered with <b>masking</b> <b>paper</b> on one side only. The tensile specimens were artificially crazed by applying benzene to the central portion of the reduced section while under stress and were subsequently broken. Specimens for controls were treated identically except no benzene was applied. Photographs were taken of the crazed specimens before they were tested. Among the factors studied were the sheet-to-sheet variability of crazed and control specimens, the effect of the <b>masking</b> <b>paper</b> on the crazing, and the relative effect of a few large crazing cracks compared with more numerous finer cracks. Some of the results and tentative conclusions were as follows. Th...|$|E

In this paper, we tackle the clothing parsing problem using a retrieval based approach.

In his third year of practice, he wrote the medical thriller Kingsley's Touch, {{which was published in}} 1984. Collee subsequently worked in emergency medicine and worked as a doctor in countries like Gabon, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka. He then wrote a second novel titled A <b>Paper</b> <b>Mask,</b> which was published in 1987. Rights to the novel were acquired for a film adaptation, and Collee wrote the screenplay for director Christopher Morahan, who released the film <b>Paper</b> <b>Mask</b> in 1990. With income from screenwriting, Collee wrote his third novel The Rig, which was published in 1991. Around the same time The Rig was published, Collee became a weekly columnist for The Observer and wrote about travel, science and medicine. He kept the job for six years.|$|R
