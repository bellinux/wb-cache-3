In this article, some details in the sol-gel chemistry of metal alkoxides for making fibers are described, amd ceramic and glass fibers made so far by this technique are reviewed, being included glass fibers (SiO 2, binary silicate and high regractive index PbO-TiO 2 glasses), single component oxide fibers (TiO 2, ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3), ferroelectric ceramic fibers (LiNbO 3, PbTiO 3, Pb(Ti,Zr) O 3 and BaTiO 3), superconductor fibers (Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O systems), oxycarbide (Si-O-C) and nitride fibers (Si-O-N, TiN and NbN) ...|$|R
40|$|Quantification {{in liquid}} {{chromatography}} (LC) is becoming very important as more researchers are using LC, {{not as an}} analytical tool itself, but as a sample introduction system for other analytical instruments. The ability of LC instrumentation to quickly separate {{a wide variety of}} compounds makes it ideal for analysis of complex mixtures. For elemental speciation, LC is joined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to separate and detect <b>metal-containing,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in complex mixtures, such as biological samples. Often, the solvent gradients required to perform complex separations will cause matrix effects within the plasma. This limits the sensitivity of the ICP-MS and the quantification methods available for use in such analyses. Traditionally, isotope dilution has been the method of choice for LC-ICP-MS quantification. The use of naturally abundant isotopes of a single element in quantification corrects for most of the effects that LC solvent gradients produce within the plasma. However, not all elements of interest in speciation studies have multiple naturally occurring isotopes; and polyatomic interferences for a given isotope can develop within the plasma, depending on the solvent matrix. This is the case for reverse phase LC separations, where increasing amounts of organic solvent are required. For such separations, an alternative to isotope dilution for quantification would be is needed. To this end, a new method was developed using the Apex-Q desolvation system (ESI, Omaha, NE) to couple LC instrumentation with an ICP-MS device. The desolvation power of the system allowed greater concentrations of methanol to be introduced to the plasma prior to destabilization than with direct methanol injection into the plasma. Studies were performed, using simulated and actual linear methanol gradients, to find analyte-internal standard (AIS) pairs whose ratio remains consistent (deviations {+-} 10 %) over methanol concentration ranges of 5 %- 35 % (simulated) and 8 %- 32 % (actual). Quadrupole (low resolution) and sector field (high resolution) ICP-MS instrumentation were utilized in these studies. Once an AIS pair is determined, quantification studies can be performed. First, an analysis is performed by adding both elements of the AIS pair post-column while performing the gradient elution without sample injection. A comparison of the ratio of the measured intensities to the atomic ratio of the two standards is used to determine a correction factor {{that can be used to}} account for the matrix effects caused by the mobile phase. Then, organic and/or biological molecules containing one of the two elements in the AIS pair are injected into the LC column. A gradient method is used to vary the methanol-water mixture in the mobile phase and to separate out the compounds in a given sample. A standard solution of the second ion in the AIS pair is added continuously post-column. By comparing the ratio of the measured intensities to the atomic ratio of the eluting compound and internal standard, the concentration of the injected compound can be determined...|$|R
40|$|The 10 th International Congress on Combustion Byproducts {{and their}} Health Effects {{was held in}} Ischia, Italy, from June 17 - 20, 2007. It is {{sponsored}} by the US NIEHS, NSF, Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration (CRWI), and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The congress focused on: the origin, characterization, and health impacts of combustion-generated fine and ultrafine particles; emissions of mercury and dioxins, and the development/ application of novel analytical/diagnostic tools. The consensus of the discussion was that particle-associated organics, metals, and persistent free radicals (PFRs) produced by combustion sources are the likely source of the observed health impacts of airborne PM rather than simple physical irritation of the particles. Ultrafine particle-induced oxidative stress is a likely progenitor of the observed health impacts, but important biological and chemical details and possible catalytic cycles remain unresolved. Other key conclusions were: (1) In urban settings, 70 % of airborne fine particles are a result of combustion emissions and 50 % are due to primary emissions from combustion sources, (2) In addition to soot, combustion produces one, possibly two, classes of nanoparticles with mean diameters of similar to 10 nm and similar to 1 nm. (3) The most common metrics used to describe particle toxicity, viz. surface area, sulfate concentration, total carbon, and organic carbon, cannot fully explain observed health impacts, (4) Metals contained in combustion-generated ultrafine and fine particles mediate formation of toxic air pollutants such as PCDD/F and PFRs. (5) The combination of <b>metal-containing</b> nanoparticles, <b>organic</b> carbon <b>compounds,</b> and PFRs can lead to a cycle generating oxidative stress in exposed organisms...|$|R

Composite-style indoor air quality references, which reflect the combined effects of multiple volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{can be used to}} determine ventilation rate requirements based on building material emissions.
