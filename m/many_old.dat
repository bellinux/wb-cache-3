5|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>Old</b> Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. <b>Many</b> <b>old</b> concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E
