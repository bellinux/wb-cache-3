Established along the estuary of Seudre, which here reaches an impressive width, they form a set which overlap land and water. The countryside consists of humid green meadows and extensive gray-blue mudflats (the Seudre marshes) highlighted by golden lines of reeds, hedges, and aquatic plants with, in line of sight, the Marennes steeple forming a landmark, labyrinth of water space and light, which, in lockers shimmering in the sun (the [...] "claires"), oysters of the basin are set to refine and where they acquire their flavor and special color under the action of a pigment (<b>marennine)</b> produced by a microscopic algae called [...] "navicule bleue".|$|E
40|$|We {{are well}} known that the marine pennate diatom Hasleaostrearia (Gaillon) Simonsen {{produces}} the blue-green pigment called <b>marennine.</b> <b>Marennine</b> {{was identified as a}} polyphenolic compound. This compound is capable to inhibit the growth of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and several bacteria, including pathogens as Vibrio sp. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how strong the allelophatic effect of <b>marennine</b> is generated byH. ostrearia and identifying its minimal concentration that inhibits the growth of other microalgae. The experiment consisted of two phases of research activities. The first phase was biovolumecomparaison between H. ostrearia and microalgae suitable for aquaculture tested to take into account the differences in size of the microalgae tested(Tetraselmissuecica, Chaetocerosgracilis, Skeletonemacostatum, PavlovalutheriandIsochrysisgalbana (T-Iso) in term of H. ostrearia biomass and production of <b>marennine.</b> The second phase was the bioactivity tests, which is include growth kinetics, allelophatic effects and concentration of <b>marennine</b> in the culture medium, measured with spectrophotometer. The results of this study showed that H. ostrearia could inhibit several species of microalgae currently used in aquaculture (T. suecica, C. gracilis and S. costatum). The statistical analysis (One way ANOVA) showed that there are significant differences (P < 0, 05) between treatments andwhen co-cultured with H. ostrearia, these microalgae exhibited a significant growth inhibition. The highest inhibition value was 97. 77 % (on the treatementH. ostrearia+C. gracilis). In this treatment, the concentration of <b>marennine</b> in the culture was 5. 35 mg L- 1. According to the results, we can conclude that the supernatant of H. ostrearia with <b>marennine</b> acts as an allelochemical. The minimal concentration is 0. 23 mg L- 1 and the highest is 5. 35 mg L- 1. The treatments H. ostreariawithP. lutheri and T-Iso did not performed any inhibition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMarennine, {{the blue}} pigment {{produced}} by the diatom Haslea ostrearia, exists in two different forms, the intra- and extracellular forms. We investigated the antibacterial, antiviral, and antiproliferative properties of both of these forms. Both forms of <b>marennine</b> inhibited the development of marine bacteria, in particular the pathogenic organism Vibrio aesturianus, at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL, {{but they did not}} display any effect {{on a wide range of}} pathogenic bacteria that are relevant for food safety. Both forms of the pigment produced by H. ostrearia also exhibited antiviral activity against the HSV 1 herpes virus, with intra- and extracellular <b>marennine</b> having EC(50) values of 24. 0 and 27. 0 μg/mL, respectively. These values are 2 orders of magnitude higher than the value for the reference drug, Zovirax. Moreover, both forms of <b>marennine</b> were effective in slowing or inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. This study confirms the potential of <b>marennine</b> as a biologically active organic molecule, which could have a protective effect on bivalves, which filter seawater and fix the pigment on their gills. Moreover, <b>marennine</b> could be used in food engineering and chemistry as a natural blue pigment. However, despite that it is eaten and possibly assimilated by green oyster consumers, it also deserves in depth evaluation before being considered for use as a nutraceutical...|$|E
40|$|International audience– This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of using the supernatant of Haslea ostrearia culture containing maren-nine, a natural microalgal pigment, as an antimicrobial in bivalve hatcheries. The blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the scallop Placopecten magellanicus were used as model animals, and the pathogenic marine bacteria Vibrio splendidus was used to induce larval mortality. The hypothesis tested was that V. splendidus pathogenicity in larval rearings can be controlled by using marennine-containing culture supernatants. The effect of three <b>marennine</b> concentrations was tested on a larval rearing over 20 days for M. edulis and 9 days for P. magellanicus. At a low dose (0. 1 mg L − 1), survival and physiological condition were both higher than in the control. In bacterial challenges, larvae were exposed to V. splendidus for 72 h, with or without <b>marennine.</b> The bacterial challenge caused significant mortality when compared to controls, while the marennine-treated larvae showed significantly higher survival. Results show that <b>marennine</b> is an interesting molecule for pathogen control in hatcheries as it is active at low concentrations and significantly enhanced larval survival and physiological condition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmong microalgae, {{the marine}} diatom Haslea ostrearia has the {{distinctive}} feature of synthesizing and releasing, {{into the surrounding}} environment, a blue-green polyphenolic pigment called <b>marennine.</b> The oyster-breeding industry commonly makes use of this natural phenomenon for the greening of oysters grown in the ponds of the French Atlantic coast. This article reports the in vitro antioxidant properties of pure <b>marennine.</b> Two kinds of evaluation systems were adopted to test the antioxidative activity of marennine: antioxidant capacity assays (β-carotene and thymidine protection assays and iron reducing power assay) and free radical scavenging assays (DPPH·, O 2 ·-, and HO·). In almost all cases, <b>marennine</b> exhibited significantly higher antioxidative and free radical scavenging activities than natural and synthetic antioxidants commonly used in food, as shown by comparing median effective concn. (EC 50) values, for each test independently. This medium mol. wt. polyphenol (around 10 kDa) from microalgae is thus a potentially useful natural antioxidant. Because of its blue-coloring property and water soly., {{it could also be}} used as a natural food-coloring additive. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|In diatoms, {{the main}} {{photosynthetic}} pigments are chlorophylls a and c, fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin. The marine pennate diatom Haslea ostrearia {{has long been}} known for producing, in addition to these generic pigments, a water-soluble blue pigment, <b>marennine.</b> This pigment, responsible for the greening of oysters in western France, presents different biological activities: allelopathic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, and growth-inhibiting. A method to extract and purify <b>marennine</b> has been developed, but its chemical structure could hitherto not be resolved. For decades, H. ostrearia was the only organism known to produce <b>marennine,</b> and can be found worldwide. Our knowledge about H. ostrearia-like diatom biodiversity has recently been extended with the discovery of several new species of blue diatoms, the recently described H. karadagensis, H. silbo sp. inedit. and H. provincialis sp. inedit. These blue diatoms produce different marennine-like pigments, which belong to the same chemical family and present similar biological activities. Aside from being a potential source of natural blue pigments, H. ostrearia-like diatoms thus present a commercial potential for aquaculture, cosmetics, food and health industries...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHaslea ostrearia is {{a common}} marine tychopelagic diatom which has the particularity of synthesizing a blue-green {{hydrosoluble}} pigment called “marennine”. This pigment, when released into the external medium, {{is known to be}} responsible for the colour of oyster gills. Here we present results for main biophysical and biochemical characteristics of pure intra- and extracellular <b>marennine.</b> Tests for chemical determination show that the nature of the two forms of <b>marennine</b> cannot be distinguished and could be related to a polyphenolic compound. Nevertheless, based on spectral properties and the molecular weight, which is about 10751 ± 1 and 9893 ± 1 Da, for the intracellular and extracellular forms respectively, we assess that the pigment accumulated in the apex of the cell and the one released in the external medium have probably distinct molecular structures...|$|E
40|$|Diatoms are unicellular, photoautotrophic {{eukaryotic}} microorganisms, often forming {{colonies and}} can be found in most aquatic and moist terrestrial habitats. All known diatoms today have specific golden-brown pigment fucoxanthin that masks chlorophylls in diatom plastid, but one genus represents an exception, having the additional specific pigment <b>marennine</b> due to whom the cells appear blue. Blue diatoms from genus Haslea cause a global phenomenon of ˝greening˝ in shellfish (mostly oysters) affecting them in both positive and negative ways. In this study, historical and recent review regarding blue diatoms and physiological and behavioural effect of <b>marennine</b> as well as challenges in shellfish farming from diatom perspective is addressed. This study is also a first record of blue Haslea diatom in the South Adriatic Sea during BIOTA (Bio-tracing Adriatic Water Masses) cruise in March 2016. Investigated blue diatom was cultured in laboratory and morphologically analysed with light microscopy. Diatom investigations are very important for better understanding of the ecology of specific marine area, but also for the economy, aquaculture and tourism. The emergence of green coloured flesh of shellfish in the Adriatic Sea has not been recorded yet, but this finding of the blue diatom from genus Haslea does not rule out this possibility in the future...|$|E
40|$|Diatoms {{are usually}} {{referred}} to as golden-brown microalgae, due to the colour of their plastids and to their pigment composition, mainly carotenoids (fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin), which mask chlorophylls a and c. The species Haslea ostrearia Gaillon/Bory (Simonsen) appears unique because of its extraplastidial bluish colour, {{a consequence of the}} presence of a water-soluble blue pigment at cell apices, <b>marennine.</b> When released in seawater, <b>marennine</b> can be fixed on gills of oysters and other bivalves, which turn green. This greening phenomenon is economically exploited in Southwestern France, as it gives an added value to oysters. For decades, this singularity ascribed a worldwide distribution to H. ostrearia, first as Vibrio ostrearius, then Navicula ostrearia, last as H. ostrearia, when the genus Haslea was proposed by R. Simonsen (1974). Indeed, this ‘birthmark’ (presence of blue apices) made H. ostrearia easily recognisable without further scrutiny and identification of the microalga as well as its presence easily deduced from the greening of bivalves. Consequently, the widely admitted cosmopolitan character of H. ostrearia has only been questioned recently, following the discovery in 2008, of a new species of blue diatom in the Black Sea, Haslea karadagensis. The biodiversity of blue diatoms suddenly increased with the finding of other blue species in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, etc., the taxonomic characterization of which is in progress. This review thus focuses on the unsuspected biodiversity of blue diatoms within the genus Haslea. Methods for species determination (morphometrics, chemotaxonomy, genomics), as well as a new species, are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Photosynthetic {{pigments}} are bioactive compounds {{of great}} importance for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. They are not only responsible for capturing solar energy to carry out photosynthesis, but {{also play a role}} in photoprotective processes and display antioxidant activity, all of which contribute to effective biomass and oxygen production. Diatoms are organisms of a distinct pigment composition, substantially different from that present in plants. Apart from light-harvesting pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin, there is a group of photoprotective carotenoids which includes β-carotene and the xanthophylls, diatoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin, which are engaged in the xanthophyll cycle. Additionally, some intermediate products of biosynthetic pathways have been identified in diatoms as well as unusual pigments, e. g., <b>marennine.</b> Marine algae have become widely recognized as a source of unique bioactive compounds for potential industrial, pharmaceutical, and medical applications. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on diatom photosynthetic pigments complemented by some new insights regarding their physico-chemical properties, biological role, and biosynthetic pathways, as well as the regulation of pigment level in the cell, methods of purification, and significance in industries...|$|E

40|$|Haslea ostrearia {{produces}} a water-soluble, blue-green pigment, called <b>marennine,</b> with proven economic benefits (as a bioactive compound used to green oysters, which improves their market value). Incomplete {{knowledge of the}} ecological features of this marine diatom complicates its cultivation. More specifically, the ecology of bacteria surrounding H. ostrearia in ponds is what remains unknown. The structure of this bacterial community was previously analyzed by means of PCR-TTGE before and after isolating H. ostrearia cells recovered from 4 localities in order to distinguish the relative parts of the biotope and biocenose and to describe the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure at two time scales (2 weeks vs. 9 months). The bacterial structure of the phycosphere differed strongly from that of bulk sediment. The level of similarity between bacteria recovered from the biofilm and suspended bacteria did not exceed 10 %. On the other hand, similarities among the bacterial community structures in biofilms were above 90 % regardless of the geographic origin of the algal isolates, while the percentages were lower for suspended bacteria. The differences in bacterial structures of two H. ostrearia isolates (HO-R and HO-BM) resulted in specific metabolomic profiles. The nontargeted metabolomic investigation revealed more distinct profiles {{in the case of}} this bacteria-alga association than for the H. ostrearia monoculture.
