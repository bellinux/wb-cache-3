5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within <b>meteorology,</b> is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular <b>meteorology,</b> and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

500|$|Cyclone Lua {{originated}} {{in a broad}} area of disturbed weather that was spawned by a deep trough of low pressure and enhanced by a Madden–Julian oscillation pulse. The precursor to Lua was first identified through satellite imagery by 8 March 2012, while situated about [...] to the north-northwest of Learmonth. Analysis of the disturbance revealed a diffuse low-level centre of circulation loosely bounded by sporadic, but multiplying, convection. On 9 March, the Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Perth recognised the developing system and remarked on the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the following several days. The low pressure area meandered for several days, making some progress toward the east, and gradually consolidated.|$|R
500|$|On 1February, the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> Brisbane {{tropical}} cyclone warning centre (TCWC Brisbane) and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor a tropical low that had developed within a monsoon trough about [...] {{to the north}} of Mornington Island. Over the next two days the low moved eastwards and passed over the Cape York Peninsula before it emerged into the Coral Sea {{to the north of}} Cairns. After emerging into the Coral Sea the low continued to develop, and on 4February, the JTWC and TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had become a {{tropical cyclone}} with the latter naming it as Jasmine while it was located about [...] to the east of Cairns.|$|R
50|$|Cyclone Lua {{originated}} {{in a broad}} area of disturbed weather that was spawned by a deep trough of low pressure and enhanced by a Madden-Julian oscillation pulse. The precursor to Lua was first identified through satellite imagery by 8 March 2012, while situated about 1100 km to the north-northwest of Learmonth. Analysis of the disturbance revealed a diffuse low-level center of circulation loosely bounded by sporadic, but multiplying, convection. On 9 March, the Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Perth recognized the developing system and remarked on the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the following several days.

5|$|The storm {{developed}} east of 80°E but west of 90°E, {{which at}} the time was part of the warning responsibility for the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> (BoM). However, the MFR expanded its area of responsibility to 90°E in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that formed to the southeast of Java on 22 February 2006. Over the following few days, a monsoonal trough developed over the Timor Sea, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation from the initial low within several days. On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> began monitoring the system as a tropical low. The low tracked slowly towards the south throughout the day and the centre of circulation relocated farther south late on 26 February. By this time, the Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> anticipated the low to develop into a tropical cyclone and attain winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained) before moving over land in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Herbie {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure on 17May 1988 northwest of the Cocos Islands. Later that day, the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> began monitoring the system as a tropical low. Several hours after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 21S, having attained winds of 45km/h (30mph 1-minute sustained). Following slight development, the system intensified into a Category1 cyclone and was given the name Herbie by the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> early on 18May. Several hours after being named, the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 990hPa (mbar).|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} verification {{results for the}} current sea-surface temperature based seasonal forecasting system of the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology’s</b> National Climate Centre.

Of the three seasonal forecast variables (maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall) routinely forecast, the maximum temperature outlooks {{have been the most}} successful, while the rainfall forecasts have almost everywhere performed better than climatology. Minimum temperature forecasts have shown mixed success, {{largely as a result of}} a sequence of poorly verifying forecasts during 2001 and early 2002, although the most recent forecasts have performed considerably better...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} the drought on water {{availability}} was compounded by historically high temperatures over the same period. The Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> head of climate analysis, David Jones, released statistics showing that in 2007 South Australia, NSW, Victoria, the ACT and the Murray-Darling basin all set temperature records by a very large margin. 2007 was the eleventh {{year in a row}} that the Murray-Darling basin had experienced above average temperatures and was (at that time) Australia's sixth-warmest year on record. Jones warned that [...] "There is absolutely no debate that Australia is warming... {{it may be time to}} stop describing south-eastern Australia as gripped by drought and instead accept the extreme dry as permanent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later on May 11, Cyclone 02B {{unexpectedly}} accelerated to the north-northeast while {{crossing the}} northern Andaman Sea. At 2300 UTC on May 11, the cyclone made landfall {{just east of}} Yangon, Burma. By early on the following day, it weakened to a depression. The final warning on Cyclone 02B was issued at 0600 UTC on May 12 and indicated that the storm dissipated about 175 km (110 mi). The city of Yangon experienced wind gusts of about 47 km/h (29 mph), according to the JTWC. Cyclone 02B co-existed in a pair, with the southern counterpart being Tropical Cyclone Errol, {{which was in the}} South Indian Ocean within Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> responsibility.|$|R
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud.

5|$|Early in the afternoon, another {{supercell}} developed {{around the}} town of Maryborough, around 300km north of Brisbane. It developed rapidly also, and at 2:30pm a number of reports sent to the Bureau of <b>Meteorology</b> reported a tornado had touched down in Oakhurst, a rural area 10km west of Maryborough. However, due to the low population density in the area the reported damage was sparse, with one house destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped.|$|E
50|$|On 17 January, the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} low that had developed within a marginal environment for further development over the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over {{the next two}} days, the cyclone slightly developed further before the system made landfall to the southwest of Borroloola early on 19 January, where the possibility for further development became stifled. By 20 January, the system completed a clockwise loop before re-emerging into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Once back over water, the system quickly organised and strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Oswald early on 21 January. At the same time, the JTWC began monitoring the system as Tropical Cyclone 11P.|$|R
50|$|On 1 February, the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> Brisbane {{tropical}} cyclone warning centre (TCWC Brisbane) and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor a tropical low that had developed within a monsoon trough about 135 km {{to the north}} of Mornington Island. Over the next two days the low moved eastwards and passed over the Cape York Peninsula before it emerged into the Coral Sea {{to the north of}} Cairns. After emerging into the Coral Sea the low continued to develop, and on 4 February, the JTWC and TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had become a {{tropical cyclone}} with the latter naming it as Jasmine while it was located about 420 km to the east of Cairns.|$|R
5000|$|The Far West {{region of}} New South Wales, Australia refers {{generally}} to a fairly flat and low-lying {{area in the}} western part of the state, which is too dry to support wheat or other crops or intensive pastoral endeavours. It is west of the North West Slopes, Central West and the Riverina. It is an area with limited rainfall, and the only major rivers found in it are the Darling River and the Murray River (on its southern edge), which originate in the Great Dividing Range to the east. The region corresponds to the combination of the Australian Bureau of <b>Meteorology's</b> forecast areas of Upper Western and Lower Western. [...] It also corresponds to the Western Division established under the New South Wales Western Lands Act 1901.|$|R
