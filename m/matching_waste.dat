40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research will}} provide a scientific basis for predicting the long-term fate of radionuclides remaining with the sludge in decommissioned waste tanks. Nuclear activities in the United States and elsewhere produce substantial volumes of highly radioactive semi-liquid slurries that traditionally are stored in large underground tanks while final waste disposal strategies are established. Although most of this waste will eventually be reprocessed a contaminated structure will remain which must either be removed or decommissioned in place. To accrue the substantial savings associated with in-place disposal will require a performance assessment which, in turn, means predicting the leach behavior of the radionuclides associated with the residual sludges. The phase chemistry of these materials is poorly known so a credible source term cannot presently be formulated. Further, handling of actual radioactive sludges is exceedingly cumbersome and expensive. This proposal is directed at: (1) developing synthetic nonradioactive sludges that <b>match</b> <b>wastes</b> produced by the various fuel processing steps, (2) monitoring the changes in phase chemistry of these sludges as they age, and (3) relating the mobility of trace amounts of radionuclides (or surrogates) in the sludge to the phase changes in the aging wastes. This report summarizes work carried out {{during the first year}} of a three year project. A prerequisite to performing a meaningful study was to learn in considerable detail about the chemistry of waste streams produced by fuel reprocessing. At Hanford this is not a simple task since over the last five decades four different reprocessing schemes were used: the early BiPO{sup 4 } separation for just Pu, the U recovery activity to further treat wastes left by the BiPO{sup 4 } activities, the REDOX process and most recently, the PUREX processes. Savannah River fuel reprocessing started later and only PUREX wastes were generated. It is the working premise of this proposal that most of the phase chemistry in the wastes was defined when the acidic process fluids were first neutralized prior to storage. The only notable exception being that some silicates obviously formed later under highly caustic conditions. Waste stream chemistries for each process have been established and surrogate sludges prepared. Aging of these different recipes have begun at 25, 60, and 90 C and the phase chemistry of the different mixes is being monitored. ...|$|R

We investigated the blood ordering pattern and transfusion practices so as to incorporate a blood ordering schedule for streamlining the use of blood in various hospital departments. Methods: The study was conducted over a period of 19 months in a 350 bedded tertiary teaching hospital. Source of data was blood bank requisition forms and blood bank registers of patients who underwent elective or emergency procedures in the hospital, for which blood was ordered. Data were entered in MS Excel and analysed using SPSS version 20. Results: The blood bank was requested to prepare 10, 594 units of blood for 2556 patients. The blood utilised was 16. 04 % of total cross matched blood, leaving 83. 9 % of units cross matched but not transfused to patient for whom it was prepared, i. e., wasted. The surgery department had the highest number of units cross matched and transfused. The least number of units cross <b>matched</b> and <b>wasted</b> due to non-transfusion were from the Department of Oncology. Conclusion: The current deficiency of explicit maximum blood order schedule in our hospital is the major factor responsible for high cross match: transfusion ratio.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of aqueous nuclear fuel reprocessing, now in development {{under the auspices of}} the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), separates fuel into several fractions, thereby partitioning the wastes into groups of common chemistry. This technology advance enables development of waste management strategies that were not conceivable with simple PUREX reprocessing. Conventional wisdom suggests minimizing high level waste (HLW) volume is desirable, but logical extrapolation of this concept suggests that at some point the cost of reducing volume further will reach a point of diminishing return and may cease to be cost-effective. This report summarizes an evaluation considering three groupings of wastes in terms of cost-benefit for the reprocessing system. Internationally, the typical waste form for HLW from the PUREX process is borosilicate glass containing waste elements as oxides. Unfortunately several fission products (primarily Mo and the noble metals Ru, Rh, Pd) have limited solubility in glass, yielding relatively low waste loading, producing more glass, and greater disposal costs. Advanced separations allow <b>matching</b> the <b>waste</b> form to waste stream chemistry, allowing the disposal system to achieve more optimum waste loading with improved performance. Metals can be segregated from oxides and each can be stabilized in forms to minimize the HLW volume for repository disposal. Thus, a more efficient waste management system making the most effective use of advanced waste forms and disposal design for each waste is enabled by advanced separations and how the waste streams are combined. This trade-study was designed to juxtapose a combined waste form baseline waste treatment scheme with two options and to evaluate the cost-benefit using available data from the conceptual design studies supported by DOE-NE...|$|R

In general, we find no evidence that generators prefer “wealthier ” TSDFs or “larger ” facilities, suggesting that there is a role for smaller, private companies in the management of halogenated solvent waste.

40|$|If {{society is}} ever {{to reap the}} {{potential}} benefits of nuclear energy, technologists must close the fuel-cycle completely. A closed cycle equates to a continued supply of fuel and safe reactors, but also reliable and comprehensive closure of waste issues. High level waste (HLW) disposal in borosilicate glass (BSG) is based on 1970 s era evaluations. This host matrix is very adaptable to sequestering a wide variety of radionuclides found in raffinates from spent fuel reprocessing. However, it is now known that the current system is far from optimal for disposal of the diverse HLW streams, and proven alternatives are available to reduce costs by billions of dollars. The basis for HLW disposal should be reassessed to consider extensive waste form and process technology research and development efforts, which have been conducted by the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), international agencies and the private sector. <b>Matching</b> the <b>waste</b> form to the waste chemistry and using currently available technology could increase the waste content in waste forms to 50 % or more and double processing rates. Optimization of the HLW disposal system would accelerate HLW disposition and increase repository capacity. This does not necessarily require developing new waste forms, the emphasis should be on qualifying existing matrices to demonstrate protection equal to or better than the baseline glass performance. Also, this proposed effort does not necessarily require developing new technology concepts. The emphasis is on demonstrating existing technology that is clearly better (reliability, productivity, cost) than current technology, and justifying its use in future facilities or retrofitted facilities. Higher waste processing and disposal efficiency can be realized by performing the engineering analyses and trade-studies necessary to select the most efficient methods for processing the full spectrum of wastes across the nuclear complex.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simple and accurate method for estimating the quantity and composition of household waste arisings. The method is based on the fundamental tenet that waste arisings can be predicted from information on the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of households, thus reducing the need for the direct measurement of waste arisings to that necessary for the calibration of a prediction model. The aim of the research is twofold: firstly to investigate the generation of waste arisings at the household level, and secondly to devise a method for supplying information on waste arisings {{to meet the needs of}} waste collection and disposal authorities, policy makers at both national and European level and the manufacturers of plant and equipment for waste sorting and treatment. The research was carried out in three phases: theoretical, empirical and analytical. In the theoretical phase specific testable hypotheses were formulated concerning the process of waste generation at the household level. The empirical phase of the research involved an initial questionnaire survey of 1277 households to obtain data on their socio-economic characteristics, and the subsequent sorting of waste arisings from each of the households surveyed. The analytical phase was divided between (a) the testing of the research hypotheses by <b>matching</b> each household's <b>waste</b> against its demographic/socioeconomic characteristics (b) the development of statistical models capable of predicting the waste arisings from an individual household and (c) {{the development of a}} practical method for obtaining area-based estimates of waste arisings using readily available data from the national census. The latter method was found to represent a substantial improvement over conventional methods of waste estimation in terms of both accuracy and spatial flexibility. The research therefore represents a substantial contribution both to scientific knowledge of the process of household waste generation, and to the practical management of waste arisings...|$|R
40|$|The Valley of Innovation {{is a new}} {{industrial}} {{region that}} is being formed {{as the result of}} recent technology transfers and significant growth in the biotechnology sector. The region includes part of western Massachusetts along with Central Connecticut and runs from north to south along the I- 91 corridor, following the general borders of the Connecticut River Valley. The region extends from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, through Springfield, Massachusetts, and continues past Hartford, Connecticut, to New Haven, and down I- 95 towards New York State. Currently in embryonic form, the region has the potential to grow rapidly. It is nurtured by the technology transfers occurring at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, growth in the high technology and medical sectors in Springfield, Massachusetts, and a multitude of existing biotechnology facilities in the State of Connecticut. The city of Springfield, Massachusetts, can make important contributions to this synergy and reap substantial rewards as a key component within the Valley of Innovation. This report examines the biotechnology industry and the potential for the City of Springfield to attract and nurture biotechnology firms in the Valley of Innovation. From interviews, case studies, and analysis of data on biotechnology firms and financing, the report finds that four critical factors are needed for biotechnology to thrive: sources of technology transfer, labor force, business climate, and infrastructure. Sources of technology transfer are institutions, such as universities, research institutes, teaching hospitals, and biotechnology firms, which create and share technical innovation. The labor force for biotechnology ranges from highly skilled professionals to semi-skilled technicians. A favorable business climate provides nascent companies with venture capital, streamlined regulatory procedures, financial incentives, custom built facilities, business expertise, and services tailored to the industry. The municipal infrastructure must <b>match</b> industrial space, <b>waste</b> disposal, water supply, access to transportation links, and a telecommunications capability to serve the industry. The report includes a SWOT analysis of the City of Springfield in relation to these factors. Recommendations for developing Springfield as a high technology center in the Valley of Innovation are provided in a range of short-term (one to three years), medium-term (three to five years), and long-term (six to ten years) ...|$|R
5000|$|The 2016-17 {{was one of}} {{the most}} strange and {{contradictory}} seasons. From title contender half way through season, Tirana fell continuously to dramatically succumb to relegation for the first time in their precious history. Season started well with coach Ilir Daja and by end of first quarter Tirana had lost only one match and was 3 points from head of table. However, suddenly Daja got dismissed after the home draw against Vllaznia. Mirel Josa was straightaway appointed as the new coach. Even though furiously won the next two home <b>matches,</b> Tirana started <b>wasting</b> points home and away (especially home draw against ultimately ranked team was unattainable). To add further to the insult, an unexpected agreement between Tirana's president and red rivals in sharing with them Tirana's home stadium for the season, broke club's relationship with their fans who had always opposed such an agreement. They subsequently abandoned the matches for the entire season as result. Referees played another negative role in Tirana's doom, as further precious points were wasted due to canceled goals, card punishments or favoritism towards opponents. With only few exceptions, club never raised their voice towards this injustice.By end of half season, club dismissed several [...] "unsuitable" [...] players. And as Tirana was preparing to bring new players such as Elis Bakaj, etc in order to withstand the rest of season, they faced UEFA's restrictions due to a pending debt. This caused further shrinkage on the group's quality. By end of third quarter team was struggling at bottom four and 3 matches due to finish Tirana needed at least 5 points to survive relegation, with all possible combinations against. Ultimate round was the away match against Vllaznia who were themselves fighting to stay in the League and needed just one point, whereas Tirana needed only the win. However, after a hard fought match which ended goalless, Tirana ranked 9th and therefore relegated.Contrary to League display, Tirana won the Cup for record 16th time defeating KS Skenderbeu Korce in final after extra time. Tirana did not lose a single match along the campaign. Cup trophy also meaning participation in European cups after 5 years absence.|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility, DWPF, has {{requested}} that the Savannah River National Laboratory, SRNL, investigate the {{factors that contribute to}} hydrogen generation to determine if current conservatism in setting the DWPF processing window can be reduced. A phased program has been undertaken to increase understanding of the factors that influence hydrogen generation in the DWPF Chemical Process Cell, CPC. The hydrogen generation in the CPC is primarily due to noble metal catalyzed decomposition of formic acid with a minor contribution from radiolytic processes. Noble metals have historically been added as trim chemicals to process simulations. The present study investigated the potential conservatism that might be present from adding the catalytic species as trim chemicals to the final sludge simulant versus co-precipitating the noble metals into the insoluble sludge solids matrix. Two sludge simulants were obtained, one with co-precipitated noble metals and one without noble metals. Co-precipitated noble metals were expected to better <b>match</b> real <b>waste</b> behavior than using trimmed noble metals during CPC simulations. Portions of both sludge simulants were held at 97 C for about eight hours to qualitatively simulate the effects of long term storage on particle morphology and speciation. The two original and two heat-treated sludge simulants were then used as feeds to Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank, SRAT, process simulations. Testing was done at relatively high acid stoichiometries, {approx} 175 %, and without mercury in order to ensure significant hydrogen generation. Hydrogen generation rates were monitored during processing {{to assess the impact of}} the form of noble metals. The following observations were made on the data: (1) Co-precipitated noble metal simulant processed similarly to trimmed noble metal simulant in most respects, such as nitrite to nitrate conversion, formate destruction, and pH, but differently with respect to hydrogen generation: (A) The peak hydrogen generation rate occurred three to five hours later for the regular and heat-treated co-precipitated noble metal slurries than for the slurries with trimmed noble metals. (B) The peak hydrogen generation rate was lower during processing of the co-precipitated noble metal simulant relative to the trimmed noble metal simulant data. (C) Trimmed noble metals appeared to be conservative relative to co-precipitated noble metals under the conditions of these tests as long as the peak hydrogen generation rate occurred early in the SRAT boiling period. (2) If the peak hydrogen generation rate with trimmed noble metals is near or above the DWPF limit, and if the peak occurs late in the SRAT cycle, then a potential SME cycle hydrogen generation rate issue could be anticipated when using co-precipitated noble metals, since the peak is expected to be delayed relative to trimmed noble metals. (3) The peak hydrogen generation rate increased from about 1. 3 to about 3. 7 lbs H{sub 2 }/hr on the range of 170 - 190 % stoichiometry, or about 0. 1 lbs. H{sub 2 }/hr per % change in the stoichiometric factor at DWPF scale. (4) The peak generation rate was slightly higher during processing of the heat-treated coprecipitated noble metal simulant relative to the trimmed noble metal heat-treated simulant, but this probably due to somewhat more excess acid being added to the co-precipitated noble metal test than intended. (5) The variations in the peak hydrogen generation rate appeared to track the quantity of dissolved rhodium in the SRAT product. (6) A noble metal apparently activated and then de-activated during the final hour of formic acid addition. The associated peak generation rate was < 3 % of the maximum rate seen in each test. Palladium may have been responsible based on literature data. (7) Planned comparisons between heat-treated and un-heat-treated simulants were complicated by the significantly altered base equivalents following heat-treatment. This necessitated making small adjustments to the stoichiometric acid factor to attempt to match the excess acid contents of the various cases. The overall conclusion for the work completed to date is that co-precipitated noble metals were more difficult to activate, and were probably less active then trimmed noble metals under the conditions tested. The use of heat-treatment to simulate aging did not change the ease of activation of the noble metals. The relative ranking of the heat-treated trimmed and co-precipitated noble metal simulants was ambiguous with respect to peak hydrogen generation rate...|$|R
