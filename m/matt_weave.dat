40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between fabric weave structure and its comfort properties. The two basic weave structures and four derivatives for each selected weave structure were studied. Comfort properties, porosity, air permeability and thermal resistance of all the fabric samples were determined. In our research the 1 / 1 plain weave structure showed the highest thermal resistance making it suitable for cold climatic conditions. The 2 / 2 <b>matt</b> <b>weave</b> depicted the lowest thermal resistance which makes it appropriate for hot climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Composites of woven sisal in {{polyester}} matrix {{using three}} different weave architectures: (plain, twill, and matt) were prepared using a resin transfer molding technique with special {{reference to the}} effect of resin viscosity, applied pressure, weave architecture, and fiber surface modification. More than the applied pressure, the resin viscosity, and fiber surface modification, the weave architecture was found to have maximum influence on the ultimate composite properties. The resin permeability, which is related to fiber wetting, was found to be dependent on the weave architecture and the fiber surface morphology. Sisal fibers in woven form, with a fiber volume of 32 %, were found to improve the properties of polyester tremendously, irrespective of the resin used and the injection pressure. The maximum improvement in tensile strength was observed for resin with a viscosity of 420 cps. While the tensile strength showed a 32 % improvement, the tensile modulus showed a 100 % improvement by reinforcing fabrics with the weave architecture with maximum fibers in the loading direction, for the same resin. The flexural strength gave an improvement of 19 % while the flexural modulus gave a 55 % improvement. Fabrics with maximum fibers in the loading direction (<b>matt</b> <b>weave)</b> proved to be the best reinforcement to impart maximum properties. Finally, the fracture surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy to get an insight into fiber/matrix interactions. KEY WORDS: composites, sisal fibers, resin transfer molding...|$|E
40|$|In this research, thermal {{and water}} vapor resistance, {{components}} of thermal comfort of 65 / 35 and 33 / 67 % polyester/ cotton (PES/CO) blend fabrics woven with 2 / 2 twill, matt twill, cellular and diced weaves, which {{are commonly used}} for clothing, were determined. The results indicate that both the fabric construction and the constituent fiber properties affect thermal comfort properties of clothing woven fabrics. Cellular weave, which is derivative of sateen weave and diced weave, which is compound weave, has the highest thermal resistance appropriating for cold climatic conditions. On the other hand, the 2 / 2 twill <b>weave</b> and <b>matt</b> twill <b>weave,</b> which is derivative of sateen weave, depicted the lowest water vapor thermal resistance, making it convenient for hot climatic conditions. Besides, fabrics woven with 65 / 35 % PES/CO blend yarns have higher thermal resistance, so they are suitable for cold climatic conditions. Fabrics woven with 33 / 67 % PES/CO blend yarns have lower water vapor resistance, so they are convenient for hot climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement preforms for {{the vacuum}} {{assisted}} resin transfer moulding (VARTM) manufacturing of large composite parts {{are made from}} different layers where presence of double curvature and varying fibre orientation imposes the use of superimposed lap joints. A series of tests were conducted to investigate the compaction of jointed preforms, flow through jointed preforms and the structural behaviour of composite parts featuring superimposed lap joints. A variety of lap joint configurations was investigated, characterized by specific values of overlap length, OL, horizontal distance between joints, HD, and number of immediately superimposed joints, NS, for a random <b>matt</b> and a <b>woven</b> reinforcement. The compaction of reinforcements was evaluated using a novel thickness measurement system for preforms. The thickness measurement system utilizes Hall effect sensors. The local fibre volume fraction, vf, was derived from the readings of Hall effect sensors positioned at selected locations above the jointed preforms. Different vf values were observed around joints; consequently, simulations of the manufacturing and performance of jointed composite parts must feature variable vf at the joints. The effective permeability to resin of jointed preforms parallel to the joints was investigated. The flow of resin in the preform was different from that in un-cut preforms. Specimens cut from cured panels were tested in four-point bending tests based on ASTM standard D 790 - 03. The structural stiffness, maximum flexural stress and failure mode of specimens, were investigated. The structural stiffness and failure mode followed clear trends, while the maximum flexural stress was affected by local stress concentration at the joints. It is concluded that the presence of lap joints in VARTM preforms changes the behaviour during manufacturing and in service. This should be considered in design of parts and simulation of VARTM manufacturing...|$|R
