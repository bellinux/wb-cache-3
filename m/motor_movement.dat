2500|$|A tic is a sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic <b>motor</b> <b>movement</b> or vocalization {{involving}} discrete muscle groups.

It is also involved in motor learning and has been identified as playing a role in the motor recovery from stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Wohldmann, Healey and Bourne {{found that}} Retroactive Interference also affects {{retention}} of <b>motor</b> <b>movements.</b> Researchers found that retroactive interference affects {{the performance of}} old <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> when newly acquired <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> are practiced. Physical practice of newly executed <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> decreased the retention and recall of previously learnt movements. Despite the retroactive interference noted by Wohldmann et al., researchers noted that mental practice decreased the amount of retroactive interference, suggesting that mental practice is more flexible and durable over time.

40|$|Visual {{perception}} can {{be changed}} by co-occurring input from other sensory modalities. Here, we explored how self-generated finger movements (left–right or up–down key presses) affect visual motion perception. In Experiment 1, motion perception of a blinking bar was shifted {{in the direction of}} co-occurring hand <b>motor</b> <b>movements,</b> indicative of motor-induced visual motion (MIVM). In Experiment 2, moving and static blinking bars were combined with either directional moving or stationary hand <b>motor</b> <b>movements.</b> Results showed that the directional component in the hand movement was crucial for MIVM as stationary <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> even declined visual motion perception. In Experiment 3, the role of response bias was excluded in a two-alternative forced-choice task that ruled out the effect of response strategies. All three experiments demonstrated that alternating key presses (either horizontally or vertically aligned) induce illusory visual motion and that stationary <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> (without a vertical or horizontal direction) induce the opposite effect, namely a decline in visual motion (more static) perception.

2500|$|Hyperkinesia, {{also known}} as hyperkinesis, refers to an {{increase}} in muscular activity that can result in excessive abnormal movements, excessive normal movements, or a combination of both. The word hyperkinesis comes from the Greek hyper, meaning [...] "increased," [...] and kinein, meaning [...] "to move." [...] Hyperkinesia is a state of excessive restlessness which is featured in a large variety of disorders that affect the ability to control <b>motor</b> <b>movement,</b> such as Huntington's disease. It is the opposite of hypokinesia, which refers to decreased bodily movement, as commonly manifested in Parkinson's disease. Many hyperkinetic movements are the result of improper regulation of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. Overactivity of a direct pathway combined with decreased activity of an indirect pathway results in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons, resulting in increased motor output. Often, hyperkinesia is paired with hypotonia, a decrease in muscle tone. Many hyperkinetic disorders are psychological in nature and are typically prominent in childhood. Depending on the specific type of hyperkinetic movement, there are different treatment options available to minimize the symptoms, including different medical and surgical therapies.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many models {{attempting}} to explain how gestures are related to semantic concepts, such as imagery and speech. The Sketch Model relates semantic concepts and gestures to one another. It posits that gestures and speech have the common purpose of communication, and thus are represented at the same conceptual level. The function of gestures are then to enhance access to mental imagery. <b>Motor</b> <b>movement,</b> while [...] gesturing, has also been related [...] to phonological encoding; [...] therefore, gestural movements may prompt access to word forms and help the speaker convey their intent to others. Significantly, this model can only be generalized when gestures and their consequent speech have a meaningful relationship with each other. Overall, this theory suggests that difficult speech, such as describing motor and spatial information, will {{increase the amount of}} representational gestures produced by a speaker. Studies have supported this model through unplanned speech producing more gestures, the description of difficult figures producing more gestures than simpler figures, and a greater amount of gestures produced when participants have the freedom to say whatever they would like instead of following a script.|$|E

5000|$|This {{theory is}} {{supported}} by research on mirror neurons, or neural regions, including the premotor cortex, and parietal cortex, that activate both when individuals are engaging in an action, {{and when they are}} observing the actions of others.

40|$|ABSTR ACT: Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is a neurodevelopmental motor disorder {{described as}} an inability to inhibit unwanted <b>motor</b> <b>movements.</b> This article reviews research on the execution and inhibition of voluntary <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> in TS. Over last two decades, {{a number of studies}} have addressed the structural and functional deficits associated with this syndrome. Only a limited number of studies have assessed the motor skills in these patients but have failed to reach any conclusive outcome. In the domain of response inhibition also, studies have reported arguable impairments in these patients. It is suggested that these conflicting results can be attributed to co-occurring comorbid conditions, the constraints posed by variable age groups, lack of control measures, and lack of specificity of domains addressed. This review will describe a way in which future research can be directed to increase our knowledge of this otherwise complex spectrum of disorders.

50|$|The {{primary role}} of the {{vestibular}} nerve is to transform vestibular information (related to balance) into an egocentric frame of reference based on {{the position of the}} head in relation to the body. The vestibular nerve dynamically updates the frame of reference of <b>motor</b> <b>movement</b> based on the orientation of the head in relation to the body. As an example, when standing upright and facing forward, if you wished to tilt your head to the right you would need to perform a slight leftward <b>motor</b> <b>movement</b> (shifting more of your weight to your left side) to maintain balance. While the head is still in motion, the response magnitude of alteration to motor coordinates is significantly reduced when compared to when the head is fixated in one position.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the impact of a}} ketogenic diet (KD) on neurobehavioral development when used to treat children with intractable epilepsy, confirming the efficacy of the KD, as well as the correlation between early electroencephalography (EEG) changes in the early stage with treatment efficacy. MethodsWe enrolled 42 children who were starting treatment for intractable epilepsy with the classic KD protocol. The total development quotient as well as the development quotients for adaptability, gross <b>motor</b> <b>movements,</b> fine <b>motor</b> <b>movements,</b> language, and individual–social interaction on the Gesell developmental scales were assessed before and after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of KD treatment. The efficacy assessment was based on changes in seizure frequency after KD as recorded by the parents. We conducted 24 -h video-EEG before and after 1 month of KD treatment. ResultsDevelopmental quotients of five energy regions in the Gesell developmental scales assessment were used to compare adaptability (P 1 = 0. 000), gross <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> (P 2 = 0. 010), and fine <b>motor</b> <b>movements</b> (P 3 = 0. 000); the results showed significant differences. After KD treatment at different time points, 69. 0 %, 54. 8 %, 40. 5 %, and 33. 3 % patients, respectively, achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in seizure frequency. The reduction of epileptiform discharges in the awake state after 1 month of KD treatment correlated with the efficacy after 3 months of KD treatment. ConclusionsKetogenic diet treatment tends to be associated with improved neurobehavioral development, and more significant improvement can be obtained with prolonged treatment. The KD is safe and effective in treating children with intractable epilepsy. Early EEG changes correlate with clinical efficacy, to a certain degree...|$|R
