The introduction of this measure allows to quantify the quality of TFDs instead of relying solely on visual inspection of their plots. The method of assessment of performance of TFDs also allows the improvement of methodologies for designing high-resolution quadratic TFDs for time-frequency analysis of multicomponent signals. Different TFDs, including the modified B distribution, are optimized using this methodology.

This sensitivity to envi-ronmental mismatch is of particular concern in problems such as long-range acoustic array processing in the ocean where the array processor's knowledge of the propaga-tion characteristics of the ocean is imperfect.

40|$|In modern speech communication, noise control, {{spatial sound}} processing, and sound field {{analysis}} applications, {{it is desirable}} to have advanced microphone arrays with intelligent signal processing algorithms, which can automatically localize the acoustic sources coming from three-dimensional (3 -D) space in the environment, capture the sound sources of interest, {{and at the same}} time automatically suppress all the significant interferences coming from directions other than those of the desired sources, with acceptable system robustness. These are the main research topics of this thesis. In this thesis, several aspects of such an advanced array signal processing system are investigated by using 3 -D spherical microphone arrays. More flexible 3 -D beampattern synthesis can be realized than with other traditional array geometries, and the beamforming processing can be performed in the spherical harmonics domain, where an elegant mathematical analysis framework can be easily applied. The spherical harmonics domain based signal processing is also called modal signal processing, or eigenbeam processing. In the proposed spherical microphone array beamforming algorithms, within the spherical harmonics framework, several common beamforming objectives, such as 3 D multi-beam forming, automatic multi-null steering, sidelobe control, and robustness control, are formulated as convex optimization constraints, which can be included into one optimization framework that can be solved simultaneously through second order cone programming. Thus the global optimum solution for all these mutually correlated performance parameters can be obtained. Thus multiple <b>mainlobes</b> can be formed in the beampattern to capture the desired sound signals, and deep nulls are automatically formed and steered to attenuate annoying interferences coming from all outside-beam directions. Meanwhile the sidelobe levels of the beamformer and the system robustness against array errors can also be well controlled. In addition, the fundamental insights of the optimal spherical array beamformers, the methods to reduce optimization complexities, optimal design of spherical harmonics decomposition and higher-order Ambisonics matrices, the worst-case performance optimization based modal beamforming design approaches, and the advantages of the proposed modal-domain beamforming over conventional element-space based methods, etc., are also studied and analysed. Spherical microphone array acoustic source localization methods are investigated using the spherical harmonics framework as well, which also enjoy several advantages over conventional methods. The steered beamformer-based and several eigenbeam subspacebased source localization methods are employed to find not only the acoustic sources, but also their dominate reflections and the major reflectors in an enclosure. Moreover, the limitations of the modal subspace-based localization methods in practical implementations are analysed, and the improvements and optimizations to these issues are proposed.

A GMTI radar must distinguish a moving target from ground clutter by using the targetâ€™s Doppler signature to detect the radial component of the targetâ€™s velocity vector (i.e., by measuring the component of the targetâ€™s movement directly along the radar-target line). To capture most of this traffic, {{even when it is}} moving almost tangentially to the radar (i.e., perpendicular to the radar-target line), a system must have the ability to detect very slow radial velocities.

But the disadvantage of this approach is that the frequency characteristics of the 1-D window are not well preserved in 2-D cases by this rotation method. It was also found that the <b>mainlobe</b> width and sidelobe level of the 2-D windows are not as well behaved and predictable as their 1-D prototypes.

40|$|Recently, pattern {{synthesis}} for arbitrary arrays {{has been}} a focus of research and many approaches have been proposed. One method [1, 2] is to apply adaptive array theory. Iteration coefficients are important, which determine stability and convergence speed, but the iteration coefficients cannot be chosen easily. Especially in [1], the proper value of the coefficient {{is dependent on the}} synthesis conditions, and needs modifying by an iteration process. The value is obtained by trial and error. Although the method in [2] is for a <b>mainlobe</b> control mechanism, the appropriate reference pattern Pr(y) (y is angle of arrival) in [2] cannot be chosen easily because it is complex-valued. Its magnitude can be easily determined according to the <b>mainlobe</b> shape, but its appropriate phase cannot be chosen easily. For example, we should not make Pr(y) (y in <b>mainlobe</b> region) equal to a real constant in order to obtain a pattern with a flat top <b>mainlobe.</b> Its phase is constrained to zero in all the <b>mainlobe</b> region if we do so, which is unnecessary because we do not mind its phase in the problem of pattern synthesis.
