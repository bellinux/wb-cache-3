25|$|The Rev. Alfred Nesbit Brown, {{arrived in}} October 1829. He {{was put in}} charge of the school at Paihia. In 1835 he opened a mission station at <b>Matamata</b> and from 1838 he was working at the mission station at Tauranga. In 1843 he was ordained as Archdeacon of Tauranga.

40|$|Ticapimpla {{is a small}} genus {{closely related}} to the New World genera Acrotaphus and Hymenoepimecis. It has been {{previously}} reported from Costa Rica and Brazil. In this paper, we describe four new species: T. amazonica from Ecuador and Peru, T. carinata from Colombia and Peru, T. <b>matamatae</b> from Colombia, and T. soinii from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. All have been collected in Western Amazonia, suggesting a South American origin for the genus. A key to the known species of the genus is provided...|$|R
50|$|Argentine {{snake-necked turtles}} live in slow-moving ponds, rivers, streams, and marshes, preferably with aquatic vegetation. In coastal areas, they will enter {{brackish}} water, {{and they may}} hibernate in colder areas of their distribution. The turtles are carnivorous and eat snails, aquatic insects, fish, and amphibians. It attacks its prey {{with a combination of}} the <b>Matamata's</b> vacuum suction and the stabbing neck motions of other snake-necked turtles. Courtship and mating has not been extensively observed in this species, although it is known that nesting occurs in the spring at the riverbanks. The eggs are 34x22 mm long, white, and brittle-shelled. Hatchlings are about 34 mm long, and have more wrinkled carapaces than adults.|$|R
25|$|The Catholic Holy Angels mission {{station was}} about 400 metres north of St Paul's. Father Jean Pezant {{relocated}} it there from <b>Matamata</b> in 1844. In 1850 he was succeeded by Father Joseph Garavel. Part {{of the mission}} station burnt down in an accidental fire in 1865. The church was demolished in 1931. The cemetery remains, with a memorial pou erected in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{played a}} leading role in the {{expansion}} of the activities of the CMS. In 1833 a mission was established at Kaitaia in Northland as well as a mission at Puriri in the Thames area. In 1835 missions were established in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions at Tauranga, <b>Matamata</b> and Rotorua and in 1836 a mission was open in the Manakau area.|$|E
25|$|After a lunch stop at <b>Matamata,</b> Prime Minister Rob Muldoon {{greeted the}} {{assembled}} crowd and boarded the train. The next stop was Hemopo, where a crowd had assembled. They were addressed by Piako County Council Chairman Mr. Thomas, the MP for Piako Mr. Jack Luxton and the Minister of Railways the Hon. Colin McLachlan. Then the Prime Minister gave a speech, and unveiled a plaque paying {{tribute to the}} four workers who had lost their lives. Finally, he cut a ribbon and declared the tunnel to be open. The train proceeded to Tauranga with the official party and minus the school children where several civic functions were held.|$|E
25|$|The Return of the King {{was shot}} during 2000, though Astin's {{coverage}} from Gollum's attempt to separate Frodo and Sam was filmed on 24 November 1999, when floods in Queenstown interrupted {{the focus on}} The Fellowship of the Ring. Some of the earliest scenes shot for the film were in fact the last. Hobbiton, home of the Hobbits, was shot in January 2000 with early scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring, with the exterior shot at a <b>Matamata</b> farm, while interior scenes shot at Stone Street Studios in Wellington, shared with the Grey Havens sequence. Due to the high emotions of filming the scene, the cast were in despair when {{they were required to}} shoot it three times, due to a continuity flaw in Sean Astin's costume, and then negatives producing out-of-focus reels. Also shared with the previous films was the Rivendell interior in May.|$|E
25|$|Piri Rakau, the Waikato hapu {{that refused}} to {{surrender}} in 1864, fled into the hills behind Tauranga where they lived in hiding at Kuranui. With them were Ngati Porou followers of the Pai Mārire religious cult who arrived in exile about 1869 and Kuranui became a place of sanctuary for many people of different tribal origins. The community gave support to Te Kooti when he ventured north to <b>Matamata</b> in early 1870. Te Kooti, having been rebuffed by King Tāwhiao in western Waikato and the King Country, was trying to lay claim to the eastern Waikato. Two Arawa hapu also joined Te Kooti's rebels, but Tauranga Māori were anxious not to renew the war in Tauranga and distanced themselves from Te Kooti. Chief Tana Taingakawa, Wiremu Tamihana's son from Ngati Haua, wrote to Colonel Moule urging him not to fight Te Kooti in his land.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, New Zealand has {{sometimes}} been called [...] "Middle-earth" [...] after the fictional setting of the films. Wellington, {{the centre of the}} films' production, was sometimes called Middle-earth, and for about a week around {{the release of}} the first movie the local newspaper The Evening Post renamed itself to The Middle Earth Post. The town of <b>Matamata,</b> near the location of many of the Hobbiton scenes, unofficially renamed itself [...] "Hobbiton". The flourishing of the film-industry in Wellington has led to the nickname [...] "Wellywood", and a proposal to erect a [...] "Hollywood" [...] style sign near the airport was overturned due to public resistance and possible copyright infringements.|$|E
2500|$|The Shire was {{revisited}} by Peter Jackson for [...] {{and briefly}} {{at the end of}} [...] The Shire scenes were shot at the same location in <b>Matamata,</b> New Zealand.

2500|$|In {{the early}} days the CMS funded its {{activities}} largely through trade; Thomas Kendall, like many secular settlers, sold weapons to Māori people, fuelling the Musket Wars (1807–1842). Kendall brought Māori war-chief Hongi Hika to London in 1820, creating a minor sensation. When Henry Williams became {{the leader of the}} missionaries at Paihia in 1823, he immediately stopped the trade in muskets. The mission schools provided religious education as well as English language practical skills. The first baptism occurred in 1825. However the evangelical mission of the CMS achieved success only after the baptism of Ngāpuhi chief Rawiri Taiwhanga in 1830. His example influenced others to be baptised into the Christian faith. In 1833 a mission was established at Kaitaia in Northland as well as a mission at Puriri in the Thames area. In 1835 missions were established in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions at Tauranga, <b>Matamata</b> and Rotorua. The possessions of these missions were plundered during an inter-tribal war between the Māori people of <b>Matamata,</b> Rotorua and the Waikato river. [...] In 1836 a mission was open in the Manukau Harbour region.|$|E
2500|$|By November 2008, del Toro {{had said}} that he, Jackson, Walsh and Boyens would realise {{something}} new about the story every week and the script was continually changing. The writing hours increased to twelve each day, as they dedicated three weeks to finally deciding the films' structures. During {{the first few months}} of 2009, writing would start from 8:30am and end at 3:00pm when delToro would meet with Weta (i.e., Weta Workshop and Weta Digital film effects companies). Completion of the story outlines and treatments ended in March 2009 and the studios approved the start of writing the screenplay. [...] Filming was expected to take place throughout 2010 in New Zealand, with delToro renovating the Hobbiton sets in <b>Matamata.</b> For his part, Jackson had kept the Rivendell scale model and the Bag End set (which he has used as a guest house) from the trilogy. During the middle of the shoot, there was expected to be a break which would have allowed delToro to edit The Hobbit while sets would be altered for the second film. The director expected the shoot to last 370 days.|$|E
2500|$|W.R. Kirk {{repeated}} the later {{story of a}} taniwha (water-monster), the [...] "familiar spirit or guardian of Te Rakitaounere (also given as Te Rakitauneke) a famous chief and warrior" [...] who lost his master about the Dunedin hills, slithered down the Silverstream, 'Whaka-ehu', and 'lay down and left a hollow Te Konika o te Matamata' {{on the site of}} Mosgiel. The taniwha (named <b>Matamata)</b> wriggled down the Taieri, making its tortuous course, and when he died became the seaboard hills, including Saddle Hill. This story has associations with Kati Mamoe, ('Ngati Mamoe' in modern standard Māori) of the late 17th or early 18th century. According to tradition this period also saw the occupation of the kaik (unfortified settlement) near modern Henley – called Tai-ari like the river – and on the hill above it a pa, or fortified settlement, called Omoua. Tukiauau built a pa called Whakaraupuka {{on the west side of}} Lake Waihola and his rival, Tuwiriroa, came down from Lake Wakatipu and built one at Taieri Mouth on the coast. Māori soon abandoned Whakaraupuka, but the Taiari settlement at Henley endured into modern times. [...] (Anderson, 1998.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Paterangi line, Wiremu Tamihana, leading one of the two major Kingite divisions, retreated east to Maungatautari to block a British advance up the Waikato River into Ngati Raukawa {{territory}} and <b>Matamata</b> beyond. Cameron remained at Rangiaowhia, preparing to pursue him. Rewi Maniapoto, with the other main division, moved south into the Hangitiki Valley to defend Ngati Maniapoto bases. Ngati Maniapoto fighters and their allies remained determined to continue the war, but were divided over their strategy: whether to guard the hinterland with large defensive systems on the fringes, or to challenge the nearby occupying forces with a new pa. Rewi deferred a decision until he could consult with Tamihana, the kingmaker, and set out with a small group to Tamihana's stronghold near present-day Cambridge on the upper Waikato. On the way he encountered a group of about 140 of the dispersed Paterangi army, mainly warriors from distant Tuhoe and Ngati Raukawa iwi. The Tuhoe chiefs urged Rewi to build a pa at the agricultural village of Ōrākau, near Kihikihi, to challenge the troops, explaining that their guns and ammunition had been carried a long distance and were [...] "too heavy to carry all this way for nothing". Although he strongly opposed the plan, convinced it would result in their defeat, Rewi relented—possibly in return for the loyalty they had shown in crossing the North Island to join the fight for his territory—and accompanied them back to Ōrākau, arriving about 28 March.|$|E
