40|$|We {{present a}} novel scheme for {{high-capacity}} of 3 -D triangle meshes. Our proposal {{can be applied}} to meshes with arbi-trary topology by using irregular wavelet-based analysis. The secret message is inserted in an appropriate resolution level by quantizing the norms of wavelet coefficients vectors. In addition, a re-ordering process is applied as pre-processing in both embedding and extraction stages. Simulation results show that our data hiding framework is robust to common geometric attacks including the operations of the similarity transformations and achieves high data capacity with insignif-icant visual distortion.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new blind and robust 3 -D mesh {{watermarking}} scheme that makes use of the recently proposed manifold harmonics analysis. The mesh spectrum coefficient amplitudes obtained by using this analysis are quite robust against various attacks, including connectivity changes. A blind 16 -bit watermark is embedded through an iterative scalar Costa quantization of the low frequency coefficient amplitudes. The imperceptibility of the watermark is ensured since the human visual system has been proved insensitive to the mesh low frequency components modification. The embedded watermark is experimentally robust against both geometry and connectivity attacks. Comparison results with two state-ofthe-art methods are provided.

40|$|Establishing {{robust and}} blind data hiding {{techniques}} in multimedia is very importantfor authentication, ownership protection and security. The multimedia being usedmay include images, videos and 3 D mesh objects. A hybrid pyramid Discrete-Wavelet-Transform (DWT) Singular-Value-Decomposition(SVD) data hiding scheme for video authentication and ownership protection is proposed. The data being hidden {{will be in}} the shape of a main color logo image watermarkand another secondary Black and White (B&W) logo image. The colorwatermark will be decomposed to Bit-Slices. A pyramid transform is performed onthe Y-frames of a video stream resulting in error images; then, a Discrete WaveletTransform (DWT) process is implemented using orthonormal lter banks on theseerror images, and the Bit-Slices watermarks are inserted in one or more of the resultingsubbands in a way that is fully controlled by the owner; then, the watermarkedvideo is reconstructed. SVD will be performed on the color watermark Bit-Slices. A secondary B&W watermark will be inserted in the main color watermark usinganother SVD process. The reconstruction was perfect without attacks, while the averageBit-Error-Rates (BER's) achieved under attacks are in the limits of 2 % for thecolor watermark and 5 % for the secondary watermark; meanwhile, the mean PeakSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is 57 dB. Furthermore, a selective denoising lter toeliminate the noise in video frames is proposed; and the performance with data hidingis evaluated. Moreover, a 3 D <b>mesh</b> <b>blind</b> optimized watermarking technique is proposed in thisresearch. The technique relies on the displacement process of the vertices locationsdepending on the modication of the variances of the vertices's norms. Statisticalanalysis were performed to establish the proper distributions that best t each mesh,and hence establishing the bins sizes. Experimental results showed that the approachis robust in terms of both the perceptual and the quantitative qualities. In conclusion, the degree of robustness and security of the proposed techniques areshown.

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{increasing}} demand for 3 D digital contents has motivated us to develop techniques for watermarking 3 D models {{so that we}} can hide copyright information behind them. However, existing methods rather focused on the robustness against possible attacks to destroy the embedded watermarks, and have not fully taken care of the associated influence on the visual quality of the target 3 D models. In this paper, we present a new approach to watermarking 3 D models based on the visual saliency associated with their shapes. Our algorithm begins by segmenting the perceptually conspicuous regions over the given 3 D triangular mesh using surface curvatures, and then selectively embeds the watermark to the regions by statistically modulating the distance between each mesh vertex and the barycenter of the mesh. The proposed scheme allows us to hide the watermarks behind the 3 D mesh while maximally preserving its visual appearance, and the associated embedded information can be recovered from the watermarked mesh without referring to the original 3 D mesh.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a hierarchical watermarking framework for semiregular <b>meshes.</b> Three <b>blind</b> watermarks are inserted in a semiregular mesh with different purposes: a geometrically robust watermark for copyright protection, a high-capacity watermark for carrying {{a large amount}} of auxiliary information, and a fragile watermark for content authentication. The proposed framework is based on wavelet transform of the semiregular mesh. More precisely, the three watermarks are inserted in different appropriate resolution levels obtained by wavelet decomposition of the mesh: the robust watermark is inserted by modifying the norms of the wavelet coefficient vectors associated with the lowest resolution level; the fragile watermark is embedded in the high resolution level obtained just after one wavelet decomposition by modifying the orientations and norms of the wavelet coefficient vectors; the high-capacity watermark is inserted in one or several intermediate levels by considering groups of wavelet coefficient vector norms as watermarking primitives. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework: the robust watermark is able to resist all common geometric attacks even with a relatively strong amplitude; the fragile watermark is robust to content-preserving operations, while being sensitive to other attacks of which it can also provide the precise location; the payload of the high-capacity watermark increases rapidly along with the number of watermarking primitives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two novel methods {{suitable}} for <b>blind</b> 3 D <b>mesh</b> object watermarking applications are proposed. The first method is robust against 3 D rotation, translation, and uniform scaling. The second one is robust against both geometric and mesh simplification attacks. A pseudorandom watermarking signal is {{cast in the}} 3 D mesh object by deforming its vertices geometrically, without altering the vertex topology. Prior to watermark embedding and detection, the object is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal component coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This geometrical transformation ensures watermark robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to uniform scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r,,) spherical coordinate system. In the first method, a set of vertices that correspond to specific angles is used for watermark embedding. In the second method, the samples of the watermark sequence are embedded {{in a set of}} vertices that correspond to a range of angles in the domain in order to achieve robustness against mesh simplifications. Experimental results indicate the ability of the proposed method to deal with the aforementioned attacks.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a fragile watermarking scheme for authentication of 3 D semi-regular meshes. After one wavelet decomposition, the watermark is inserted by slightly modifying the norms and orientations of the obtained wavelet coefficient vectors. The inserted watermark is robust {{to the so-called}} content-preserving attacks including vertex reordering and similarity transformations. However, it is vulnerable to others attacks such as local and global geometric modifications and remeshing since {{the objective is to}} check the integrity of the mesh. Additionally, according to the watermark extraction result, these attacks can be precisely located {{on the surface of the}} attacked <b>mesh</b> in a <b>blind</b> way. Sufficient security level is also achieved by introducing secret keys and by using scalar Costa quantization scheme with appropriate parameter values.

40|$|International audienceAfter the sound, 2 D {{images and}} videos, 3 D models {{represented}} by polygonal meshes are the actual emergent content {{due to the}} technological advance in terms of 3 D acquisition. 3 D meshes can be subject to several degradations due to acquisition, compression, pre-treatment or transmission that distort the 3 D mesh and therefore affect its visual rendering. Because the human observer is generally located {{at the end of}} this line, quality assessment of the content is required. We propose in this paper a view-independent 3 D <b>Blind</b> <b>Mesh</b> Quality Assessment Index (BMQI) based on the estimation of visual saliency and roughness. Given a 3 D distorted mesh, the metric can assess the percieved visual quality without the need of the reference content as humans do. No assumption on the degradation to evaluate is required for this metric, which makes it powerful and usable in any context requiring quality assessment of 3 D meshes. Obtained results in terms of correlation with subjective human scores of quality are important and highly competitive with existing full-reference quality assessment metrics...|$|R

The watermark can be extracted without the original image and 3 D model. Those two methods have high embedding capacity for 3 D meshes. Meanwhile, they are robust against geometric transformation (like translation, rotation, uniform scaling) and vertex reordering attacks.

40|$|AbstractThe {{advantages}} of using copepods in aquaculture include nutritional superiority, high digestibility and {{broad spectrum of}} sizes, {{with the possibility of}} bioencapsulation of nutrients, probiotics and medicines. This study aimed to compare the effects of feeding copepods with a microalgae diet and two commercial inert diets on the copepod culture performance and their fatty acid profile. Wild copepods were collected in the estuarine system of Piraquê-açu River, Aracruz, Espírito Santo, Brazil, with a conical net of 60 cm in diameter and 200 &# 956;m <b>mesh</b> with a <b>blind</b> cup end, towed through the subsurface layer at a speed of 1 knot for 5 minutes. Once collected, the material was sieved in order to select only Oithona hebes. The experiment was conducted in nine cylindrical-conical tanks with a 60 L capacity, salinity of 25. 8 ± 1. 3, temperature of 25. 5 ± 0. 5 ºC and weak aeration, stocked with a density of 1. 5 copepod/mL. Treatments were made in triplicate and consisted of: Treatment 1 (Control) fed with microalgae Chaetoceros gracilis and Nannochloropsis oculata (1 : 1) with 50, 000 cells. mL- 1 each; Treatment 2 with S. Parkle® INVE (1 g. million- 1); and Treatment 3 with freeze-dried spirulina (1 g. million- 1). The mean final population was compared by a Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results showed higher population growth for copepods treated with S. parkle, which was the only treatment that presented copepodites. S. parkle was a good source of total lipids (9. 54 g. 100 g- 1 dry weight), high availability of DHA, EPA and had a good DHA:EPA:ARA ratio of 12. 4 : 3. 4 : 1. 0. Copepods that were fed S. parkle had the highest DHA levels and a DHA:EPA:ARA ratio of 15. 4 : 2. 2 : 1. 0. This study showed that S. parkle is a good inert food for rearing the copepod O. hebes, demonstrating the ability of copepods to bioencapsulate nutrients, allowing their transfer in the food chain...|$|R
