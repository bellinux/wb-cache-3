40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether the apparent additional and exceptional stresses associated with bearing and parenting twins affect the emotional wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>mothers.</b> SETTING [...] Great Britain, 1970 - 5. DESIGN Cohort study of 13, 135 children born between 4 April and 11 April 1970. <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> all children, both singletons and twins, were interviewed by health visitors (providing demographic data) and completed a self report measure of emotional well-being (the Rutter malaise inventory) when the child was 5 years of age. The malaise scores <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins were compared with those <b>of</b> all <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons and then with those <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> categorised by the age spacing of their children (only one child, widely spaced, or closely spaced), taking account of maternal age, social class, and whether the study child had a disability, by using logistic regression. SUBJECTS 139 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins [...] 122 pairs of twins and 17 twins whose cotwin had died [...] and 12, 573 controls, who were <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons. RESULTS A significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins at 5 years had malaise scores indicative <b>of</b> depression than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons at the same age. Mothers who had borne twins, one of whom had subsequently died, had the highest malaise scores and were {{three times more likely}} than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons to experience depression.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} authoritative parenting and associations with parenting sense {{of competence and}} social support in Chinese <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability and <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children. One hundred and sixty-seven <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability {{with a mean age}} of 10. 89 years (SD[*]=[*] 1. 74) and 119 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children {{with a mean age of}} 10. 55 years (SD[*]=[*] 1. 10) participated in a survey. <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability reported similar levels of parental warmth, and less use of reasoning and autonomy support compared with <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children. Parenting efficacy contributed uniquely to three dimensions of authoritative parenting for <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability. By comparison, parenting efficacy did not contribute to use of reasoning and autonomy support for <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children. Social support made a unique but small contribution to parental warmth but not to parental reasoning and autonomy support for <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability. For <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children, social support was associated with both parental warmth and autonomy support. This study suggests that child disability status is related to maternal authoritative parenting, and additionally, parenting efficacy plays a more critical role in predicting authoritative parenting <b>of</b> Chinese <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disability than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> typically developing children...|$|R

For <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> toddlers, lower levels of emotion-focused coping {{and higher levels of}} problem-focused coping were generally associated with better maternal well-being, regardless of the level of child symptomatology. For <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> adolescents, coping often acted as a buffer when autism symptoms were high.

40|$|Background: Despite recent {{interest}} in relationships between maternal gesture and speech and communicative development in typically developing (M) children, little work has examined either speech or gesture in <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with Down's syndrome (DS). Aims: To compare aspects {{of speech and}} gesture production by <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS with that <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children. Methods & Procedures: Participants were five <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS (mean chronological age (CA) = 47. 6 months; mean mental age (MA,) = 22. 4 months) and five <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children. To equate for expressive language ability, children in the TD and DS groups were individually matched on the basis of: (1) gender; (2) correspondence between the TD child's chronological age and the DS child's language age; and (3) observed expressive vocabulary size. Each mother-child dyad was videotaped for approximately 30 min during free play. Data analyses focused on: (1) the number and types (speech only, gesture only, mixed) of maternal utterances; (2) the gesture types (deictic, iconic, conventional, emphatic); and (3) for mixed utterances, the structure and the temporal patterning of spoken and gestured components. Outcomes & Results: Relative to <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children, <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS produced significantly fewer utterances overall, but the distribution of utterance types did not differ between the two groups. Relative to <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children, <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS used proportionately more deictic gestures and made more frequent use <b>of</b> SHOWING. <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children produced more POINTING gestures. Finally, <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS produced a significantly higher proportion of utterances consisting of a single gesture and a single verbal utterance; in contrast to <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children, more complex structures (one gesture with multiple verbal utterances, one verbal utterance with multiple gestures) were never observed. Within the category of utterances consisting of a gesture and a single verbal utterance, <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with DS tended to produce gestures that were held throughout the complete verbal utterance, while the gestures <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> TD children tended to co-occur with {{only a portion of}} the utterance.
