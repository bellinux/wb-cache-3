5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from normal use. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes {{in one of the}} metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E
5|$|It {{may also}} appear suspect because similar events are not {{observed}} in other ice ages (Hemming 2004), although this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> {{to the lack}} of high-resolution sediments.|$|E
5|$|Local legends {{associate}} it with Arthurian England and Camelot, {{though these}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to confusion with the better-known Cadbury Castle, near South Cadbury some 50miles to the south.|$|E
30|$|Occasionally, pseudohypertrophy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>due</b> to partial {{averaging}} {{of normal}} structures. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>due</b> to a prominent moderator band, which may give a false impression of septal hypertrophy (Movies 1 and 2).|$|R

5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins—though it has been suggested this fact <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due,</b> in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} no speaker audio for {{services}} like web radio even though the speaker works fine when used as a telephone. This error <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to a malfunctioning switch sensing the headphone plug and different handling of this information by different apps.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of Lastarria's gases {{has changed over}} time, {{with an increase in}} the magmatic component between 2009 and 2012, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> either to different measurement methods or to changes in the volcanic activity at Lastarria.|$|E
50|$|A {{reason a}} proof {{banknote}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> rejected is the colour is not suitable. Another reason a proof banknote <b>may</b> <b>be</b> rejected <b>is</b> <b>due</b> {{to the design}} itself being unsuitable.|$|R

50|$|It can be {{associated}} with digitalis toxicity. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> also <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to onset of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, conduction system diseases with enhanced automaticity, or administration of theophylline.|$|R
5|$|The {{slopes of}} Licancabur are {{unstable}} {{and prone to}} rock falls. Some of the instability <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer to climb the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{sometimes}} {{appear to}} age under great stress. Círdan {{appeared to be}} aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of Gwindor of Nargothrond had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the splash dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other Cyathus species. This reduced ejection distance <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to such factors as the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the splash cup.|$|E
5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment {{has also been}} demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the Pb2+(aq) ion, {{which has}} a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors {{have not been}} found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally it may be found in a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis the cancer has usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like.|$|E
5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> both {{to the fact that}} few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, {{as well as to the}} fact that the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military protection.|$|E

50|$|Various pathologies, listed below, {{can lead}} to volume overload. Different {{mechanisms}} are involved depending on the cause, however the common theme {{is that of a}} high cardiac output with a low or normal afterload. The output <b>may</b> <b>be</b> high <b>due</b> to the inefficiency in valve disease, or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> high <b>due</b> to shunting of blood in left-to-right shunts and arteriovenous malformations.|$|R

5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to some degree, this void <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the lack of will to record their history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{progress}} in preventing the disease may in part {{be due to}} stigma associated with TB. Stigma <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{geographic}} {{variation in}} the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia. These differences <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to population genetics, environmental factors, or a combination of the two.|$|E
