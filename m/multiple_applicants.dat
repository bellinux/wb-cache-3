50|$|Matching Programs place {{applicants}} into positions {{based on}} lists of preferred choices submitted by applicants and recruiters. A Matching Program eliminates premature {{decisions based on}} incomplete information by allowing all offers, acceptances or rejections to occur at the same time. Therefore many common adverse situations are eliminated from the recruitment process, such as <b>applicants</b> hoarding <b>multiple</b> offers, <b>applicants</b> reneging on a prior acceptance in order to accept a more preferred subsequent offer, and recruiters overfilling the number of positions available. Applicants and recruiters benefit from having full choice of all potential placements. The best strategy for both applicants and recruiters is to submit preference lists that reflect their true preferences.|$|R

An employer may use a single LCA for <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> as long as they all fall within the same category (i.e., they must all be in a single one of the categories: H-1B, H-1B1-Singapore, H-1B1-Chile, E-3).|$|E
50|$|In {{the group}} {{interview}}, <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> are interviewed {{at one time}} {{by one or more}} interviewers. This type of interview can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a group interview to assess an applicant’s stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained. These positive qualities of the group interview have made them more popular.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} job applicant body weight on employability ratings via the mediators of obesity and physical attractiveness stereotypes, organizational costs, and rational bias. The moderating effect of job type was also examined. A sample of 202 (75 % female) university students assessed a job applicant {{on the basis of}} a résumé which was accompanied by a photograph (overweight vs. average weight) and a position description (face-to-face vs. telephone sales). Results revealed that the overweight applicant was rated significantly higher on the obesity stereotype, significantly lower on the physical attractiveness stereotype, and as significantly less employable. Stereotypes failed to mediate between applicant weight and employability, and rational bias only was found to be a significant mediator. There was no significant interaction between applicant weight and job type when the mediators were controlled. Our findings in this study underscore the importance of examining <b>multiple</b> pathways from <b>applicant</b> weight to employment-related weight discrimination...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of applicants to Canadian medical schools for 1965 - 66 revealed that 4660 applications were {{received by the}} 12 schools for approximately 900 places available; 2852 of these were from Canadians, but because many applicants applied {{to more than one}} school, these 2852 applications represented only 1767 individuals. Evaluations made by the schools concerning the acceptability of these applicants showed that only 36 persons rated as “acceptable” by one or more schools failed to gain admission to any Canadian school for 1965 - 66. Furthermore, 66 “marginal” applicants were accepted, as were 130 <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> who were rated as “acceptable” by one school but “marginal” and/or “unacceptable” by one or more other schools. Of the 464 <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants,</b> only 40 % received the same evaluation from all schools to which they applied. If those <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> who were rated as acceptable by all schools to which they applied are added to single applicants rated as acceptable, the pool of these clearly acceptable candidates (40 % of all Canadian applicants) is sufficient only to fill 78 % of places available.

50|$|With Lee's skill, and equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics {{being held}} in Hong Kong rather than Beijing {{with the rest of}} events, it was a natural next step for her to attempt to participate, but her road to the Olympics was filled with obstacles. Lee, along with fellow U.S. citizen showjumpers Jennifer Chang and Charlotte Morse and U.K. citizen {{dressage}} rider Aram Gregory, were not successful in obtaining special dispensations from the International Olympic Committee to compete for Hong Kong without holding Chinese nationality. Among them, Lee and Gregory chose to apply to for naturalisation as Chinese nationals to the Hong Kong Immigration Department, which is authorised by Beijing to process Chinese nationality applications from Hong Kong residents. People of Chinese descent born in Hong Kong are permitted to hold <b>multiple</b> citizenship; however, <b>applicants</b> for naturalisation are required to renounce all other citizenships they hold. This was a difficult decision for Lee, in particular due to her concerns about her ability to travel back to her former home to care for her ageing parents; the U.S. is alone among Western countries in not granting visa-free treatment to holders of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports, meaning she would have to apply for a United States visa, and could face the possibility of rejection.|$|R
40|$|Senate Bill SB 1209 (Chap. 517, Stats. 2006) {{was signed}} by the Governor on September 28, 2006. One of the changes made by SB 1209 was to add five new options to meet the basic skills requirement, in {{addition}} to passage of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). This correspondence is an update on three of the new options. Key Provisions: SB 1209 allows six options for meeting the basic skills requirement. However, three of the options will not be available at this time as passing scores have not been established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. These three options are: � Passage of the ACT Plus Writing examination; � Passage of the GRE (Graduate Record) examination; and � Passage of the SAT Reasoning examination. The current options to meet the basic skills requirement are: � Passage of the CBEST; � Passage of a basic skills examination from another state; and � Passage of the revised CSET: Multiple Subjects examination (CSET: Multiple Subjects Plus Writing Skills) which includes an assessment of writing skills. Background: Since 1983, CBEST {{has been the only}} option for meeting the state requirement for basic skills proficiency. The current three options to meet the basic skills requirement may be used to satisfy the basic skills requirement for all types of documents requiring that basic skills be met.

40|$|We analyze race {{discrimination}} in labor markets in which wage offers are posted. If employers with job vacancies receive <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants,</b> they choose {{the most qualified}} but may choose arbitrarily among equally qualified applicants. In the model, firms post wages, workers choose where to apply, and firms decide which workers to hire. Labor-market frictions greatly amplify racial disparities, so mild discriminatory tastes or small productivity differences can produce large wage differentials between the races.

When there are <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> competition drives the workers down to their continuation value. By attracting more applicants, a binding wage floor provides a means for firms to increase matching rates and improve match quality.

40|$|In {{organizational}} research, many multilevel {{structures are}} not fully nested but have a crossover structure. For example, in early recruitment study, the relation-ship between job applicants and recruiting companies has the crossover structure because each applicant is interested in applying multiple companies whereas each company is of interest to <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants,</b> and applicants and companies {{are not fully}} nested within each other. This article introduces the crossover linear modeling (CLM) method and argues that CLM is useful when dealing with multi-level crossover structures by combining the heterogeneities of all levels into one model. The article uses an example in early recruitment research to illustrate the use of CLM in modeling direct effects, cross-level effects, and interaction effects in a crossover data structure. The statistical analysis on an actual data set shows that CLM is able to identify both company-level and applicant-level heterogeneities. The article presents further examples to show that CLM {{can be applied to}} many organizational research settings when multilevel crossover structures are present...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} EU’s {{accession}} negotiations with Bulgaria and Turkey {{to assess the}} conditions under which their negotiations unfolded and the role of bilateral issues in that aspect. To do so, the paper highlights the role of the member state vetoes and bilateral relations in the EU negotiations. It needs to be noted that even though the European Commission condemns the impact of bilateral problems on the accession process, unresolved bilateral issues, nonetheless, emerge as major factors complicating the EU’s enlargement process, its effectiveness as well as the pace and nature of the negotiations with <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> and candidates. We look at role of individual member states as veto players on the EU accession negotiations, specifically becoming {{the most important factor in}} the Turkish case. We limit our focus to the lack of consensus and commitment among the EU member states towards Turkey as a complicating factor in the EU negotiations. We are able to ascertain that a key difference between Bulgaria and Turkey with regards to their EU accession was the member state vetoes for Turkey’s negotiations...|$|E
40|$|Technical {{innovations}} {{have converged}} with the exploding market demand for mobile telecommunications {{to create the}} impetus for low-earth orbit (LEO) communications satellite systems. The so-called 'Little LEO's' propose use of VHF and UHF spectrum to provide position - location and data messaging services. The so-called 'Big LEO's' propose to utilize the RDSS bands to provide voice and data services. In the United States, several applications were filed with the U. S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to construct and operate these mobile satellite systems. To enable the prompt introduction of such new technology services, the FCC is using innovative approaches to process the applications. Traditionally, when the FCC is faced with 'mutually exclusive' applications, e. g. a grant of one would preclude a grant of the others, it uses selection mechanisms such as comparative hearings or lotteries. In {{the case of the}} LEO systems, the FCC has sought to avoid these time-consuming approaches by using negotiated rulemakings. The FCC's objective is to enable the <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants</b> and other interested parties to agree on technical and service rules which will enable the grant of all qualified applications. With regard to the VHF/UHF systems, the Advisory Committee submitted a consensus report to the FCC. The process for the systems operating in the bands above 1 GHz involved more parties and more issues but still provided the FCC useful technical information to guide the adoption of rules for the new mobile satellite service...|$|E
40|$|The {{obligations}} {{deriving from}} {{participation in the}} World Trade Organization are never inherently indivisible or erga omnes in the sense elaborated by the International Court of Justice {{in the field of}} human rights. As a rule, remedies for violations of WTO obligations remain available only to the Member(s) whose international trade interests have been affected, in actual or potential terms. Nonetheless, contracting parties have decided to extend to a limited number of WTO obligations the legal regime of indivisible obligation and to consider immaterial for the purpose of resorting to the dispute settlement system the effects of their violations. WTO obligations, therefore, are not a monolithic bloc. They may be divided into two categories which are governed by different rules as far as legal standing and counter-measures are concerned. Depending on whether the obligation allegedly breached belongs to one or the other category, the nullification or impairment of benefits is presumed – but can be challenged – under Article 3 (8) of the DSU or is entirely irrelevant. Furthermore, countermeasures are normally proportionate or equivalent to the nullification or impairment of the benefits of the complainant. In the case of WTO obligations treated as indivisible obligations, however, the effects of the violation are immaterial and the trade interests of the complainant may well be unaffected. As a result, counter-measures are to be permitted {{to the extent that they}} will effectively ensure compliance. Special problems may finally arise in the case of <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants,</b> especially when the countermeasures are authorized at different times...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{recruitment}} {{process is}} demanding, {{especially when there}} are many good candidates. Failure in this process can be expensive. Typically interviews and different psychological tests are used {{to help in the}} selection. The problem is that interviews and tests are costly. Here a new, partly automated approach is presented. The new approach was tested in the Tenure Track process at the Tampere University of Technology. The new approach consisted of two parts. Firstly, the candidates used the on-line Evolute Helix application [1]. They responded to 237 claims and gave their degree of agreement with each claim. This part produced data measuring commitment. Secondly, the gathered data, i. e. profiles of commitment, were analyzed to find clusters of similar candidates. These clusters were checked against the desired profile. These two parts were automated. The test data were based on the Tenure Track process at the Tampere University of Technology. Recruitment to universities nowadays largely follows the same principles as the normal recruitment process in companies and other organizations. Universities have started to play a global game in their recruitment and try to find the best possible candidates internationally for their universities. In this case example we show how an organizational commitment application that has been developed could help the recruitment process, in which 55 candidates were applying for two tenure track positions. The application used, Evolute Helix, was useful in the recruitment process and helped in the interviews as well as the selection of applicants for the shortlist. The shortlist consisted of six candidates, who were finally interviewed. The two winners were selected from among these candidates. Commitment can reveal many personal characteristics and also the future aspirations and motivations of applicants. The tested application can also be used afterwards, as the tenure track of the chosen person continues in the university. Automatic preprocessing is a great aid when sifting out desired candidates from <b>multiple</b> <b>applicants...</b>|$|E
