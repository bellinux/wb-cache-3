5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual <b>manufacturing</b> <b>error,</b> found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Hampered by terrible pain in {{his left}} knee during the 1960–61 NHL season, Plante was sent down to the minor league Montreal Royals. Torn {{cartilage}} was found in his knee, and the knee was surgically repaired {{during the summer of}} 1961. The next season Plante became only the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy – he also won the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time. The 1962–63 season was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, Toe Blake, continued to deteriorate because of Plante's persistent health problems. Later, Plante {{was at the center of}} a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His claim was later confirmed as the result of a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E

500|$|At {{secondary}} sites {{he would}} remove and later burn the victim's clothing, or {{in at least}} one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin. Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him. (A <b>manufacturing</b> <b>error</b> in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.) He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia, and to groom or dress up the cadavers. Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen. He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims.

2500|$|A Björk {{concert was}} filmed at L'Olympia in Paris, France {{during the last}} leg of the Volta tour and a small concert in Reykjavík, Iceland {{straight}} after the tour had finished. The [...] "Volta Revisited" [...] collection eventually surfaced as Voltaïc and was to include a live DVD among 3 other discs, although manufacturing problems lead to a delay of up to six months for its release. One <b>manufacturing</b> <b>error</b> led to 20,000 copies of the box-set having to be destroyed, and with a remanufacture necessary, Björk decided to make changes to the track listing resulting in four songs being cut from the live DVD. Towards the end of April 2009 Universal Europe accidentally shipped their copies of Voltaïc early. A statement released by One Little Indian stated that the projected release date was meant to be June 2009 as they wanted all three versions of Voltaïc to be available upon official release - the early shipment by Universal Europe was only of the Deluxe Edition. However, UK-based music retailer CD Wow was found to be for a brief period selling un-cut copies of the box set, before its official release. These copies, which had allegedly been destroyed, were manufactured in Malaysia - and as such contained more tracks than the other released (cut) editions. Voltaïc eventually enjoyed its full official release on June 23, 2009.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{two problems}} related to 3 D camera calibration using a single mono-plane calibration target with circular control marks. The first problem is how to compute accurately {{the locations of the}} features (ellipses) in images of the target.

Our experiments have shown this technique generates more accurate feature locations than the state-of-the-art ellipse extraction methods. The second problem is how to refine the control mark locations with unknown <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors.</b> We demonstrate in a case study, where the control marks are laser printed on a A 4 paper, that the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors</b> of the control marks can be compensated to a good extent so that the remaining calibration errors are reduced significantly. 1...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{background}} for calculation of k-h-v type cycloid reducers was developed relatively long ago. However, recently the matters of cycloid reducer design again attracted heightened attention. The {{reason for that}} is that such devices are used in many complex engineering systems, particularly, in mechatronic and robotics systems. The development of advanced technological capabilities for manufacturing of such reducers today gives the possibility for implementation of essential features of such devices: high efficiency, high gear ratio, kinematic accuracy and smooth motion. The presence of an adequate mathematical model gives the possibility for adjusting kinematic accuracy of the reducer by rational selection of manufacturing tolerances for its parts. This makes it possible to automate the design process for cycloid reducers with account of various factors including technological ones. A mathematical model and mathematical technique have been developed giving the possibility for modeling the kinematic error of the reducer with account of multiple factors, including <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors.</b> The errors are considered in the way convenient for prediction of kinematic accuracy early at the manufacturing stage according to the results of reducer parts measurement on coordinate measuring machines. During the modeling, the wheel <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors</b> are determined by the eccentricity and radius deviation of the pin tooth centers circle, and the deviation between the pin tooth axes positions and the centers circle. The satellite <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors</b> are determined by the satellite eccentricity deviation and the satellite rim eccentricity. Due to the collinearity, the pin tooth and pin tooth hole diameter errors and the satellite tooth profile errors for a designated contact point are integrated into one deviation. Software implementation of the model makes it possible to estimate the pointed errors influence on satellite rotation angle error and reasonable selection of accuracy parameters for technological processes related to reducer parts manufacture. Additionally, it gives the possibility for estimation of the reducer kinematic error according to measurements by means of a coordinate measuring machine and diagnostics of reducer parts <b>manufacturing</b> <b>errors</b> by means of its kinematogram analysis. The model is implemented as a program developed in Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 0 environment. Obtained results have found their application in CAD of cycloid reducers...|$|R
