25|$|The German {{concept of}} {{emergency}} towing prescribes a <b>maximum</b> <b>response</b> time of two hours for any incident in German coastal waters.

Moreover, it is mandatory to have one vessel with 200 t of bollard pull and 100 t each in the North Sea and Baltic respectively. Both ship types are also required to be able to operate under hazardous conditions such as explosive areas and gas leaks.|$|E
500|$|A non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{is a type}} of insurmountable antagonist {{that may}} act in one of two ways: by binding to the active site of the receptor or by binding to an allosteric site of the receptor; in the latter case, the antagonist is called an allosteric antagonist. [...] While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena, they are both called [...] "non-competitive" [...] because the end-results of each are functionally very similar. Unlike competitive antagonists, which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response, non-competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the <b>maximum</b> <b>response</b> that can be attained by any amount of agonist. This property earns them the name [...] "non-competitive" [...] because their effects cannot be negated, no matter how much agonist is present. [...] In functional assays of non-competitive antagonists, depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves, and in some cases, rightward shifts, is produced. The rightward shift will occur {{as a result of a}} receptor reserve (also known as spare receptors) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPrimates {{can learn}} to {{recognize}} a virtually limitless number of visual objects. A candidate neural substrate for this adult plasticity is the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Using a large stimulus set, we explored the impact that long-term experience has on the response properties of two classes of neurons in ITC: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) cells and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells. We found that experience increased <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in ITC...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The use of L-arginine and {{potassium}} chloride separately as supplements {{has been reported}} to result in altered vascular reactivity. The concentration of either agent used has varied widely and there has been no report on the outcome of combined supplementation with both agents on vascular reactivity. We therefore designed this study to measure thoracic aortic ring reactivity after five-week co-supplementation with 1 % L-arginine and 0. 75 % potassium chloride. Methods: Endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortic rings obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats which received the combined supplements were subjected to graded concentrations of carbachol or noradrenaline in organ baths. The <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> (Emax) and the negative logarithm of the concentration producing 50 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> (pD 2) were computed as indices of vasoreactivity.

40|$|Using {{electrophysiological}} techniques, {{we studied}} interactions of dopamine and selected dopaminergic drugs with serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes by RNAs transcribed from cloned cDNAs. Oocytes showing strong expression of 5 -HT 1 c and 5 -HT 2 receptors became weakly {{responsive to the}} neurotransmitter dopamine, which, like 5 -HT, elicited Cl- currents through activation of the phosphatidylinositol/Ca 2 + messenger pathway. The two types of 5 -HT receptors showed similar sensitivity to dopamine; threshold responses were activated at concentrations as low as 1 microM. However, <b>maximum</b> dopamine <b>responses</b> were only 5 - 20 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> activated by 5 -HT. The dopamine D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 was a potent agonist on 5 -HT 1 c and 5 -HT 2 receptors. SCH 23390 elicited currents at concentrations as low as 1 nM, but <b>maximum</b> <b>responses</b> were again only 5 - 20 % of those activated by 5 -HT. Fenoldopam, a dopamine D 1 receptor agonist, also interacted with 5 -HT 1 c and 5 -HT 2 receptors, eliciting threshold responses between 10 and 20 nM. Our experiments raise the possibility that low micromolar concentrations of dopamine can cause weak activation and concomitant desensitization of serotoninergic systems in vivo and demonstrate that benzazepines can interact with 5 -HT receptors at nanomolar concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Mistuning in bladed disks usually {{increases}} the forced <b>response</b> of the <b>maximum</b> responding blade leading to shortened component life in turbine engines. This paper investigates mistuning using a transfer function approach where the frequency response functions (FRFs) are described by natural frequencies and antiresonant frequencies. Using this approach, antiresonant frequencies are {{shown to be}} a critical factor in determining the <b>maximum</b> blade <b>response.</b> Two insights are gained by formulating antiresonant frequencies as the eigenvalues of reduced system matrices: 1) Mistuning a particular blade has no effect on that blade's antiresonant frequencies. 2) Engine orders N and N/ 2, where N is the number of blades on the disk, tend to produce the highest <b>maximum</b> local <b>response.</b> Numerical examples are given using a spring-mass-oscillator model of a bladed disk. Pole-zero loci of mistuned bladed disks show that increased <b>maximum</b> blade <b>response</b> is often due to the damping of antiresonant frequencies. An important conclusion is that antiresonant frequencies can be arranged such that a mistuned bladed disk has a lower <b>maximum</b> blade <b>response</b> than a tuned bladed disk...|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} a drug to have an effect, it needs to bind to its target, and then to affect the {{function}} of this target. The target of a drug is {{commonly referred to as}} a receptor, but can in general be any chemically sensitive site on any molecule found in the body. The nature of such binding can be quantified by characterising how tightly these molecules, the drug and its receptor, interact: this is known as the affinity. Efficacy, on the other hand, {{is a measure of the}} action of a drug once binding has occurred. The <b>maximum</b> <b>response,</b> , will be reduced if efficacy is sufficiently low, but any efficacy greater than 20 or so gives essentially the same <b>maximum</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
