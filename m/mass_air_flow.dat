40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{pollutant}} emissions legislation requirements, spark-ignited engines equipped by a three-way catalyst require a precise control of the Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) fed to the combustion chamber. The AFR control is necessary to assure a stoichiometric mixture for the proper working of the catalyst. In order to guarantee the stoichiometric AFR during transient as well a dedicated Open Loop AFR Control has been implemented. For calculation of the fuel mass to be injected the correct instantaneous <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> is necessary.

A new approach to build the models is introduced in detail. This approach considers two distinct models: for simulation purposes, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> is determined for a given working pressure and command input; for control purposes, the command input is determined given the working pressure and the desired <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> This approach {{enables the use of}} <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> as the synthesized control action, thus rendering the overall pneumatic system affine.

50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the <b>mass</b> of <b>air</b> <b>flowing</b> into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the <b>mass</b> of <b>air</b> <b>flowing</b> past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|R

Two standard methods of estimating air-to-cylinder are investigated. A new nonlinear air-to-cylinder observer is suggested with two states: one for intake manifold pressure {{and one for the}} offset in in-cylinder <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> compared to expected through the volumetric efficiency.

50|$|An {{air flow}} meter, is {{a device that}} {{measures}} air flow, i.e. how much air is flowing through a tube.

5000|$|Most modern engines {{use some}} type of fuel {{injection}} to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based {{on a number of}} sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel/too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen/too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The throttle position sensors tell the ECU how far the throttle plate is opened when you press the accelerator.

5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor) was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a <b>Mass</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> system. This system uses a <b>Mass</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The 5.8 L, 351W, {{was changed}} during the '90s from speed density to MAF; {{performance}} gains were directly affected. Before 1994, the 5.8 L {{was equipped with}} speed density. This programmed coding was placed into the vehicle's computer to tell the motor how much air it should be getting, therefore supplying an appropriate amount of fuel. However, if modifications are made to increase air flow, the computer does not provide more fuel, as it is still following the programmed amount of fuel supplied. After 1994, the engine was changed to <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> (MAF). This allowed the computer to read how much air the engine was receiving through {{the help of a}} sensor in the air intake. Because the computer reads this, it is able {{to increase the amount of}} fuel the engine gets when the air flow is increased, thus increasing performance. Without the MAF conversion, the performance of a nonstock to heavily modified 5.8 L, fuel-injected engine will be lacking.|$|E
