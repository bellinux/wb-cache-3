In 2015, Joe Pring from WhatCulture ranked her as the 31st-greatest female fighting game character of all time.

500|$|The bomb {{exploded}} at 10:27am, causing extensive {{damage to buildings}} along a significant stretch of Bishopsgate. The blast raised a mushroom cloud {{that could be seen}} across much of London and gouged a 15-foot wide crater in the street. Buildings up to 500 metres away were damaged, with 1,500,000 sq ft (140,000 m²) of office space being affected and over 500 tonnes of glass broken. The NatWest Tower — at the time the City's tallest skyscraper – was amongst the structures badly damaged, with many windows {{on the east side of}} the tower destroyed; the Daily Mail said [...] "black gaps punched its fifty-two floors like a <b>mouth</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> bad teeth". Damage extended as far north as Liverpool Street station and south beyond Threadneedle Street. St Ethelburga's church, seven metres away from the bomb, collapsed as a result of the explosion. The cost of repair was estimated at the time at £1 billion. Civilian casualties were low as it was a Saturday morning and the City was typically occupied by only a small number of residents, office workers, security guards, builders, and maintenance staff. Forty-four people were injured by the bomb and News of the World photographer Ed Henty was killed after ignoring police warnings and rushing to the scene. The truck-bomb produced the explosive power of 1,200kg of TNT.|$|E
