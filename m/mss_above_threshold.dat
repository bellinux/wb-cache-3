40|$|A {{well-known}} {{stochastic model}} for intermittent fluctuations in physical systems is investigated. The model {{is given by}} a super-position of uncorrelated exponential pulses, {{and the degree of}} pulse overlap is interpreted as an intermittency parameter. Expressions for excess time statistics, that is, the rate of level crossings <b>above</b> a given <b>threshold</b> and the average time spent <b>above</b> the <b>threshold,</b> are derived from the joint distribution of the process and its derivative. Limits of both high and low intermittency are investigated and compared to previously known results. In the case of a strongly intermittent process, the distribution of times spent <b>above</b> <b>threshold</b> is obtained analytically. This expression is verified numerically, and the distribution of times <b>above</b> <b>threshold</b> is explored for other intermittency regimes. The numerical results compare favorably to known results for the distribution of times <b>above</b> the mean <b>threshold</b> for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
