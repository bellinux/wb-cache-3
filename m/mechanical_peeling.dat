There are three methods of peeling fruits and vegetables including mechanical, chemical and thermal, depending on the class and type of fruit. By comparison, the mechanical methods are the most preferred; <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> methods do not create any harmful effects on the tissue and they keep edible portions of produce fresh. The main disadvantage of <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> is the rate of material loss and deformations.

In order to enhance the effectiveness of food industrial practices it is essential to have a clear understanding of material properties and behaviour of tissues under industrial processes. This paper presents the scheme of research that seeks to examine tissue damage of tough skinned vegetables under <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> process by developing a novel FE model of the process using explicit dynamic finite element analysis approach. A computer model of <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> process will be developed in this study to stimulate the energy consumption and stress strain interactions of cutter and tissue.

Improving the knowledge of interactions and involves variables in food operation particularly in peeling process is the main objectives of the proposed study.

Improvement of current <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> methods {{and development of}} new mechanical methods for tough-skinned vegetables which {{are close to the}} "ideal" peeling conditions using mechanical properties of the product were the main objectives of this research. This research has developed four innovative <b>mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> methods {{on the basis of the}} mechanical properties of tough-skinned vegetables. For the first time, an abrasive-cutter brush has been introduced as the best peeling method of tough-skinned vegetables. This device simultaneously applies abrasive and cutting forces to remove the peel. The same peeling efficiency at concave and convex areas in addition to high productivity are the main advantages of the developed method. The developed peeling method is environmentally friendly, as it minimises water consumption and peeling wastes. The peeling process using this method has been simulated in a mathematical model and the significant influencing parameters have been determined. The parameters are related to either the product or peeler. Those parameters appeared as the coefficients of a linear regression model. The coefficients have been determined for Jap and Jarrahdale as two varieties of pumpkin. The mathematical model has been verified by experimental results. The successful implementation of this research has provided essential information for the design and manufacture of a commercial peeler for tough-skinned vegetables.

This research was driven by the capability of the Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) manufacturing process to create smart metal matrix composites for use within high value engineering sectors, such as aerospace. The UC process is a hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing process that embeds fibres into metal matrices via the exploitation of a high plastic flow, low temperature phenomenon encountered at ultrasonic frequency mechanical vibrations. The research concerned {{an investigation of the}} use of the UC process for embedding Nickel-Titanium alloy (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) fibres into Aluminium (Al) matrices which could potentially be used as vibration damping structures, stress state variable structures, as well as other future smart material applications. It was hypothesised that the fibre volume fraction within a UC matrix was limited due to a reduction in foil/foil bonding, caused by increased fibre numbers, as opposed to the total level of plastic flow of the matrix material being insufficient to accommodate the increased fibre numbers. This hypothesis was tested by increasing the NiTi SMA fibre volume fraction, within an Al 3003 (T 0) metal matrix, beyond that of previous UC work. The metal matrix and the fibre matrix interface of these samples was then microscopically analysed and the overall UC sample integrity was tested via <b>mechanical</b> <b>peel</b> testing.

The mechanical changes in the stems were measured on a weekly basis, by carrying out a series of <b>mechanical</b> <b>peel</b> and tear tests on the stem tissue of mature plants. There was a pronounced drop in the moisture content of the stem 14 days after application of the herbicide, from a moisture content of ~ 60 to 10 %. This was consistent with the onset of senescence and subsequent dehydration of the plant tissues. The dehydration of the stem tissues corresponded with an increase in the work required to peel the fibre bundles from the secondary phloem tissue, from 212 ± 7. 9 to 539 ± 22 J m− 2 (P< 0. 001). However, 27 days after application of the herbicide there was a more gradual but significant drop in the work required to peel the stem, by ~ 45 % to a mean work to peel of 297 ± 19. 8 J m− 2.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{model of}} peeling process {{is required to}} optimise main influenced factors {{as well as to}} limit peeling waste and consumed energy. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>peeling</b> process using an abrasive-cutter brush which applies both abrasive and cutting forces was modeled. Choosing the input and output variables which would be industrially applicable was attempted. Three variables, namely, angular velocities of abrasive-cutter brush (ωp), the degree of unevenness of produce surface (φ), and the shape of the abrasive-cutter brush (λ), were chosen as independent variables and the peel losses per unit time were chosen as the output of the model. The developed model was verified using the experimental results of peeling by abrasive-cutter brush for two varieties of pumpkin named Jarrahdale and Jap. The results showed correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental values of the Jap (0. 98) and Jarrahdale (0. 96) were statistically significant. It is concluded that the relationship among different parameters of the product and peeling tool and their effect on the peeling rate would be industrially applicable. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{investigation}} of the control system failure Inertial Upper Stage on IUS- 1 flight to position a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) in geosynchronous orbit, the materials utilized in the techroll seal are evaluated for possible failure models. Studies undertaken included effect of temperature on the strength of the system, effect of fatigue on the strength of the system, thermogravimetric analysis, thermomechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimeter analysis, dynamic <b>mechanical</b> analysis, and <b>peel</b> test. The most likely failure mode is excessive temperature in the seal. In addition, the seal material is susceptible to fatigue damage which could be a contributing factor...|$|R
40|$|Citrus fruit {{creasing}} or cracking is {{a complex}} pre-harvest physiological disorder that causes significant economic losses. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} citrus fruit creasing or cracking is caused not only by genetic factors but also by environmental factors. By reviewing the relationship between citrus fruit creasing or cracking and <b>peel</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties, the cellular wall ultrastructure, cellular wall metabolism and modification, this paper summarized the mechanism of citrus creasing or cracking and further explained the effects of genetic factors and environmental factors (light, temperature, humidity, mineral nutrition and plant growth regulators) on citrus fruit creasing or cracking rate. Further studies were proposed to provide a sound theoretical basis on citrus fruit creasing or cracking...|$|R
40|$|In this works, a glow {{discharge}} cold plasma treatment {{was employed to}} treat organic and inorganic fibre (aramid, polyethylene and glass fibres) with the aim to improve the fibre-matrix interface properties. In order to quantitatively assess the effect of plasma treatment, treated and untreated fibres were used to fabricate specimens suitable for <b>mechanical</b> test characterisation. <b>Peeling</b> test and three-point bending tests were performed on untreated and treated specimens. Scanning electron microscopy was utilised to examine the plasma effects on the fibres surface and on the specimen fracture surfaces. The results obtained indicate that the interface strength depends of both the fibre type and the treatment time. In all cases, an increase in delamination energy was observed under appropriate treatment conditions. SEM analysis had shoved variation in the fibres roughens Although this last result, the measured Young’s modulus and flexural strength do not undergo any decrease, whichever the exposure tim...|$|R
