40|$|Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), 2006 {{stipulates}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> for repatriation costs (Standard A 2. 5), and contractual compensations {{related to}} death or longterm disability of seafarers {{due to an}} occupational injury, illness or hazard (Standard A 4. 2) {{that is to be}} provided by the shipowner. However, financial security system set in the MLC was prescribed very broadly and insufficiently precise and, therefore, it opened a number of questions and doubts. Among others, the following questions are particularly interesting: what the legal nature of the MLC financial security is; from the insurance standpoint, whether this is life or accident insurance, or it is liability insurance; who has an insurable interest and what the nature of that interest is; which document proves fulfilment of MLC requirements. Due to the necessity of improving financial security provisions, in 2014 Amendments to the MLC were adopted that came into force in January 2017. Although the MLC does not explicitly prescribe a system of compulsory insurance, with the third injured party the right to a direct claim (actio directa) towards the liability insurer, marine insurance given its characteristic, appeared as a very suitable method of fulfilling MLC requirements – especially P&I insurance. All the clubs within the International Group of P&I Clubs have agreed to assist their members (shipowners) in complying with these additional financial security requirements under the Amendments to the MLC and issue MLC Certificates to their members. MLC Certificates refer to the MLC Extension Clause, 2016 and thus subject the insurance to conditions and limitations in the said clause. MLC Extension Clause provisions will be added to clubs P&I Rules which form the standard P&I cover...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Existing {{research}} has shown that elders experience changes in their life satisfaction following stressful life events. There is an abundance of literature supporting the predictive nature of not only stressful life events on life satisfaction, but social support, autonomy, and <b>financial</b> <b>security.</b> What the literature is lacking, is examination of the buffering effect of social support, autonomy, and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> on the relationship between stressful life events and life satisfaction. This study hypothesizes that increases in social support, autonomy, and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> will buffer the impact of SLEs for elders and thus, they will experience increases in their life satisfaction over time. It is also expected that social support and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> will buffer differently among Black and White elders. Methods: The public use files of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) between the years 2006 and 2012 are used to explore the interaction between social support, autonomy, and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> with stressful life events and the impact on life satisfaction. Linear regression are conducted to explore each buffering impact on life satisfaction over time. Results: The research findings in this dissertation demonstrate that the changes in personal resources; social support, autonomy, and financial security; {{play an important role in}} changes in life satisfaction. Additionally, Black and White elders are impacted differently by changes in <b>financial</b> <b>security.</b> In general, the results from this study demonstrate that individuals who have declines in their personal resources following stressful life events also experience declines in their life satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the great Recession, there is new urgency in America to address a {{pressing}} need for greater household <b>financial</b> <b>security.</b> From 2007 to 2010, Americans' median net worth fell 38. 8 %, and mean net worth fell 14. 7 %. Americans currently face a $ 6. 6 trillion retirement savings deficit. A bipartisan consensus is within political reach on the need to rebuild household balance sheets with policies that expand private savings and thus enhance middle-class opportunity and security. The decline in wealth from the housing and financial crises, the stagnation in wages, and the inadequacy of retirement savings attract new interest from industry leaders, advocates, and policy leaders on both the left and right. The urgency to enact policies now that improve <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> does not just apply to lower-income americans; these are policies that have the potential to impact most americans. Smart savings policies belong in a pro-growth agenda and can be pursued through modest investments or targeted reforms that policymakers should champion and implement. This report presents the findings from the 2012 Aspen Institute <b>Financial</b> <b>Security</b> Summit. An exclusive gathering of top business leaders, experts, advocates, and media. The summit advanced the dialogue on the public and private solutions that build more savings and wealth in American households, strengthen middle-class opportunity, and improve the economic future of the country. In an election year with a budgetary showdown looming, the Aspen Institute Initiative on <b>Financial</b> <b>security</b> (Aspen IFs) chose to host its first <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> summit in Aspen, Colorado to bring thoughtful leaders together to wrestle with the contours of a new strong and politically feasible <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> vision. With the American economy at crossroads, summit participants revealed compelling consensus around savings policies that have the power to enhance economic mobility and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> while directing Americans away from a culture of unaffordable consumption. From acclaimed civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young and activists such as Marc Morial to leading conservative scholars such as Douglas Holtz-Eakin and prominent independents such as David Walker, the headlines emerge: <b>Financial</b> <b>security</b> is the key to America's promise to its middle class, and achieving a much greater measure of <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> is a goal that financial industry leaders and consumer advocates believe in and can advance...|$|R

We explicitly model accounting discretion and earnings management in a disclosure setting motivated by Shin (1994). We use this setting to study the interaction between management’s voluntary disclosure and the subsequent mandatory disclosure of value-relevant information. We show that, in equilibrium, allowing the manager to have some discretion over the <b>mandatory</b> <b>financial</b> reports may enhance the informativeness of the more-timely voluntary disclosure. However, allowing too much discretion for earnings management may result in less informative voluntary disclosure.
