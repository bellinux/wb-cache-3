5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, {{they could never}} compete with {{low-cost}} developing countries such as China or India.

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} {{to the idea that}} humans may face extinction due to environmental degradation, paleontologist David Jablonsky counters by arguing that humans are a weed species. Like other weedy species, humans are widely dispersed {{in a wide variety of}} environments, and are highly unlikely to go extinct no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> damage the environment faces.|$|E

25|$|Americans are {{increasingly}} aware that structural and systemic problems – lack of electronic medical records, computerized physician orders, and coordination among various clinicians {{and health care}} systems – mean these problems affect {{the rich and the}} poor alike, that people cannot really buy their way out of unsafe and unreliable care no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money they have.|$|E

Polk remains the only president who also served as Speaker of the House.|$|E
25|$|The {{complaint}} of psi investigators for {{years had been}} {{that they did not}} have enough funding for their experiments. However, in Randi's opinion it was not funding but the experimenters that were the problem. With $500,000 from McDonnell, Randi felt that lack of funding could no longer be blamed for any failure. Randi's purpose was to show that no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money was spent, there would still be no reliable results.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me that no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was {{a perfect example of}} that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} points made by dam expansion opponents is that raising the dam will not create more water (in fact it will actually cause some water loss due to evaporation) but merely increases the capacity to store it. As a result, the reservoir will rarely be filled, as no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Reclamation expands the dam, the river's flow will not increase. The cost of the dam raise is projected at $500 million-$1 billion. One of the expansion's most staunch opponents is the Winnemem Wintu tribe, almost all of whose land was inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. Raising the dam would destroy much of their little remaining land.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E
25|$|Rett is Deshwitat's {{best friend}} and {{fighting}} partner, both {{in the past and}} in the present. Rett led a party of men to attempt to stop Kalutika's rebirth into a God, but arrived too late. Because of their past friendship, Kalutika forced immortality on him so that Rett would have to witness the end of the world. Rett is a good natured and rowdy man who enjoys beer, women, and good living. He is often able to read Deshwitat's true feelings, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the vampire tries to conceal them. He is quite lecherous, particularly to Millenear, Remy and Beryun. He was also in love with Master Tae in her youth, but did not pursue the relationship because he would have to see her grow old and die. Some refer to him as 'Hellrasier'.|$|E
60|$|But this wrath against Beatrix did not {{lessen the}} angry {{feelings}} of the Colonel against {{the man who had}} been the occasion if not the cause of the evil. Frank sat down on a stone bench in the court-yard, and fairly fell asleep, while Esmond paced up and down the court, debating what should ensue. What <b>mattered</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> or <b>how</b> little had passed between the Prince and the poor faithless girl? They were arrived in time perhaps to rescue her person, but not her mind; had she not instigated the young Prince to come to her; suborned servants, dismissed others, so that she might communicate with him? The treacherous heart within her had surrendered, though the place was safe; and it was to win this that he had given a life's struggle and devotion; this, that she was ready to give away for the bribe of a coronet or a wink of the Prince's eye.|$|R

25|$|All {{members of}} the Komsomol were obligated to join the League, and it {{directed}} all {{members of the}} CPSU to support the League's work. The extreme character of the line to be taken against religion is described: All religions, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they 'renovate' and cleanse themselves, are systems of idea... profoundly hostile to the ideology of... socialism... Religious organizations... are in reality political agencies... of class groupings hostile to the proletariat inside the country and of the international bourgeoisie... Special attention must be paid to the renovationist currents in Orthodoxy, Islam, Lamaism and other religions... These currents are but the disguises for more effective struggle against the Soviet power. By comparing ancient Buddhism, and ancient Christianity to communism, the Renovationists are essentially trying to replace the communist theory by a cleansed form of religion, which therefore becomes more dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> trouble she causes.|$|E

50|$|The {{chasuble}} took Mabel {{about two}} years to finish. As she was finishing her work in 1241, pearls and gold were ordered for her use in decorating the robe.
