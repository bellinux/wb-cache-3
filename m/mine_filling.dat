40|$|For {{minimizing}} surface subsidence, {{river sand}} is mostly used in abandoned coal mines filling. Due {{to increase in}} the use of the river sand in the construction industries, the mining industries are facing scarcity of river sand to fill abandoned mine. After extraction of coal from mines, large number of coal mines leave without filling, which creates surface subsidence. Therefore, the mining industry is searching for an alternate filling material which is easily available in large quantity and in minimal cost. The present work aims to characterize and utilize the largely available coal ashes in abandoned <b>mine</b> <b>filling</b> applications and to study the various issues related to geo- environmental aspects of the same. From the experimental results, it is concluded that coal ashes can replace the conventional river sand normally used for <b>mine</b> <b>filling</b> applications and thereby cost of the project as well as the environmental problems relating to coal ash can be reduced to a significant extent. It was observed that the water holding capacity of bottom ash considerably lower than pond and fly ashes. XRD results show that coal ash has more numbers of quartz, mullite and iron oxide peaks. The coal ash used in this study is classified under Class ‘F’ according to ASTM C 618. However, in general Class ‘F’ fly ash can provide a better filler material than Class ‘C’ fly ash, because the calcium content is low. Heavy metal concentrations were leached more from fly ash as compared to bottom ash and pond ash. Initially, when neutral coal ash is mixed with acidic water, the pH value increases and after 24 hours it gradually decreases and attains value confirming to drinking water standard...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Coal Combustion Byproducts (CCBs) are {{attractive}} for filling abandoned coal mines {{because they may}} constitute a source of low cost alkalinity and favorable economics. The environmental risk of <b>mine</b> <b>filling</b> with CCBs is currently evaluated by either the Toxic Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) or the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP). However, these tests include only one leach cycle and there is doubt regarding their applicability to long-term CCBs leaching behavior in groundwater environments: particularly those associated with coal mines. The Mine Water Leaching Procedure (MWLP) was developed to provide a site specific risk assessment tool. In this study we added increasing proportions of coal mine spoil to MWLP fly ash leachings to evaluate the potential of a given mine spoil to sorb selenium ions. Selenium {{has emerged as a}} significant mine drainage issue associated with placement of coal ash in exhausted coal pits in the eastern U. S. coal fields. This study indicated that significant attenuation may be realized by selectively placing selenium source materials upgradient of fine grained mine spoils. To evaluate th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzed}} {{the feasibility of}} tailings briquetting for filling mining subsidence area based on the actual conditions. In the experiment, the diameter 25 mm filling balls were made of slurry of Jinshandian tailings and cement, the cement tailing ratio was 1 : 4, the concentration of slurry was respectively 68 %, 70 %, 72 %, 75 %, and the falling strength, the compressive strength, the powder ratio about the filling balls were tested. The {{results showed that the}} falling strength was more than 50 times/A; the compressive strength was 5. 23 ~ 21. 12 MPa; the powder ratio was 0. 69 %~ 10. 52 %. The results of the PFC 2 D numerical simulation showed that the maximum stress among the filling balls was 3. 39 MPa during the ore drawing process. The stress was lower than the minimum compressive strength of 5. 23 MPa, and the corresponding powder ratio was less than 8 %. It has been concluded that the filling-body is able to meet the requirement of the strength and the powder ratio in the <b>mine</b> <b>filling.</b> The filling-body can be applied to backfilling subsidence area...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{increase}} in generation of ash products from coal-based thermal power plants have rendered these materials {{as an alternative}} to natural mineral resources in the field of geotechnical engineering. Fly ash and bottom ash are the two major ash materials produced from coal-based thermal power plants. When fly ash and bottom ash are mixed together and transported in the form of slurry and stored in lagoons, the deposit is termed as pond ash. Utilization of ash materials for various applications (reclamation, <b>mine</b> <b>filling,</b> retaining wall back fill material, and in pavements as a sub-base material, etc.) can alleviate disposal problems. When ash materials are used as a construction material and subjected to dynamic loading due to earthquakes, machine foundations, explosions, traffic movements, etc., it is important to obtain the dynamic properties shear modulus and damping ratio–at wide range of shear strains. The present study focuses on studying the behavior of bottom ash, fly ash, and pond ash subjected to cyclic loading using cyclic simple shear testing. In addition, the dynamic properties of ash materials are compared with Indian Standard (I. S.) sand. Dry sand and bottom ash specimens of 70 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height are prepared at relative densities equal to 30 %, 50 % and 75 % and tested at a shear strain of 0. 01 % to 1 % under vertical stresses equal to 100 kPa, 200 kPa, and 400 kPa...|$|E
40|$|During this quarter, the {{majority}} of activity focused on grout emplacement at the Lodestar Energy Inc. (formerly Costain Coal Co.) surface mine auger holes described in the previous report. Specifically, {{two different types of}} grout pumps were investigated: a piston pump used in previous demonstrations, and a progressive cavity pump. The latter is currently utilized for grouting in underground coal mines, is relatively small and portable, and is capable of receiving dry material (e. g., fly ash) and water, mixing it to produce a grout, and pumping the grout at high pressure. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate it`s potential use in auger <b>mine</b> <b>filling.</b> Several field demonstrations were conducted using the different pumps. Numerous problems were encountered when using the progressive cavity pump, all of which were related to its inability to handle the highly reactive and heterogeneous FBC fly ash. Even relatively small ash agglomerates (< 1 in. in diameter), which were not a problem for the larger piston pump, caused blockages in the progressive cavity pump which not only proved extremely difficult to clear, but also resulted in significant mechanical failures. Furthermore, mixing of dry fly ash with water within the progressive cavity pump was inconsistent and difficult to control. Consequently, the pump was unable to completely fill even a single auger hole. It was found that a large proportion of bed ash in the grout generated a large amount of heat and caused early stiffening of the material. During the experiments, cylinders of grout were prepared for compressive strength testing, and moisture contents were determined on-site. A thermocouple assembly was also constructed to record grout temperatures within an auger hole...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia, and several other countries worldwide. As a result of mining operations, very large underground openings are created that are later backfilled to provide regional stability. The large underground voids that are backfilled are called stopes, and they can be approximated as rectangular prisms, which can be more than 100 m in depth. Backfilling is also seen as an effective means of disposing the by-products of the mineral processing called tailings that are left after the valuable minerals are extracted from the ore. There are several types of <b>mine</b> <b>fills</b> such as hydraulic fills, cemented hydraulic fills, paste fills, aggregate fills, cemented aggregate fills, and rock fills that are based on combinations of surface process tailings, and development waste or quarried rock. Hydraulic fills have often been considered as the conventional <b>mine</b> <b>fill</b> materials, primarily owing to their widespread usage throughout Australia: in Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia...|$|R
