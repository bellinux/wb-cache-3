25|$|The {{introduction}} of portable radio {{systems in the}} early 20th century {{gave rise to the}} possibility of using radio broadcasters (beacons) as a landmark that would be visible to a radio receiver at very great ranges, hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The angle between the navigator and the beacon can be taken by using a simple mechanism known as a loop antenna which can be rotated around the vertical axis. As the antenna is rotated, the strength of the received signal varies, and drops to zero (the null) when the loop is perpendicular to the line to the beacon.|$|E
500|$|During the killings, the 2nd Battalion {{came under}} {{sporadic}} artillery and mortar {{fire from the}} North Koreans, who advanced cautiously from Yongdong. Declassified Army intelligence reports showed that the enemy front line was two <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> from No Gun Ri late on July 28, {{the third day of}} the massacre. That night, the 7th Cavalry messaged division headquarters, [...] "No important contact has been reported by our 2nd Battalion." [...] Unit documents never reported the refugee killings.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, I {{go back and look at}} the pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{next year}} Gardner {{and his cousin}} went to the Platteville Diggings in the Wisconsin Territory {{to work in the}} lead mines there (this being the height of the region's [...] "lead rush"), and built a cabin about a mile north of the village of Platteville, in which they spent the winter of 1827-28. Gardner spent his nights reading by an improvised lamp. When a local [...] "debating society" [...] was formed, Gardner became one of the leaders, and gained quite a {{reputation}} as a disputant. In later years he often said that he [...] "graduated by the side of a mineral hole." [...] In the fall of 1828, he returned to Illinois across the country, traveling 250 <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of wilderness, he would later say, [...] "without seeing a human habitation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Previously, the General Assembly {{passed a}} bill in 2006 to allow {{offshore}} exploratory gas drilling outside a 50-mile limit. On March 11, 2010, McDonnell signed into law bipartisan legislation to allow the drilling {{for oil and gas}} in federal waters 50 <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> off the Virginia coast if also permitted by the Federal government. (see Offshore drilling on the US Atlantic coast). The plan was criticized by some environmentalists and Democrats who argued that tourism and wildlife would be threatened and that oil drilling would not make a difference in achieving long-term energy independence. Congressman James P. Moran (D-Va), chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, [...] and others, argued further that most of the proposed drilling area was located in an area reserved for naval operations.|$|E

2500|$|The total {{distance}} from the first tee box to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages [...] "through the green" [...] can be in excess of , and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel five <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> during a round. At some courses, electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a [...] "golf trolley" [...] for their bag. These trolleys {{may or may not}} be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course. A caddie's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working, and not to other competing players.|$|E
