5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the rear deck.|$|E

The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the foremast at the same time.|$|E
