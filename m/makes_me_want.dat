500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E

The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball.

[...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to curl up in a blanket and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E

Lucas Villa from Axs.com deciphered the themes of the track: [...] "Tougher subjects Utada tackled on Exodus included her dissolving marriage to Kazuaki Kiriya on 'You <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Want</b> to Be a Man.' She turned her frustrations about gender roles in a relationship into a feminist message, singing, 'I really {{want to tell you}} something but I can't / You <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to be a man.' Several critic publications, including Renowned for Sound, #PopHatesFlops, and MuuMuse, quoted similar aspects of her relationship and feminism views as key themes to the song.|$|R

He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in Cinderella at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.|$|E
500|$|Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times called [...] "Scream" [...] {{the best}} {{song on the}} album. He continued, [...] "The refrain of [...] "Stop pressurin' me!" [...] is compelling, and he spits out the lyrics with drama and purpose. The song has bite and {{infectious}} energy." [...] MacDonald did, however, consider the use of profanity unnecessary. Deepika Reddy of The Daily Collegian wrote, [...] "The lyrics to the album's debut single and video 'Scream' are {{for the first time}} in Jackson's convoluted career, painfully direct. He sings 'Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to scream' with a force and resentment that's new and surpassing." [...] "'Scream' and 'Tabloid Junkie' have a raw aspect that Jackson hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean.'" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post, however, called it [...] "dull and musically uninvolved." [...] He was also of the opinion that it sounded like [...] "Jam" [...] from 1991, thus dated.

Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to throw up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance." [...] said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.|$|E

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're {{going to see a}} new side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When he makes me weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When he <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E

Beck felt that [...] "Loser" [...] was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. [...] "Loser" [...] unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU was the first to play it, and later on Santa Monica College radio station KCRW, where radio host Chris Douridas played the song on Morning Becomes Eclectic, the station's flagship music program. [...] "I called the record label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air," [...] Douridas said. [...] "He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of 'Loser' and did his song 'MTV <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Want</b> to Smoke Crack.'" [...] That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. As Bong Load struggled to press more copies of [...] "Loser", Beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels.
