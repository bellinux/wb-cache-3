Laboratory soil block decay testing using the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was performed and weight loss calculated. Results show that epichlorohydrin modified specimens did not lower the EMC significantly, yet there was biological effectiveness at 31 % weight gain for the solid wood and 60 % weight gain for the fiber.

40|$|Abstract: The Conversion from desktop {{applications}} to web or remote applications makes website {{development as a}} growing area of software industry. During the analysis phase of web application development web model of the web application is created. This web model represents all {{the components of the}} web application that are to be tested. After generating the web model the very next step that is taken for testing the web application is to generate test cases. Web testing deals with this issue and during this testing we generate test cases. This testing is followed up by regression testing if we bring any feasible change in the web model. The regression testing verify whether previous model functionality will regress or fail by marking which previous test cases are valid or discarded in the updated model [12]. The updated web model is then used to generate the new test cases. Each and every time when we added a new module in the existing model then we have to check the effect of test cases generated earlier for existing modules because the new module added to the system may interact with the existing modules. In this paper we proposed an automatic {{way to deal with the}} <b>modification</b> <b>part</b> of the test cases existing for the already mentioned modules in the web model...|$|E

The article explores the modification puzzle and the issues of erratic justice that result from the nebulous nature of the UCC test, and evaluates an alternative test (the sequential approach) that scrutinizes each step of the modification process and imports the standard of reasonable grounds into this context. Part II discusses terminology and fundamental concepts in this area of law, including the reasons for seeking a modification, the steps of a modification, and the typical defense to an action to enforce a <b>modification.</b> <b>Part</b> III considers the social utility of contract modifications.

40|$|The {{world economy}} is {{experiencing}} a technological revolution, fueled by rapid advances in microelectronics, optics, and computer science, that in the 1990 s and beyond will dramatically change the way people everywhere communicate, learn, and access information and entertainment. This technological revolution has been underway for about a decade. The emergence of a fully-interactive communications network, {{sometimes referred to as}} the 2 Ì 2 Information Superhighway, 2 Ì 2 is now upon us. This highway, made possible by fiber optics and the convergence of several different technologies, is capable of delivering a plethora of new interactive entertainment, informational, and instructional services that are powerful and user-friendly. The transition from analog to digital technologies, the expanding bandwidth of the enabling platform, and the shift from regulated to competitive environments have all served to make the 1990 s the decade in which the Information Superhighway will be built and used. A true revolution in the delivery of entertainment, information, transactions, and telecommunications services is at hand. This paper outlines these technological changes and explores their implications for competition policy, industry structure, and business organization. Part I introduces competition as an organizational model and discusses the existing structure of the telecommunications industry in the United States. Part II describes recent technological advances that change the conditions underlying the current regulatory structure of the telecommunications industry and challenges the effectiveness and validity of the current regulatory scheme. Part III discusses how innovation impacts what has been considered the natural monopoly of local exchange.

40|$|Today we are {{experiencing}} an "eco friendly boom"; {{which includes the}} developing of ecological processes that have a smaller impact in the environment. This {{is the reason that}} prompted me to carrying out this thesis; the aim is to use a vegetable extract as a sustainable product for the pre-tanning processes. This study considers the use of the fruit of the Tara tree as a raw material source of tannins with low carbon footprint and proposes alternatives to avoid or reduce the use of commercial vegetable extracts, synthetic products and mineral salts that require non sustainable processes. Various experimental designs have been developed as to obtain new tailored Tara tannins by both chemical and physical modification, in order to obtain a higher percentage of tannins, and therefore improve its tanning capability, also reducing the astringency and improving the penetration of the tannin molecules through the leather structure. In chemical modifications, several aqueous extractions at different temperatures and combined with some chemicals, have been developed and optimized in order to increase the tannin content and reduce the astringency. The degree of hydrolysis has controlled by measuring the Gallic acid content by means of HPLC (High performance liquid Chromatography). In the physical <b>modification</b> <b>part,</b> the Tara has been milled and sieved, at several particle sizes, with the aim of obtaining a smaller molecular size. Both chemical and physical modifications were tested in hides, in a wet-white pre-tanning process, combining them with the fewest possible commercial vegetable extracts and syntans. The formulations have been optimized by experimental design. All the resulting leather products and final baths have been analyzed with physical and chemical tests respectively, to determine if they comply with the parameters established by the IULTCS (International Union of Leather Technologists and Chemists Societies). Finally, a life cycle assessment has been developed, {{in order to determine the}} environmental improvement of the new modified product, obtained in this thesis. This thesis is also supported with articles published in magazines specialized in the Leather sector. There are two articles published in the Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association (JALCA), named: *Low carbon products for the design of innovative leather processes.
