40|$|Intensive {{cellular}} movements {{occur during}} gastrulation. These cellular movements {{rely heavily on}} dynamic actin assembly. Rho with its associated proteins, including the Rho-activated formin, Diaphanous, are key regulators of actin assembly in cellular protrusion and migration. However, the function of Diaphanous in gastrulation cell movements remains unclear. To study the role of Diaphanous in gastrulation, we isolated a partial zebrafish diaphanous-related formin 2 (zdia 2) clone with its N-terminal regulatory domains. The GTPase binding domain of zDia 2 is highly conserved compared to its mammalian homologues. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we showed that zDia 2 interacts with constitutively-active RhoA and Cdc 42. The zdia 2 mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed during early embryonic development in zebrafish as determined by RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses. Knockdown of zdia 2 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) blocked epiboly formation and convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ectopic expression of a human mdia gene partially rescued these defects. Time-lapse recording further showed that bleb-like cellular processes of blastoderm <b>marginal</b> <b>deep</b> marginal cells and pseudopod-/filopod-like processes of prechordal plate cells and lateral cells were abolished in the zdia 2 morphants. Furthermore, zDia 2 acts cell-autonomously since transplanted zdia 2 -knockdown cells exhibited low protrusive activity with aberrant migration in wild type host embryos. Lastly, co-injection of antisense MOs of zdia 2 and zebrafish profilin I (zpfn 1), but not zebrafish profilin II, resulted in a synergistic inhibition of gastrulatio...|$|E
40|$|Otoliths {{collected}} from the Late Oligocene of the Eger area revealed the presence of 52 teleost taxa from subtropical to warm temperate waters. Two successive faunas, which have only three species in common, are identified: the Kiscell Clay fauna, comprising 30 taxa, and the Eger Formation fauna, comprising 25 taxa. Although both belong to distinct stratigraphic horizons, the differences are entirely due to ecological factors. The Kiscell Clay provided an association of deepwater fishes, quantitatively very rich in otoliths of mesopelagic fishes, while the Eger association reflects a continental shelf fauna, in which three distinct assemblages corresponding to the progressive shallowing of the environment can be distinguished. The Late Oligocene teleost fauna from the Eger area shows a striking resemblance with the one from the Late Oligocene (Zone NP 25) Saint-Etienne d'Orthe Clay in the Aquitaine Basin, SW France. Notwithstanding the geographic distance separating both areas, 12 of the 20 nominal species (60 %) recorded from the Eger area are also known from Saint-Etienne d'Orthe. Species from both the Eger and the Kiscell Formations are found together in the Saint-Etienne-d'Orthe association. This {{can be explained by}} the depositional environment of the Saint-Etienne-d'Orthe Clay (deep neritic to uppermost slope), the depth of which was intermediate between that of the two Hungarian Formations. It confirms that the marked difference between the Kiscell and Eger otolith associations is ecologically conditioned. Another very important conclusion is that the Late Oligocene (nannoplankton Zones NP 24 and 25) ichthyofauna must have been quite homogeneous from the Paratethys to the Eastern Atlantic. In the neritic component of the fauna studied, the ambassids, sillaginids and leiognatids have an exclusively Indo-West-Pacific Recent distribution (except for some recent Mediterranean intruders through the Suez Canal). Among the deeper dwelling neritic taxa and oceanic fishes, 10 genera or families are not represented in the Recent Mediterranean fauna. This proves that in the Late Oligocene, even <b>marginal</b> <b>deep</b> dependences of this basin were inhabited by more typical oceanic faunas than today. All these data fit very well with the paleogeographic reconstruction of the Late Oligocene Mediterranean realm by RÖGL & STEININGER, which postulates a Paratethys without direct link with the North Sea Basin, but with an open connection with an Indo-Pacific-Atlantic seaway across the Mediterranean and a pronounced circum-equatorial current system.

40|$|During the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC), evaporite-dominated {{sequences}} {{formed in}} <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> basins of the Mediterranean Sea. In the marginal basins, {{the onset of}} the MSC is synchronous and a single depositional framework fits all sequences. In contrast, MSC sequences of the western and eastern deep basins appear to comprise a different number of units and differ greatly in thickness. Even though there exist numerous scenarios for deposition in the <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> basins, the link between the two settings is difficult and scenarios are rarely quantitatively supported. We employ a simple box model for the Messinian Mediterranean to examine the causes of (1) spatial variation in thickness and (2) differences in the time of onset of deposition. Model results are compared with actual observations on the MSC sequences. The results show that a large connection between the western and eastern basin is necessary for, and some degree of water column stratification is conducive to, synchronous onset of the MSC in the marginal basins. Moreover, halite deposits in the deep basins are likely to be coeval and have formed in ≈ 60 ka after a (further) restriction of the Atlantic–Mediterranean connection during the MSC, but without a significant sea level drop. A difference in the net salt gain per unit volume caused the different halite deposition rates in the two basins. A scenario with only a simple restriction of the Atlantic–Mediterranean connection during the Late Miocene – without significant changes in the Mediterranean sea level, the fresh water budget, or the size of the Strait of Sicily – is able to explain the synchronous onset of the MSC, the synchronous marginal evaporite formation and the differences in the deep basinal sequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{isolation}} of the Mediterranean leading to the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) {{is thought to be}} the result of the interplay between global sea level oscillations and a gradual tectonic uplift of the connecting seaways between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, in the Gibraltar Arc region. There is no full consensus, however, on whether a kilometric drawdown ever took place and when, or whether it may have occurred in multiple occasions. The main reasons behind these uncertainties are 1) the absence of drillings that cross the entire evaporitic sequence in the deep basins; 2) the lack of a direct correlation between <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> stratigraphy; and 3) the shortage for quantitative, process-based, mechanistic models that aim to account for the vast amount of multidisciplinary observations available on the MSC.

40|$|Coniacian-Santonian limestones from {{north-western}} Sardinia {{and southern}} Apennines (Italy), evidenced {{the dominance of}} foramol lithofacies over chlorozoan-chloralgal ones. The large spreading of the foramol assemblages in tropical/subtropical sedimentary settings {{would be consistent with}} changing in the environmental conditions which developed due to different types of stress in the water mass. The resulting depositional contexts were open-shelves prone to the more opportunistic forms of the foramol assemblages. They were characterized by the diffusion of the rudists that covered, with their detritus, increasingly larger sectors of the shelf without building real reefs. The different nature and organization of the sediment-producer assemblages as well as the abundance of the bioerosion-derived skeletal detritus resulted in sheets of loose bioclastic sediments that covered bottoms lacking protective rims. The large spreading of molluscs (rudists), which became dominant in the whole shelf, coincided with a reduction of the corals. These latter persisted in the <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> sectors of the shelf as subordinated forms. Both the studied examples refer to post-emersive sedimentary contexts. A tectonically-related topography controlled the inception of the carbonate factories which suffered the effects of local induced upwellings and/or hyperproductivity by terrestrial runoff on post-emersive and/or tectonized transgressed substrata. These local controls superimposed on global fluctuating environmental conditions. The resulting major turning points in the stratigraphic record strictly are coincident with major variation in the global scale chemical/phisical parameters of the Hydrosphere/Atmosphere System...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of the phase relation between the forcing and sedimentary expression is yet unquantified, introducing a bias in tuning recurrent facies variations in the sedimentary record to the astronomical forcing. The identification of a phase lag between precession {{and the most recent}} sapropel in the Mediterranean demonstrates that astronomical forcing and its sedimentary expression are not always in phase. Gypsum deposition in Mediterranean marginal basins during the Messinian Salinity Crisis is also forced by precession-driven climate changes. In contrast to sapropel formation, which involves complex interactions of circulation and biogeochemistry, gypsum formation in such basins is primarily controlled by salinity. Using a simple box model to represent the Late Miocene Mediterranean, we examine the phase relation between gypsum deposition and precessional forcing. For a large range of settings model results show a consistent phase lag between the precessional forcing and salinity in the <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> basins of the Mediterranean. On the basis of our quantitative modelling results we propose that in the astronomical tuning of the Messinian gypsum deposits, a phase lag of 3. 3. kyr. ±. 2. 6. kyr should be taken into account for cycles with a duration of 20. kyr. Accordingly, the astronomically tuned ages of the gypsum deposits become, on average, 3. 3. kyr younger. In the anomalously short 14. kyr cycle that follows the onset of the Messinian Salinity Crisis the phase lag is smaller and within range of the other uncertainties of astronomical tuning...|$|R
40|$|Based on 87 Sr/ 86 Sr {{data of the}} Primary Lower Gypsum (PLG) {{deposits}} in the Vena del Gesso basin—a marginal basin of the Mediterranean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis—a correlation between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and precessional forcing has recently been proposed but not yet confirmed. In this study, a box model is set up to represent the Miocene Mediterranean deep basin and a connected marginal basin. Measurements of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in the Vena del Gesso and estimated salinity extrema are used to constrain model results. In an extensive analysis with this model, we assess whether coeval 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and salinity fluctuations could have been forced by precession-driven changes in the fresh water budget. A comprehensive set of the controlling parameters is examined to assess {{the conditions under which}} precession-driven 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations occur and to determine the most likely setting for PLG formation. Model results show that precession-driven 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and salinity fluctuations in marginal basins are produced in settings within a large range of marginal basin sizes, riverine strontium characteristics, amplitudes of precessional fresh water budget variation, and average fresh water budgets of both the <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> basin. PLG deposition most likely occurred when the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was restricted, and the average fresh water budget in the Mediterranean was significantly less negative than at present day.

Three lithofacies units of Oligocene age are recognized within the sequence. The oldest unit consists of poorly-sorted uhgraded isorganized conglomerate, subordinate graded organized conglomerate, and interbedded mudstone and turbidite sandstone beds assigned to the Refugian and Zemorrian Stages. Asecond conglomeratic unit consisting ofZemorrian strata is interpreted to be a channel facies eroded into and emplaced within the underlying Refugian sequence. The two conglomerate-bearing lithofacies grade upward into a fine-grained sandstone and siltstone succession approximately 1, 100 m thick that is interpreted to be an outer-fan (distal) turbidite sequence.

40|$|Cell {{movements}} in Fundulus blastoderms during gastrulation were studied utilizing timelapse cinemicrography and electron microscopy. Time-lapse films reveal that ceils of the enveloping layer undulate and sometimes separate briefly but remain {{together in a}} cohesive layer. During epiboly, the marginal enveloping layer cells move over the periblast as it expands over the yolk sphere. Movement {{occurs as a result}} of ruffled membrane activity of the free borders of the <b>marginal</b> ceils. <b>Deep</b> blastomeres become increasingly active during blastula and gastrula stages. Lobopodia project from the blastomeres in blastulae and adhere to other cells in gastrulae, giving the cells traction for movement. Contact specializations are formed by the lateral adjacent plasma membranes of enveloping layer cells. An apical junction is characterized by an intercellular gap of 60 - 75 A. Below this contact, the plasma membranes are separated by 120 A or more. In mid-gastrulae, cytoplasmic fibrils occur adjacent to some apical junctions, and small desmosomes appear below the apical junction. Septate desmosomes also appear at this time. A junction with an intercellular gap of 60 A occurs between marginal enveloping layer cells and periblast. Contacts between deep blastomeres become numerous in gastrulae and consist of contacts at the crests of surface undulations, short areas of contact in which the plasma membranes are 60 or 120 A apart, and long regions characterized by a 200 -A intercellular gap. Lobopodia contact other blastomeres only in gastrulae. These junctions contain a 200 -A intercellular space. Some deep blastomeres are in contact with the tips of periblast microvilli. The mechanism of epiboly in Fundulus is discussed and reevaluated in terms of these observations. The enveloping layer is adherent to the margin of the periblast and moves over it as a coherent cellular sheet. Periblast epiboly involves a controlled flow of cytoplasm from the thicker periblast into the thinner yolk cytoplasmic layer with which it is continuous.

40|$|The {{stable isotope}} {{geochemistry}} of Miocene sediments from the leeward {{margin of the}} Great Bahama Bank was examined to investigate burial diagenetic processes in periplatform carbonates. Data indicate that, in addition to differences in bulk proportions of neritic and pelagic carbonate along the slope, rhythmic variation in primary carbonate content has controlled patterns of burial diagenesis and associated geochemical signatures {{throughout much of the}} succession examined. The present study focuses on Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1006 and 1007, the most distal of five sites drilled from <b>marginal</b> to <b>deep</b> basin environments during Leg 166. These Miocene sections are characterized by their cyclic appearance, manifest as decimeter- to meter-scale alternations between light-colored ooze/chalk/limestone and dark-colored marl/marlstone. The section at Site 1006 contains a high proportion of pelagic carbonate and is unlithified to a subbottom depth of ~ 675 m. Fluctuations in δ 18 O and δ 13 C values at this site are independent of lithological variation and reflect primary conditions. At Site 1007, located at the toe-of-slope and composed of a mixture of bank-derived and pelagic carbonate, limestones are densely cemented, show little evidence of compaction and have δ 18 O values up to 2 ‰ higher than coeval sediments at Site 1006. Marlstones at Site 1007 are poorly cemented, exhibit an increase in compaction-related features with depth and have lower and more variable δ 18 O values that {{are similar to those of}} coeval sediments at Site 1006. Isotopic and petrographic characteristics of limestone interbeds result from cement precipitation from cold sea water during the first ~ 100 m of burial. Higher proportions of insoluble materials and pelagic carbonate seem to have inhibited diagenetic alteration in adjacent marlstones; in spite of significant compaction and pressure solution during burial, original isotopic compositions appear to be best preserved in these intervals at Site 1007. The documented contrasts in petrographic and isotopic patterns illustrate the role of primary sediment composition in controlling lithification processes in periplatform carbonates and stress the importance of considering such factors when interpreting geochemical data from ancient shelf and slope limestones...|$|R

Adaptively learn representation that is more effective for the task of vehicle color recognition using spatial pyramid deep learning is given by Chuanping Hu et al. [54]. Deep learning is also been used to grade nuclear cataracts [55]. Deep learning is been widely used in medical image processing for segmentation, classification and registration [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61], image denoising [62] and multimodal learning [63]. Deep learning is proved to give robust image representation for single training sample per person in face recognition task [64]. Corey Kereliuk et al. did music content analysis with deep learning [65]. Land use classification [66], scene classification [67] and visual tracking [68] applications work well with deep learning architectures. Impact of deep learning on developmental robotics is explained in [69]. Multi-label image annotation is been achieved using semisupervised deep learning [70]. Financial signal representation is done in [71] using deep neural networks. Pipeline for object detection and segmentation in the context of volumetric image parsing is proposed using <b>marginal</b> space <b>deep</b> learning [72]. Deep learning is also been used in indoor localization that reduces the location error compared with the three existing methods [73]. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a very popular deep learning network is used in almost all the applications since it is believed {{to be one of the}} most appropriate networks for modeling images [74]. CNN are used for image classification [75], pose estimation [76], face recognition [77] and modeling texts [78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84].|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{diversity}} {{exhibited by}} higher plants is essentially {{related to the}} tremendous variation of leaf shape. With few exceptions, leaf primordia are initiated postembryonically at the flanks {{of a group of}} undifferentiated and proliferative cells within the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in characteristic position for the species and in a regular phyllotactic sequence. Auxin is critical for this process, because genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling are required for leaf initiation. Down-regulation of transcription factors (TFs) and cytokinins are also involved in the light-dependent leaf initiation pathway. Furthermore, mechanical stresses in SAM determine the direction of cell division and profoundly influence leaf initiation suggesting a link between physical forces, gene regulatory networks and biochemical gradients. After the leaf is initiated, its further growth depends on cell division and cell expansion. Temporal and spatial regulation of these processes determines the size and the shape of the leaf, as well as the internal structure. A complex array of intrinsic signals, including phytohormones and TFs control the appropriate cell proliferation and differentiation to elaborate the final shape and complexity of the leaf. Here, we highlight the main determinants involved in leaf initiation, epidermal patterning, and elaboration of lamina shape to generate small <b>marginal</b> serrations, more <b>deep</b> lobes or a dissected compound leaf. We also outline recent advances in our knowledge of regulatory networks involved with the unusual pattern of leaf development in epiphyllous plants as well as leaf morphology aberrations, such as galls after pathogenic attacks of pests...|$|R

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate effect of applying different materials on marginal microleakage in posterior composite restoration. Methods: A standard distal box was prepared on 80 human premolar. The gingival floors were 1 millimeter under CEJ. The specimens were divided to four groups. In the first group, 1 millimeter amalgam {{was used as the}} first increment in proximal box on gingival floor, in the second group flow able composite, and in the third group, RMGI were used. Other cavities were filled by condensable composite. In the fourth group (control), all the cavities were filled only by condensable composite. The specimens, after 6 months of storage, were placed under cyclic load (10000 cycle- 80 N- 1 Hz), and then were immersed in 2 % methylene blue for 6 hours. Afterwards, the specimens were sectioned in the middle of restoration. Extension of dye penetration at the cervical margin was examined under a stereo microscope at 25 x magnification and the leakage was evaluated by Fuks degree. The study data were statistically analyzed using the Mann- Whitney U-test (p< 0. 05). Results: Microleakage was observed in all the groups. The third group demonstrated the most leakage and the least was for the first group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups.) p-value = 0. 689) Conclusion: In cavities with gingival floor under CEJ, different filling methods have no effect on marginal sealing...|$|R

40|$|Assemblages {{composed}} {{entirely of}} agglutinated foraminifera {{occur in a}} restricted range of modern environments: where carbonate dissolution is prevalent, e. g., marshes, deep shelves or ocean depths below the carbonate compensation depth. Fossil agglutinated assemblages undoubtedly come from {{a wider range of}} environments than these modern analogues. Natural post-depositional or diagenetic dissolution of carbonate foraminiferal tests in original dead assemblages (ODAs) leads to the formation of residual agglutinated assemblages. Simulating this process experimentally by treating modern ODAs with dilute acid gives rise to acid-treated assemblages (ATAs). This paper provides a synthesis of previous work on 261 samples and provides new data on a further 87 samples. Investigated environments range from marginal marine marshes and estuaries through fjord and shelf seas to deep sea. The pattern of species diversity in ATAs follows the same pattern as that for ODAs and living assemblages: there is a progressive increase in diversity from <b>marginal</b> marine to <b>deep</b> sea. Because agglutinated foraminifera are normally only a small component of ODAs, the ATAs provide a much more reliable guide to species and generic distributions. Although the faunal distribution patterns are well defined in terms of broad environment, it has proved difficult to account for individual distributions using the available data on abiotic environmental factors. In NW European seas, Miliammina is confined to intertidal to shallow subtidal marginal marine environments but elsewhere it is common on deep shelves (e. g., off Antarctica). In summary where evolution can not explain the absence of calcareous taxa, ATAs fill the no-analogue gap and provide baseline data {{that can be used to}} interpret the ecology of fossil agglutinated assemblages...|$|R
40|$|The Ilan Basin of {{northern}} Taiwan forms the western {{limit of the}} Okinawa Trough, where the trough meets the compressional ranges of central Taiwan. Apatite fission-track ages of 1. 2 ± 0. 5 Ma and 3. 5 ± 0. 5 Ma, measured {{north and south of}} the basin, respectively, indicate faster exhumation rates in the Hsüehshan Range to the north (> 1. 6 mm/yr) than in the Backbone Range to the south (0. 7 mm/yr). Reconstructed subsidence rates along the northern basin margin are also faster than in the south (6 – 7 compared with 3 – 5 mm/yr). Global positioning system (GPS) and active seismological data indicate motion of the southern basin margin to the east and southeast. We propose that the Ilan Basin is being formed as a result of extension {{of northern}} Taiwan, largely controlled by a major southeast-dipping fault, modeled at ∼ 30 ° dip, and mapped as a continuation of the Lishan Fault, a major thrust structure in the Central Ranges. Flexural rigidity of the lithosphere under the basin is low, with elastic thickness ∼ 3 km. A southwest-migrating collision between the Luzon Arc and southern China, accompanied by subduction polarity reversal in the Ryukyu Trench, has allowed crustal blocks that were previously held in compression between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates to move trenchward as they reach the northern end of the collision zone. Subduction polarity reversal permits rapid extension and formation of the Ilan Basin and presumably, at least, the western Okinawa Trough, as a direct consequence of arc-continent collision, not because of independent trench rollback forces. This conceptual model suggests that migrating arc-continent collision causes the rapid formation of <b>deep</b> <b>marginal</b> basins that are then filled by detritus from the adjacent orogen, and that these should be common features in the geologic record...|$|R
40|$|How did the Messinian Salinity Crisis end is {{a matter}} of intense debate between two {{opposite}} concepts i. e., the generalised dilution event, the so-called Lago–Mare, followed by the sudden restoration of the marine conditions {{at the base of the}} Zanclean, or the early partial or complete marine refill that would have happened earlier during the upper Messinian. The Chelif Basin of Northwestern Algeria, one of the greatest Messinian marginal basins of the Mediterranean, provides an exceptional opportunity to study in detail how this major paleoenvironmental change occurred through continuous sedimentary records of the Miocene–Pliocene boundary. Five sections representative of both the central and marginal areas of the Chelif basin were analysed in detail for sedimentology, mineralogy, foraminifera and ostracod assemblages, and stable isotope composition of carbonates. The late Messinian deposits exhibit a great lithological variability with predominant clastic deposits (sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, carbonates) with, in some marginal areas, large slided masses of lower Messinian (Tripoli Unit) that settled just before the base of the Zanclean. Most sediments are either azoic or contain microfossils typical of hyposaline conditions sometimes mixed with benthic foraminifera known to be adapted to stressed environments and even to lacustrine conditions. Fewer types of sediment contain assemblages of planktonic foraminifera, including typical Messinian species, which are thought to be reworked. In contrast, diversified communities of benthic and planktonic foraminifera returned suddenly at the base of the Zanclean; the Messinian–Pliocene transition was marked by an abrupt change of the δ 18 O values of carbonates from variable but predominantly negative values characteristic of low salinity conditions in the upper Messinian to higher and more stable values in the Zanclean typifying marine conditions. The southern margin continued, however, to be submitted to large inputs of continental waters. The beginning of the marine inundation was a transitional period with poorly diversified assemblages of planktonic foraminifera and benthic communities tolerant to oxygen deficient bottom conditions; more stable marine conditions with better bottom water ventilation were set up after a lag time which would roughly correspond to a precession cycle. Except for the more marginal areas where conglomerates and erosional features are observed, the restoration of marine conditions occurred, without any significant erosion in the more central areas where the contact is well marked by strong burrowing activity by benthic organisms. This indicates the rapid substitution in the basin of brackish waters by marine waters. Both mixing of these two kinds of waters and permanence of freshwater inputs in the initial stage of the Pliocene transgression may explain why the community of marine planktonic foraminifera, introduced by the inflowing Atlantic waters, hardly survived in such unfavourable ecological conditions in the Mediterranean and reached a normal development later when more stable marine conditions settled. This study and the comparison with other sections from both <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> Mediterranean basins confirm that the Lago–Mare was a widespread dilution event that affected the whole Mediterranean at the end of the Messinian which was abruptly interrupted by the sudden marine inundation at the base of the Zanclean...|$|R
40|$|During ODP Leg 166, the {{recovery}} of cores from a transect of drill sites across the Bahamas margin from <b>marginal</b> to <b>deep</b> basin environments was an essential requirement {{for the study of}} the response of the sedimentary systems to sea-level changes. A detailed biostratigraphy based on planktonic foraminifera was performed on ODP Hole 1006 A for an accurate stratigraphic control. The investigated late middle Miocene-early Pliocene sequence spans the interval from about 12. 5 Ma (Biozone N 12) to approximately 4. 5 Ma (Biozone N 19). Several bioevents calibrated with the time scale of Berggren et al. (1995 a,b) were identified. The ODP Site 1006 benthic oxygen isotope stratigraphy can be correlated to the corresponding deep-water benthic oxygen isotope curve from ODP Site 846 in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (Shackleton et al., 1995. Proc. ODP Sci. Res. 138, 337 - 356), which was orbitally tuned for the entire Pliocene into the latest Miocene at 6. 0 Ma. The approximate stratigraphic match of the isotopic signals from both records between 4. 5 and 6. 0 Ma implies that the paleoceanographic signal from the Bahamas is not simply a record of regional variations but, indeed, represents glacio-eustatic fluctuations. The ODP Site 1006 oxygen and carbon isotope record, based on benthic and planktonic foraminifera, was used to define paleoceanographic changes on the margin, which could be tied to lithostratigraphic events on the Bahamas carbonate platform using seismic sequence stratigraphy. The oxygen isotope values show a general cooling trend from the middle to late Miocene, which was interrupted by a significant trend towards warmer sea-surface temperatures (SST) and associated sea-level rise with decreased ice volume during the latest Miocene. This trend reached a maximum coincident with the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. An abrupt cooling in the early Pliocene then followed the warming which continued into the earliest Pliocene. The late Miocene paleoceanographic evolution along the Bahamas margin can be observed in the ODP Site 1006 delta 13 C values, which support other evidence for the beginning of the closure of the Panama gateway at 8 Ma followed by a reduced intermediate water supply of water from the Pacific into the Caribbean at about 5 Ma. A general correlation of lower sedimentation rates with the major seismic sequence boundaries (SSBs) was observed. Additionally, the SSBs are associated with transitions towards more positive oxygen isotope excursions. This observed correspondence implies that the presence of a SSB, representing a density impedance contrast in the sedimentary sequence, may reflect changes in the character of the deposited sediment during highstands versus those during lowstands. However, not all of the recorded oxygen isotope excursions correspond to SSBs. The absence of a SSB in association with an oxygen isotope excursion indicates that not all oxygen isotope sea-level events impact the carbonate margin to the same extent, or maybe even represent equivalent sea-level fluctuations. Thus, it can be tentatively concluded that SSBs produced on carbonate margins do record sea-level fluctuations but not every sea-level fluctuation is represented by a SSB in the sequence stratigraphic record...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} {{fluctuating}} tectonic stress patterns within or between continental plates directly influence {{the development of}} a given sedimentary basin is a well-established concept in geotectonics. In recent years it has become increasingly understood that notably the phase of relative compressional stress build-up causes dramatic changes in basin configurations, particularly at basin margins. Detailed assessment of the timing and duration of such phases, and characterisation of the concomitant changes in sedimentary facies distribution patterns (or paleoenvironments) is vital for the better understanding of this process and the various possible underlying mechanisms. Conventionally in Mesozoic and Cenozoic basin analysis notably, the study and interpolation of ammonites and/or calcareous microfossils (planktic and benthic foraminifera, calcareous nannoplankton) {{play an important role in}} the generation of chronostratigraphically and paleoenvironmentally significant information. However, these fossil groups are frequently unsuitable for intra-basinal correlations between <b>marginal</b> marine and <b>deeper</b> marine deposits. Meanwhile, notably in hydrocarbon exploration the study and interpretation of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages has become increasingly successful in stratigraphic analysis of Mesozoic and Cenozoic basins throughout the world. Studies on Cenozoic and Recent dinoflagellate cysts published over the last decades stress their sensitivity to environmental changes, and successful application in high resolution stratigraphy (e. g., Wall et aI., 1977; papers in Head and Wrenn, 1992; Brinkhuis, 1992; Versteegh, 1995). Moreover, the organic-walled cyst producing dinoflagellates are primarily associated with neritic environments, causing their consistent occurrence in marginal marine settings. In more offshore settings, the dinoflagellate signal increasingly consists of transported elements, thus allowing detailed correlations along onshore-offshore transects. This thesis therefore concentrates on the assessment of the applicability of this relatively new biostratigraphic tool on the timing and characterisation of periods (inception) of compression. For the purpose of this study compressional phases recognised in two highly contrasting basins were selected, viz. (I) in the Early Cretaceous of the primarily carbonate dominated Dauphinois Basin (SE France), developed in a tectonically passive setting, and (2) in the Oligocene of the mainly siliciclastic-dominated Pindos Foreland Basin (Epirus, NE Greece) which developed in front of the Pindos Thrust. ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} relatively simple computational models {{are used to}} gain insight in the processes and conditions {{that give rise to}} atypical marine sedimentation, i. e. black shales and evaporites, in mediterranean basins. The geometry of a mediterranean basin [...] i. e. landlocked and with connections to the global ocean that are small compared to the basin size [...] makes it particularly sensitive to changes in climate. The interactions of basin geometry, climate and marine sedimentation are investigated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins of the Cretaceous and Miocene, respectively. The mid-Cretaceous proto-North Atlantic basin in the early stage of its opening is of the mediterranean type {{and one of the most}} pronounced sites of black shale formation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2, 94 Ma). Results from an ocean circulation model show that changes in basinal geometry and sea level would affect the circulation and upwelling pattern in the Atlantic. A series of experiments set up to represent pre-OAE, OAE and post-OAE conditions shows that inflow from the Pacific could have brought nutrients to the Atlantic upwelling zones to fuel enhanced primary productivity during OAE 2 and not before and after. More generally, upwelling and circulation during OAE 2 is appropriate for extensive black shale formation in the proto-North Atlantic. The most recent and one of the world's largest salt giants formed in the Late Miocene Mediterranean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC, 5. 97 - 5. 33 Ma). Although studied for 40 years, knowledge of this remarkable event is largely qualitative. A series of box and ocean circulation models is used to gain detailed insight in the main processes and mechanisms involved in the period running up to and in the first two stages of the MSC, test existing hypotheses quantitatively, examine the conditions with which observational data can be reproduced, and build towards a quantitatively supported scenario. Model results show that a simple scenario fits all available data and observational constraints from <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> water settings. In this scenario the progressive closure of the Atlantic-Mediterranean connections pushes the Mediterranean from pre-MSC open ocean conditions to the synchronous onset of gypsum deposition, followed by, at the acme of the crisis, synchronous halite formation with different deposition rates in the two Mediterranean subbasins. To accumulate the observed volume of gypsum and halite during the MSC, an Atlantic-Mediterranean connection must have accomodated two-layer flow, i. e. a gateway of > 10 m, up to stage 2 of the MSC. A blocked outflow scenario is not viable for the whole MSC but may have existed briefly during stage 2 before the connection with the Atlantic was temporarily disrupted and sea level dropped sharply. During the MSC, Sr isotope ratios and salinity vary on a precessional timescale and can be used as a proxy for the Mediterranean water budget. The Late Miocene fresh water deficit is smaller than at present-day due to a considerably higher river discharge. Hence, Sr ratios and salinity in the Mediterranean are more susceptible to precession-driven climate variations. Noteworthy, and important for determining the exact age of MSC deposits, is that peak salinity and Sr values in the Late Miocene Mediterranean are reached a few kyr after, i. e. lag behind, each precession maximu...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructing the {{long-term}} evolution of organic sedimentation {{in the eastern}} Equatorial Atlantic (ODP Leg 159) provides information {{about the history of}} the climate/ocean system, sediment accumulation, and deposition of hydrocarbon-prone rocks. The recovery of a continuous, 1200 m long sequence at ODP Site 959 covering sediments from Albian (?) to the present day (about 120 Ma) makes this position a key location to study these aspects in a tropical oceanic setting. New high resolution carbon and pyrolysis records identify three main periods of enhanced organic carbon accumulation in the eastern tropical Atlantic, i. e. the late Cretaceous, the Eocene-Oligocene, and the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Formation of Upper Cretaceous black shales off West Africa was closely related to the tectonosedimentary evolution of the semi-isolated Deep Ivorian Basin north of the Côte d'Ivoire-Ghana Transform Margin. Their deposition was confined to certain intervals of the last two Cretaceous anoxic events, the early Turonian OAE 2 and the Coniacian-Santonian OAE 3. Organic geochemical characteristics of laminated Coniacian-Santonian shales reveal peak organic carbon concentrations of up to 17 % and kerogen type I/II organic matter, which qualify them as excellent hydrocarbon source rocks, similar to those reported from other <b>marginal</b> and <b>deep</b> sea basins. A middle to late Eocene high productivity period occurred off equatorial West Africa. Porcellanites deposited during that interval show enhanced total organic carbon (TOC) accumulation and a good hydrocarbon potential associated with oil-prone kerogen. Deposition of these TOC-rich beds was likely related to a reversal in the deep-water circulation in the adjacent Sierra Leone Basin. Accordingly, outflow of old deep waters of Southern Ocean origin from the Sierra Leone Basin into the northern Gulf of Guinea favored upwelling of nutrient-enriched waters and simultaneously enhanced the preservation potential of sedimentary organic matter along the West African continental margin. A pronounced cyclicity in the carbon record of Oligocene-lower Miocene diatomite-chalk interbeds indicates orbital forcing of paleoceanographic conditions in the eastern Equatorial Atlantic since the Oligocene-Miocene transition. A similar control may date back to the early Oligocene but has to be confirmed by further studies. Latest Miocene-early Pliocene organic carbon deposition was closely linked to the evolution of the African trade winds, continental upwelling in the eastern Equatorial Atlantic, ocean chemistry and eustatic sea level fluctuations. Reduction in carbonate carbon preservation associated with enhanced carbon dissolution is recorded in the uppermost Miocene (5. 82 - 5. 2 Ma) section and suggests that the latest Miocene carbon record of Site 959 documents the influence of corrosive deep waters which formed in response to the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Furthermore, sea level-related displacement of higher productive areas towards the West African shelf edge is indicated at 5. 65, 5. 6, 5. 55, 5. 2, 4. 8 Ma. In view of humid conditions in tropical Africa and a strong West African monsoonal system around the Miocene-Pliocene transition, the onset of pronounced TOC cycles at about 5. 6 Ma marks the first establishment of upwelling cycles in the northern Gulf of Guinea. An amplification in organic carbon deposition at 3. 3 Ma and 2. 45 Ma links organic sedimentation in the tropical eastern Equatorial Atlantic to the main steps of northern hemisphere glaciation and testifies to the late Pliocene transition from humid to arid conditions in central and western African climate. Aridification of central Africa around 2. 8 Ma is not clearly recorded at Site 959. However, decreased and highly fluctuating carbonate carbon concentrations are observed from 2. 85 Ma on that may relate to enhanced terrigenous (eolian) dilution from Africa...|$|R
