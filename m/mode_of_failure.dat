5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in geomaterials {{have been}} {{observed}} in practice. Different criteria have been proposed to analyse these failures. In particular, Hill's Condition of Stability and diffuse <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> are considered in this paper in a dual framework: continuum mechanics and discrete mechanics. With the assumption of continuous media, experiments have shown that q constant loading paths (q characterizes the second stress invariant. For axisymmetric conditions, q is equal to: q = sigma(1) - sigma(3), where sigma(1) is the axial stress and sigma(3) the lateral stress) can exhibit non-localized failure modes and are analyzed by the second order work criterion. With the assumption of discrete media, grain avalanches are considered, and spatial and temporal correlations between bursts of kinetic energy and peaks of negative values of second order work are demonstrated from discrete computations. It is concluded that the second order work criterion (under its dual form: continuous and discrete) can be a proper tool to analyse diffuse <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in geomaterials...|$|R

50|$|All river banks {{experience}} erosion, but {{failure is}} dependent on the location and the rate at which erosion is occurring.River bank failure may be caused by house placement, water saturation, weight on the river bank, vegetation, and/or tectonic activity. When structures are built too close to the bank of the river, their weight may exceed the weight which the bank can hold and cause slumping, or accelerate slumping that may already be active. Adding to these stresses can be increased saturation caused by irrigation and septics, which reduce the soilâ€™s strength. While deep rooted vegetation can increase the strength of river banks, replacement with grass and shallower rooted vegetation can actually weaken the soil. Presence of lawns and concrete driveways concentrates runoff onto the riverbank, weakening it further. Foundations and structures further increase stress. Although each <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> is clearly defined, investigation into soil types, bank composition, and environment must be clearly defined in order to establish the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> of which multiple types may be present on the same area at different times. Once failure has been classified, steps may be taken in order to prevent further erosion. If tectonic failure is at fault, research into its effects may aid in the understanding of alluvial systems and their responses to different stresses.|$|E
