5|$|Using radio <b>messages</b> Manekshaw {{addressed}} the Pakistani troops three {{times on the}} subject of surrender, assuring them that they would receive honourable treatment from the Indian troops. They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two <b>messages</b> were delivered as replies to the <b>messages</b> from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. These <b>messages</b> from the Pakistani commanders to their troops were to have a devastating effect on their side, subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E
5|$|After Norman's death, Antares {{took over}} as leader and channeled <b>messages</b> from her. Others later began {{channeling}} her, and recordings of her <b>messages</b> were replayed.

In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a gradual spiritual change in humanity.|$|E
50|$|A ProviderConnection object {{represents}} {{a connection to}} a <b>messaging</b> provider. (The next section explains more about <b>messaging</b> providers.) When you send a <b>message</b> via a ProviderConnection object, the <b>message</b> goes to the <b>messaging</b> provider. The <b>messaging</b> provider forwards the <b>message,</b> following the <b>message's</b> routing instructions, until the <b>message</b> gets to the ultimate recipient's <b>messaging</b> provider, which in turn forwards the <b>message</b> to the ultimate recipient.|$|R
40|$|Proposed is {{a method}} for {{constructing}} a <b>message</b> bus. The <b>message</b> bus {{is based on a}} peer-to-peer network structure. Each node is required to deploy a <b>message</b> node, the <b>message</b> node being responsible for subscription and publishing of a <b>message.</b> Among various <b>message</b> nodes, a <b>message</b> can be published and a <b>message</b> can also be subscribed. The <b>message</b> nodes are self-organized, can automatically construct a <b>message</b> bus, and guarantee that the <b>message</b> bus has a relatively high reliability in terms of the bus structure...|$|R

5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six <b>messages</b> {{from other}} ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which was {{the reason why the}} lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these <b>messages</b> were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send <b>messages</b> for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported <b>messages</b> back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver <b>messages</b> during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 to 1992 Raël and his {{movement}} became increasingly global.

Two years later, Africa became another target area in the mission to spread the Raëlian <b>messages.</b>|$|E
30|$|To change consumers’ behavior, {{strategically}} framed <b>messaging</b> is required. Two {{kinds of}} strategies have been suggested; negative <b>message</b> framing versus positive <b>message</b> framing, local <b>message</b> framing versus global <b>message</b> framing. Negative <b>message</b> framing emphasizes loss while the positive <b>message</b> framing stresses on gains (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole 2009; Smith and Petty 1996). Local <b>message</b> framing highlights {{the impact on}} residence region while Global <b>message</b> framing emphasizes {{the impact on the}} world (Grinstein and Riefler 2015; Scannell and Gifford 2013).|$|R
50|$|To send a <b>message</b> using EPKE, {{the sender}} of the <b>message</b> first signs the <b>message</b> {{using their own}} private key, this ensures {{non-repudiation}} of the <b>message.</b> The sender then encrypts their digitally signed <b>message</b> using the receiver's public key thus applying a digital envelope to the <b>message.</b> This step ensures confidentiality during the transmission of the <b>message.</b> The receiver of the <b>message</b> then uses their private key to decrypt the <b>message</b> thus removing the digital envelope and then uses the sender's public key to decrypt the sender's digital signature. At this point, if the <b>message</b> has been unaltered during transmission, the <b>message</b> will be clear to the receiver.|$|R
30|$|Following the {{approach}} in [1], the actual <b>message</b> to be transmitted is called embedded <b>message,</b> while the innocuous-looking <b>message,</b> {{in which the}} other will be enclosed, is the cover <b>message</b> (cover image in case of images). This embedding process creates a new <b>message,</b> called stego <b>message</b> (stego image in case of images), with the same visual and statistical appearance of the cover <b>message</b> but containing the embedded <b>message.</b>|$|R

The message signs also frequently display non-urgent <b>messages</b> to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety <b>messages</b> and smog alerts.|$|E
