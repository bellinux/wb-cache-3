5000|$|Under the {{direction}} of L’Académie française, the Centre Jeanne d'Arc in Orleans {{has been working on}} a re-edition of Jules Quicherat's Procès de Jeanne d'Arc. According to Bouzy, Quicherat's work forms the basis of most modern scholarship on Joan, but has been discovered to contain a number of errors, selective editing, and use of [...] "originals" [...] that were often highly edited or manipulated versions of earlier documents. Relevant to Joan's crossdressing is Jacques Gelu's treatise, one of the theological treatise ordered by Charles VII for her rehabilitation. Quicherat criticized the text as [...] "uninstructive hodgepodge", and, according to him, [...] "made it considerably shorter, taking out parts of the passages where points of religious dogma are discussed." [...] As Bouzy, a member of the Centre working on the project notes, [...] "This text has hardly ever been consulted by historians, although it provides interesting evidence for the way the fifteenth-century church perceived Joan. The text stresses the problem of Joan's cross dressing — this shows that in 1429, even the prelates who supported Charles VII were reluctant to accept a young girl dressed as a man. Apparently, Charles VII decided in favor of Joan only because his confessor, Gérard <b>Machet,</b> was convinced that Joan was the girl whose coming had been announced in a prophecy by Marie Robine, a hermit from Avignon; and even then, Charles required that she be thoroughly examined. Several other treatises that have never been translated (apart from Gerson's tract) are likely to hold surprises for us as well." ...|$|E

40|$|Literacy {{does not}} develop in a vacuum. Reading is taught and learnt within a social context. The school and {{teachers}} are {{a central part of}} this context, Pretorius and <b>Machet</b> (2003). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the strategies to improve reading in an Eastern Cape community. To realise this aim, I first looked for strategies that are currently used by teachers. Then I focussed on additional strategies that could be of use in improving reading levels. This study observed the practices and accessed perceptions of teachers in two primary schools regarding literacy accomplishments in order to come up with relevant strategies to improve reading levels. My study is a qualitative case study focussed on Foundation and Intermediate Phase literacy. The two schools used in this study have different language policies. The one uses English as the language of learning and teaching and the other school uses isiXhosa. The home language of most of the learners in both schools is isiXhosa. I observed and interviewed teachers to get deeper understanding of the problem in the two schools. The Four Resources Model of Freebody and Luke (1990) proved to be a strategy that could be used to support the development of reading from the early years and on into the high school years. This model was found to articulate well with the official school literacy curriculum. In-school reading strategies could be well supplemented by assisting learners to engage with the four roles of Code Breaker, Text Participant, Text User and Text Analyst. In my investigation I found out that there is a problem in our schools in both home and additional language contexts. There is a great need for both in-school and out-of-school strategies to improve the situation. An Asset Mapping strategy revealed the range of existing and potential strategies available to a particular Eastern Cape community to raise reading levels and thereby improve learning...|$|E
40|$|During the 1990 s, many low-income {{countries}} {{were committed to}} the United Nations Education for All (EFA) goals of ensuring universal access to primary education and learners’ completion of all primary grades (Gove & Wetterberg 2011 : 1). Since then some countries, including South Africa, have made impressive strides towards expanded access to schooling. Much of the progress has stemmed from additional inputs such as classrooms, educators, and textbooks and this has created the assumption that with sufficient inputs, learning will naturally flow. However, increases in enrollment rates alone have not always translated into high quality education or even basic learning. Additionally, South Africa’s unique politically burdened history has had profound effects on the education system. Due to its multifarious population and the amalgamation of various sectors, including education, the Department of Basic Education {{was and still is}} faced with the daunting challenge of providing quality education to its diverse citizens. This has resulted in the establishment of multiracial, multilingual, and multicultural schools. The corollary is that schools have become more inclusive. However, the ability of South Africa to educate its learners cannot be measured by access to schooling or enrollment rates alone, but rather by its ability to impart to learners the knowledge and skills necessary to function as literate and numerate members of the broader society. Within the context of EFA several international organisations began to conduct early grade reading assessments in many developing countries in Africa and Asia. These studies include SACMEQ, PIRLS and prePIRLS, EGRA, and ASER. The aim of these assessments is to facilitate the expansion of quality education by providing the necessary data to monitor educational quality, and by improving the research capacity and technical skills of educational planners. Within the context of major transitions throughout the world, the organisations mentioned above perspicaciously focused on countries that encounter major challenges in literacy. The extensive studies on reading and writing that were conducted by some of these organisations amplify the crisis in education and the plight of early grade learners. Nationally and internationally the situation appears to be relatively bleak, especially for L 2 learners. Literacy, specifically reading literacy, forms the backbone of scholastic success at primary, secondary and tertiary levels and research consistently shows that learners who are good readers also tend to perform well academically (Pretorius & <b>Machet</b> 2004 : 129). Emanating from the above, this study focused on the factors that affect foundation phase English second language learners’ reading and writing skills. The study was conducted at five English medium primary schools in Port Shepstone. A literature study on second language acquisition and the factors that impact on the English second language learners’ reading and writing achievements was undertaken. Furthermore, the expansion of the English language, the significance of the primary language in second language acquisition, insights and issues focusing on bilingualism and multilingualism, theories on second language acquisition, reading and writing in the home language, and factors related to English second language learners’ reading and writing achievements were examined. A mixed-method research design was utilised. In order to obtain an in-depth perspective both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data from foundation phase educators, and the parents of isiZulu-speaking foundation phase learners. Survey questionnaires, which were the main research instruments for gathering data, were distributed to the parents of isiZulu-speaking learners and the educators. Additionally, individual interviews were conducted with educators and reading and writing observations were also conducted. Quantitative data analysis was done by means of tables, frequencies, and graphs. Qualitative data was subjected to analysis by means of an eclectic approach. This study found that cultural, psychological, social, cognitive, school, and developmental factors do indeed affect the second language learners’ reading and writing skills. It was found that the learners’ home language background significantly affected their pronunciation of words in English, their ability to use phonics to read and write, and their ability to differentiate between male and female when writing sentences. Moreover, no specific model of acculturation was found to be apparent in this study. However, the processes of integration and separation did {{play a role in the}} learners’ acculturation. On the other hand, the processes of assimilation and maginalisation were not found amongst isiZulu-speaking learners. Two prominent psychological factors, anxiety and motivation, were apparent in this study. This study revealed that isiZulu-speaking learners do experience reading and writing anxiety but do not experience writing test anxiety. It was also found that isiZulu-speaking learners do enjoy reading in English and they demonstrate relatively positive attitudes towards reading. Their attitudes towards writing in English were somewhat varied. Although integrative motivation and instrumental motivation were seen to play a dual role in the learners’ experiences, the parents’ views were strongly influenced by instrumental motivation. IsiZulu-speaking learners have good social relationships with their peers. Educators affirmed that these learners interact relatively well with both their English-speaking peers and their isiZulu-speaking peers. The amiable relationships were also observed by the researcher during the classroom reading and writing observations. None of the isiZulu-speaking learners experienced social isolation or alienation at any of the five English medium schools. IsiZulu-speaking learners’ ability to speak and understand isiZulu is relatively good. However, their ability to read and write in isiZulu is generally poor. IsiZulu-speaking learners usually cope well with conversational skills in the English language. However, their ability to read English texts fluently with understanding and to write simple stories in English ranges from fair to poor. Generally, at the five schools similar approaches were used to teach reading and writing. The dominance of the phonic approach was observed during several reading lessons. In general, educators expressed their absolute dissatisfaction with the CAPS document and the CAPS English home language workbook. They were not content with the manner in which the phonics is structured in the CAPS workbook and document. Educators asserted that CAPS is too challenging for most isiZulu-speaking learners, too much of emphasis is placed on assessments, and due to the large learner/educator ratio educators experience frustration when teaching reading and writing. Educators emphasised the significance of Grade R attendance and the Grade R curriculum. Furthermore, they asserted that learners who enter Grade 1 at the age of five are not ready for formal schooling and they generally experience reading and writing difficulties. Moreover, this study reproduced those found in literature that showed that generally girls significantly outperform boys on reading and writing tasks. There were various reasons for the parents wanting their children to learn to read and write in English. Two of the prominent reasons advanced by the parents were: parents want their children to learn more than one language and learning English at school will help their children to continue their studies at colleges or universities. Overall, this study has demonstrated that the English language has significantly impacted on all aspects of the isiZulu-speaking foundation phase learners’ lives, and more especially has considerably influenced their reading and writing achievements at English medium schools.
