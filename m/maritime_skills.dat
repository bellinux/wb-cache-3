60|$|Defeated as {{a general}} theory, the Protectionist {{doctrine}} finds support in some particular cases from considerations which, when really in point, involve greater interests than mere saving of labor—the interests of national subsistence and of national defense.(359) The discussions on the Corn Laws have familiarized everybody with the plea {{that we ought to}} be independent of foreigners for the food of the people; and the Navigation Laws were grounded, in theory and profession, on the necessity of keeping up a “nursery of seamen” for the navy. On this last subject I at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice; and that a country exposed to invasion by sea, if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet, is quite right in obtaining those means, even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport. When the English navigation laws were enacted, the Dutch, from their <b>maritime</b> <b>skill</b> and their low rate of profit at home, were able to carry for other nations, England included, at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves: which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war. The navigation laws, by which this deficiency was remedied, and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which England was then frequently engaged in hostilities, were probably, though economically disadvantageous, politically expedient. But English ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country, maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade. The ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer, and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade.|$|R

40|$|Dubrovnik je gotovo tisuću godina imao izvrsno organizirane arsenale, u kojima su se gradile, čuvale, naoružavale i održavale galije i drugi tipovi ratnih brodova. Dubrovački brodograditelji u svojim su arsenalima gradili i najveće suvremene tipove galija. U ovom radu izlažu se argumenti kojima se dokazuje višestoljetni primat Dubrovnika u gradnji i naoružavanju brodova, osobito galija trirema i birema na istočnojadranskoj obali. Analiziraju se navigacijske osobine trirema i birema i njihova efikasnosti u borbi protiv napadača koji bi ugrozio dubrovački teritorij ili ometao sigurnu plovidbu brodova s vrijednom robom. For centuries Dubrovnik {{managed to}} retain a {{significant}} strategic role on the Eastern Adriatic. Its port lied on the busy sea and land communications, while its arsenals and war galleys - triremes and biremes in particular - contributed to the untrammelled development of trade. These vessels also served {{for the protection of}} the City and its port, as well as the entire territorial waters of the Republic. According to the records, Dubrovnik’ arsenals date from the year 782, when the first berths were built, and where closed down at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The arsenals of the Dubrovnik Republic were facilitated with ten building berths: four berths in the Great Arsenal, three in the Small Arsenal of the City port, plus three berths in the arsenal of Mali Ston. Judging by the size of the shipyard (42 m long and 10. 25 m wide in the 14 th c., or 52 m in length by the end of the 15 th c.), one can presume that the largest galleys of the time could be constructed and maintained here. The archives reveal that the Ragusan triremes and biremes differred in size, the greatest being those rowed by men who sat on 25 benches. A smaller type of galley (galijica) equipped with 15, 20, and 22 benches was also built in the arsenals of Dubrovnik. Triremes and biremes - warships of the Dubrovnik Republic - were both well armed and equipped, their crews being famed for <b>maritime</b> <b>skill</b> and courage. Ragusan war galleys took part in a number of sea battles. On 13 July 1409, they overpowered a much stronger fleet of Ladislas of Naples in the Pelješac Channel; together with the Byzantine and Croatian fleet they fought against the Saracens; as part of the Norman fleet they took part in the operations against Venice and the Byzantine Empire. They were also to take action against pirates outside the Adriatic waters. In the sixteenth century, Ragusan triremes and biremes sailed across the oceans to America and India, where the Ragusans founded a colony in Goa. There is no doubt that the Republic of Dubrovnik not only kept pace with the seafaring, trade, and shipbuilding mainstreams of Europe and the world, but those of scholarship, culture, and art too, representing thus a unique example on the eastern coast of the Adriatic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} unique pairing of Indigenous and {{maritime}} archaeological approaches in the '(Re) locating Narrunga Project'. Narrunga was a ketch {{built by the}} Narungga Aboriginal community at Point Pearce Mission (Yorke Peninsula, South Australia) {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century and later sunk in the 1940 s. It is argued that convergences between the scholarly interests of Indigenous and maritime archaeological approaches have been slow to develop and that maritime archaeology as a sub-discipline has not capitalized on the insights that can be gained from collaborative approaches between communities and practitioners. Similarly, Indigenous communities in Australia have had few opportunities to work with researchers to record their maritime heritage. As is evident in the Narrunga story told in this research, non-Indigenous records have been complicit in underplaying the <b>maritime</b> achievements and <b>skills</b> of Narungga people and collaborative research can work towards decolonizing this past...|$|R
40|$|The {{maritime}} industry is multinational and multicultural. Understanding which leadership {{skills that are}} effective in such environments is necessary {{to be a successful}} leader. Work experience in multinational companies will give a different insight into which management practices are seen as desirable for future maritime leaders within a global industry. According to trait theories there are properties that can be trained and some that are linked to personality, which are not easily trainable. Since leadership skills are a combination of both trainable and not so trainable skills, it is necessary to understand what types of skills are seen as endorsed, and not endorsed by the future maritime managers. The present paper shows results from a questionnaire study using the GLOBE Leadership questionnaire where 52 master of maritime management students (i. e. maritime managers of the future) rates 112 different leadership skills according to which degree these skills support outstanding leadership or not. The results show which leadership <b>skills</b> the <b>maritime</b> leaders of the future believe will support outstanding leadership. Contrasts between participant with and without work experience form multinational corporations will be shown – giving an indication of how the perception of leadership is changed through work experience in a multi-cultural context. The result will give an insight in how future management practices should be. Knowledge of the universally endorsed <b>maritime</b> leadership <b>skills</b> {{can be used as a}} guideline in the recruitment process for maritime managers...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} causes, events and {{outcomes of the}} two largest British naval mutinies and their revolutionary potential during {{the era of the}} French Revolution. Previous historians have attempted to define these mutinies through a variety of mono-causal explanations such as material demands and political theory; each has failed as they did not identify the divisions that existed between the seamen. My research examines the impact of masculine identities of working-class men, in this case British seamen. By returning agency to the seamen, I have concluded that these men were divided in their ideas about manhood and these divisions shaped the motives, courses, and outcomes of the two major mutinies in the Royal Navy of 1797. Competing understandings of gender identity divided the seamen. One faction of seamen promoted revolutionary ideas imported from France which defined all men as political equals; the others saw their manhood defined by the traditional plebeian <b>maritime</b> values of <b>skill,</b> bravery, and nationalism. The plebeian seamen mutinied over material grievances. The revolutionary seamen attempted to use the resulting social chaos to redirect the mutinies to political and social revolutions. But the revolution was short lived and failed, not due to the actions of the state, which was largely an observer to the events, but because the plebeian seamen would not accept ideas and actions that made them betray the monarch and nation and therefore their sense of manhood. Using violent measures, these seamen suppressed their revolutionary brethren and ended the mutinies, much to the state's relief. My research will explain how a working-class revolution took place in Britain in the 1790 s, and why it was defeated not by {{the power of the state}} but by other working-class men who believed that the new revolutionary ideology and masculine understandings that it promoted were incompatible with their plebeian maritime concept of masculinity. My dissertation concludes that a British revolution did occur on the decks of the Royal Navy, but it was defeated by a gender-based division among the seamen...|$|R
40|$|Students of BP 2 IP Surabaya are the {{candidates}} of deck or engine officers {{who will be}} on duty on board ship and will encounter many tasks which require English communication skills such as speaking and writing. In order to facilitate those <b>skills,</b> <b>Maritime</b> English has been taught to the students and writing in English also {{has been one of}} the requirements to pass the seafaring courses on BP 2 IP Surabaya. Thus, according to the students, writing is an essential skill to be improved. Recently the issue of self-esteem widely investigated and found correlated with the improvement of writing ability among students. Based on that, this study was conducted. The present study is an attempt to investigate the correlation between EFL writing ability and self-esteem of BP 2 IP Surabaya students. The data were collected using two instruments; Test of English Writing and Questionnaire of Self- esteem which covers three sections of questionnaire; global self-esteem, situational self-esteem and task self-esteem. The instruments were distributed to 107 students of BP 2 IP Surabaya who were adolescents and high school graduates. The first instrument administered was the Test of English Writing and the second was the three sections of Questionnaire of Self-esteem. Subsequently, the data were analyzed using Pearson Product Moment. The result revealed the highest number of students were in good to average writing ability level, the second highest number of students lied in fair writing ability level and the third in poor writing ability level, meanwhile the lowest number of students were in very poor writing ability level and the second lowest were in excellent to very good writing ability level. It was found that in general the students' writing ability level was fair which is generally experience great difficulty while they are writing in EFL, they are also not yet feasible to compete with the native writers. Concerning the self-esteem level of BP 2 IP Surabaya students, the level of global self-esteem, situational self-esteem and task self-esteem were all in moderate level. The correlation between overall self-esteem and writing ability of BP 2 IP Surabaya students was shown significantly positive. The highest level of correlation appeared between situational self-esteem and writing ability, meanwhile the lowest level of correlation appeared between global self-esteem and writing ability. Consequently, it can be concluded that the effort of building student’s self- esteem will lead to the improvement of their writing ability. A preparatory course is needed to improve the writing ability as well as the other skills in English. It was recommended for the EFL teachers to facilitate a healthy learning environment within the semi-military circumstance by supporting a non-threatening interaction between teacher and students or among students...|$|R
