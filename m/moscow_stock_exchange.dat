5000|$|Ryabushinsky {{was born}} into an Old Believer family that had prospered in the 19th century; like other scions of such {{merchant}} families, {{he had a good}} education (he spoke French, German, and English) and was anxious both to be accepted into high society and to improve his country. In 1907 he began publishing his own newspaper, Utro Rossii (The Morning of Russia), to propagate his liberal views. Rebuffed by the Constitutional Democrats, {{who did not want to}} be associated with the [...] "narrow class interests" [...] of industrialists, he and his fellow Old Believer Alexander Konovalov established contact with the [...] "Right Kadets" [...] associated with Peter Struve and began the Economic Discussions of 1909-12, [...] "one of the few sustained collaborations between entrepreneurs and intellectuals in Russian history" [...] (West, p. 46). He and Konovalov founded the Progressist Party, which in 1915 became part of the Progressive Bloc; that same year he was elected Chairman of the <b>Moscow</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> Committee and was appointed to head the Moscow War Industry Committee. This organisation exercised considerable autonomy from the Central War Industry Committee, negotiating contracts between entrepreneurs and the Military directly After the February Revolution he opposed the Soviet and the participation of socialists in the Provisional Government; following the failure of the Kornilov Affair, which he supported, he withdrew from politics and went to the Crimea for a tuberculosis cure. After the October Revolution he was accused of giving financial support to the All-Russian Teachers' Union, who had refused to continue to work under Bolshevik instruction. He subsequently emigrated to France, where he continued to hope that he and his entrepreneurial class might eventually play a role in the development of his native country.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} among financial researchers that the traditional models of asset returns cannot capture essential time series properties of the current stock return data. We examine commonly used models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) family, and show that these models cannot account for the essential characteristics of the real Istanbul Stock Exchange and <b>Moscow</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> returns. These models often fail, and when they succeed, they do {{at the cost of}} an increasing number of parameters and structural equations. The measures of risk obtained from these models do not reflect the true risk to traders, since they cannot capture all key features of the data. In this paper, we offer an alternative framework of analysis based on multifractal models. Compared to the traditional models, the multifractal models we use are very parsimonious and replicate all key features of the data with only three universal parameters. The multifractal models have superior risk evaluation performance. They also produce better forecasts at all scales. The paper also offers a justification of the multifractal models for financial modeling. Key words: fractal Brownian motion, H�, lder exponent, multifractal market hypothesis, multifractal spectrum, scaling phenomena, statistical self-similarity, Wavelet transform,...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} {{of this article is}} the mutual {{international}} settlements between Russia (i. e. its border regions) and China in yuans.

The objective {{of this article is to}} reveal the role of China in the international activities of the Russian near-border regions on the basis of the analysis of export and import statistics database.
