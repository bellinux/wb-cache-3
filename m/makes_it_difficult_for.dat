5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars argue that a lengthy relationship with the government <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the agency to become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Bc5 may {{not seem}} {{particularly}} useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2 diagonal via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal {{to put pressure on}} f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected {{by the state of}} Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy {{to enable them to}} escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E

5|$|The lack of radial nodes in the 2p {{subshell}} {{is directly}} responsible {{for many of the}} anomalous properties of the first row of the p-block, especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating orbital hybridisation. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. Hypervalency is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E
