40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of fully developed fluid flows in concentric annuli with rough surfaces and <b>moving</b> <b>cores,</b> by analytically predicting {{the effects of}} surface roughness, core velocity and turbulent motion on the momentum and heat transfer characteristics of the flow, such as friction forces, velocity profiles, temperature profiles and heat transfer. The analytical predictions are produced by a mathematical model based on an adaptation of Prandtl's mixing length theories and on the data of previous studies of turbulent flow in annuli and rectangular channels which were artificially roughened. The computer program developed for this study employs an iterative process to match velocity and temperature profiles with force and energy balances and calculates the desired momentum and thermal characteristics. The results indicate excellent correlation with previous experimental data on rough annuli with static cores and smooth annuli with <b>moving</b> <b>cores.</b> From these results, the combined effects of surface roughness and <b>moving</b> <b>cores</b> are inferred. New equations are proposed for predicting the radius of maximum fluid velocity {{and the effects of}} core velocity on roughness, in terms of annulus radius ratio, roughness geometry, flow's Reynolds number and core velocity. The study demonstrates the advantages, under certain conditions, of using roughness elements to increase heat transfer and enhance the overall efficiency in the energy transfer processes involved...|$|R

The governing boundary-layer equations are discretized by means of a control volume finite-difference technique and numerically solved using the marching procedure. It is found from the study that (i) the streamwise movement of the inner core causes an attenuation in the normal Reynolds stresses, although the inherent anisotropy is maintained and the appreciable turbulence remains, (ii) the Reynolds stress in the inner wall region is substantially diminished due to the inner core movement, resulting in a decrease in the heat transfer performance, and (iii) an increase in the velocity ratio of the <b>moving</b> inner <b>core</b> of the fluid flow induces a decrease in the Nusselt number as well as the Reynolds stress in the region near the inner core...|$|R

40|$|The {{mixed state}} of extreme type II superconductors is studied order to {{determine}} how an applied transport current interacts with vortices. The Ginzburg-Landau theory is applied first to determine the force balance equation on stationary vortices in the mixed state. Motivated by experimental data on the recently discovered Hall angle anomaly in the mixed state, we also investigate the flux flow state in which vortices move with a constant velocity. The two fundamental models for the flux flow state, one suggested by Bardeen and Stephen and the other by Nozieres and Vinen, are studied {{with a focus on}} the force balance equation and the paramagnetic current at the vortex core. To further study the paramagnetic current generated in a <b>moving</b> vortex <b>core,</b> we resort to the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. By making use of the solution obtained by Caroli et al for a stationary vortex, we solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a vortex in the flux flow state via a perturbative method. The paramagnetic current at a <b>moving</b> vortex <b>core</b> is determined using this solution. We find that the paramagnetic current and the related dissipation at the vortex core result from a number of concomitant effects. The characteristics of the paramagnetic current due to each effect is determined. From these results, we then obtain microscopically a force balance equation for an isolated moving vortex. Using this force balance equation, we discuss how the Hall angle anomaly can be explained. ...|$|R
