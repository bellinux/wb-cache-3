The structures under consideration {{are not necessarily}} periodic, but their properties (geometry and material) exhibit periodicity with respect to non-linear periodicity functions. The proposed theory {{is based on an}} adequate definition of the admissible deformation fields and the corresponding functional setting, and results from the generalization of the two-scale convergence theory. Moreover, the discrete variational formulation is presented, for both the global and local problems. Additionally, the implicit formulation of the homogenization problem is proposed for elastic-J(2) -plastic constituents with linear hardening in the context of infinitesimal elastoplasticity, including the numerical scheme for homogenization and the derivation of the consistent elastoplastic tangent modulus. Finally, the computational algorithm for the proposed theory is deployed, consisting of four interacting problems, the macroscale, the microscale, the iterative plastic scheme and the effective tangent modulus problem. The theory and the numerical and computational scheme are supplemented by two examples, one of a wavy multilayered structure and one of a <b>multilayered</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E

Numerical examples are used to show that, {{in a single layer}} tube, fiber orientation strongly influences response. When the fibers are aligned axially, all stress components in the tube are small. When the fibers are aligned circumferentially, the hoop stress becomes large. This difference in behavior is due to the large difference between the radial and circumferential coefficients of thermal expansion when the fibers are oriented circumferentially.

The final tubular structures can be characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), microscopy, swelling and mechanical tests, including dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in physiological simulated conditions. More robust films could be produced via chemical cross-linking with genipin. Water uptake decreases from about 390% to 110% after cross-linking.

40|$|Multilayer {{automotive}} fuel lines {{are currently being}} developed in response to stricter environmental legislation governing evaporative emissions. These fuel lines generally have different polymers, an Quter layer (pA 12), a high barrier inner layer (pVdF, THY or PBT) and an adhesive tie layer (modified PA 12) to bond together the outer and inner layers. A range of fuel line polymers were injection moulded and samples immersed in a conventional unleaded fuel, a standard test fuel and fuel components methanol, ethanol and toluene at 20 Ã‚Â°C. Weight gain, swelling and mechanical property analysis showed minimal change for the fluoropolymers but the tie layer resins exhibited gross swelling and significant reduction in mechanical properties. DMTA analysis showed that {{this was due to}} the plasticizing effect ofthe various fluids in the polymer matrices. Elevated temperature immersion studies on nylon 12, PVdF and PBT resins indicated that much higher diffusion coefficients were recorded for the nylon 12 resin, particularly at 600 C. The results also showed that the PVdF exhibited the best barrier performance to these fluids, even at 600 C. A range of <b>multilayer</b> <b>tubes</b> were manufactured at the University and the barrier performance ofthese tubes were determined using an EMS P-tester, the results confirmed that <b>multilayer</b> <b>tubes</b> with a PVdF inner layer exhibited low permeation values. An FTIR-ATR technique was developed to reduce the time tak. ~n to measure the. diffusion of fuel components through polymer films. The results demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients measured using the FTIR-ATR technique correlated well with results obtained using the gravimetric method. The performance of a range of high temperature polymers, PA 4. 6, PEl and (pPEIPA) to selected automotive fluids was also investigated. Relatively high absorptions of Fuel C, aggressive water and zinc chloride were recorded for the nylon 4. 6. whilst the tensile modulus of the PPEIPA resin was shown to deteriorate significantly upon immersion in these fluids.

Biological fluids move through the tubes composed of viscoelastic sheets with different rheological properties.

Numerical investigation of the blood flow through the blood vessels as three-layered viscoelastic tubes revealed some possibilities for the flow stabilization by a proper choice of the material parameters of the layers [1]. An effective numerical algorithm has been elaborated and stability of the steady flow in the tube at different boundary conditions at the outer surface of the tube has been in-depth studied.

40|$|Stochastic {{predictive}} {{control in the}} presence of uncertainty and constraints is an active area of research, but most results available to date concern the case of additive uncertainty or apply constraints in expected value only. In addition, the conventional assumption that model uncertainty is normally distributed prevents the development of suitable guarantees of feasibility and therefore closed loop stability. Some recent work considered the case of multiplicative uncertainty with bounded support and used <b>multilayer</b> <b>tubes</b> in conjunction with Markov chain model to provide feasibility results, but prohibitive computation implied the need to restrict the number of layers with the consequence of that the derived results were conservative. This is overcome in the current paper through the combined use of sampling and mixed integer programming. The novel contribution concerns the construction of terminal sets, the relaxation of constraints through the use of error feedback, the definition of the predicted cost as a quadratic function of the degrees of freedom, and the handling of constraints through sampling and mixed integer programming.

40|$|The {{coupling}} impedance of beam tubes is {{a long-standing}} important topic for particle accelerators that many authors have addressed. The {{present study was}} initiated in view of a specific problem, but its novel approach is broadly applicable to the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances of coated beam <b>tubes</b> or <b>multilayer</b> <b>tubes.</b> The matrix method presented here derives the wall impedance by treating the radial wave propagation of the beam-excited electromagnetic fields in full analogy to longitudinal transmission lines. Starting from the Maxwell equations, the radially transverse magnetic field components are described for monopole and dipole modes by a 2 × 2 matrix. Assuming isotropic material properties within one layer, the transverse field components at the inner boundary of a layer uniquely are determined by matrix transfer of the field components at its outer boundary. By imposing power-flow constraints on the matrix, wave impedance mapping and field matching between layers is enforced and replaced by matrix multiplication. The longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances are derived from the wall impedance at the innermost boundary, and the different procedures for its determination are discussed. The matrix method is demonstrated via selected yet representative examples of the well-documented cases of a stainless-steel tube, and of a graphite collimator...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{nanomaterials}} as new nonviral gene carriers {{have attracted}} much attention [10, 11]. Many inorganic materials including gold, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and various inorganic oxide nanoparticles have been intensively studied [9 – 16]. Halloysites are an economically and abundantly viable clay material that can be mined from deposits [17]. Halloysite Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ·nH 2 O is a naturally occurring two-layered aluminosilicate, chemically similar to kaolin, which has a predominantly high-aspect-ratio hollow tubular structure in the submicrometer range and an internal diameter in the nanometer range [18]. As for most natural materials, the size of halloysite nanotubes [HNTs] generally varies from 50 to 70 nm in external diameter, a ca. 15 -nm diameter lumen, and 0.5 to 1 μm in length. The neighboring alumina and silica layers create a packing disorder causing them to curve and roll up, forming <b>multilayer</b> <b>tubes.</b> In each HNT, the external surface is composed of siloxane (Si-O-Si) groups, whereas the internal surface consists of a gibbsite-like array of aluminol (Al-OH) groups. Even though much less studied than carbon nanotubes, due to their interesting structure and features such as unique tubular structure, large aspect ratio, cheap and abundant availability, rich functionality, good biocompatibility, and high mechanical strength, HNTs are attractive materials that show great promise {{in a range of}} applications as a nanoscale container for the encapsulation of biologically active molecules (e.g., biocides, enzymes, and drugs), as a support for immobilization of catalyst molecules, controlled drug delivery, bioimplants, and for protective coating (e.g., anticorrosion or antimolding) [19 – 23]. Despite these prospects, however, their utilization as biocarrier for ASODNs delivery has been less investigated so far.|$|R
40|$|Halloysite (HNT) is {{a natural}} clay that, in the last years, has shown an {{important}} increasing on various applications in different field of interesting. Chemically similar to kaolin, it shows the predominately rolled shape, to form <b>multilayers</b> <b>tubes</b> of nanometric dimensions. The different chemical composition of the inside lumen (Al-OH) surface and outside (Si-O) give to the tubes a partial negative charge outside and positive inside. In this way, {{it is possible to}} get different interactions of different molecules or systems selectivity on one or another surface. The selective functionalization, covalent or not, of the HNT lumen or outer surface, gives the possibility to the nanotubes to further expand and modulate their properties, increasing the potential efficacy and the application fields. Recently some studies are, also, focused on the edges and interlayer properties and potentials. Among the countless applications of halloysite, is central the nanotube ability to interact with metals. Metals ions are one of the worst pollutants in the environmental contest. Halloysite has shown interesting properties as starting point to make environmental recovery system. Another important application of the ability of HNT of interaction with metals is catalysis. Catalyst immobilization is a good opportunity to obtain materials that can be recovered and reused for several cycles with low leaching. Several studies have been carried out on the use of ionic liquids as reaction media and as stabilizers for metal nanoparticles. In particular, great attention has been devoted to the use of supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) -based materials as heterogeneous recyclable palladium catalyst.

40|$|In {{solar tower}} plants {{absorber}} tubes {{are the main}} components of various solar receivers, e. g. steam, salt, pressurized air receivers. The solar radiation on the absorber tube causes an inhomogeneous temperature distribution because most of the solar radiation along the tube circumference is one-sided. The resulting internal stresses of the tube decrease the lifetime and the maximum fluid temperature significantly, especially when heat transfer coefficients are low. Within the projects SOLHYCO and FUTUR a profiled <b>multilayer</b> <b>tube</b> (PML) is currently under development in order to reduce this problem. It consists of three metallic layers: a high temperature nickel-based alloy at the outer side, a copper layer as intermediate layer and another high temperature nickel-based alloy at the inner side of the tube. The outer layer provides the structural strength while the copper is used to conduct the heat from the irradiated side to the opposite side. The inner layer protects the copper from corrosion and oxidation at high temperatures. In addition, a wire coil is inserted (profiled) to increase the heat transfer on the inside. The PML is manufactured in a hydro-forming process by deforming the tube composite with water under high pressure. To demonstrate the performance and to determine the heat transfer, the pressure loss and the temperature distribution, a test loop was built to simulate the different loads under laboratory conditions. The thermo hydraulic measurements and finite element calculations show that the temperature gradient and the maximum temperature can be reduced significantly.

One potential approach to overcome the current limitations of electron-beam lithography may involve the use of hybrid systems, in which existing lithographic techniques are coupled with “bottom up” approaches such as supramolecular self-assembly. In this respect, biological systems offer some unique possibilities as they combine both self-organization and spatial patterning at the nanometer length scale. In particular, Surface Layer Proteins (S-layers) can facilitate high order organization and specific orientation of inorganic structures as they are two-dimensional porous crystalline membranes with regular structure at the nanometer scale.

In vitro recrystallization experiments have shown that wild type SslA self-assembles into monolayers, <b>multilayers</b> or <b>tubes.</b> Factors such as initial monomer concentration, Ca 2 + ions, pH of the recrystallization buffer and the presence of a silicon substrate have a strong influence on the recrystallization process.

This remarkable property of self-assembling has been preserved even when SslA was truncated. The deletion of both, N- and C-terminal SslA domains does not hinder self-assembly; the resulting protein is able to form extended monolayers that exhibit the p 4 lattice symmetry. The central SslA-domain is self sufficient for the self-assembly. The possibility to change the natural properties of S-layers by genetic engineering techniques opens a new horizon for the tuning of their structural and functional features. The SslA-streptavidin fusion protein combines the remarkable property of self-assembling with the ligand i. e. biotin binding function. On silicon wafers, this chimeric protein recrystallized into coherent protein layers and exposes streptavidin, fact demonstrated by binding studies using biotinylated quantum dots. In this way, it can serve as a functional surface for controlled immobilization of biologically active molecules but also as a platform for the synthesis of planar arrays of quantum dots. Furthermore, the results open up exciting possibilities for construction of hybrid S-layers, structures that may ultimately promote the fabrication of miniaturized, nanosized electronic devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{final phase}} of {{preparations}} for the ATLAS experiment at the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has begun. In the last decade the collaboration has carried out various test-beam experiments to study and optimize prototypes of all subdetectors under more and more realistic conditions. To enhance the detector-physical understanding, these hardware activities were complemented by detailed simulations. In parallel the development of reconstruction software has made important progress. The present work focusses on some advanced aspects of optimizing the Monitored Drift Tube Chambers (MDT) for operation as precision chambers in the Muon Spectrometer. It will be shown how this system has been tuned for maximum performance {{in order to meet}} the ambitious goals defined by the objectives of LHC particle physics. After defining the basic detector parameters, the tubes' capability of running in ATLAS's high-rate gamma radiation background was verified. Both tasks necessitated several years of gathering experience in muon test beams to which the author has contributed together with colleagues from institutes spread over the entire globe. Although efforts have been made to concentrate on issues for which the writer bore the full responsibility, it was sometimes unavoidable [...] in view of a more coherent treatment of sophisticated contexts [...] to also display results contributed by other collaborators. This is particularly true for the analysis of the high-rate behaviour of drift tubes which was shared with M. Aleksa (CERN), N. Hessey (LMU, now NIKHEF) and W. Riegler (Harvard, now CERN). The employment of a silicon microstrip tracker in the test-beam experiments yielded an unprecedented precision in the understanding of the subtleties of drift-chamber physics. Chapter 6 presents an approach for taking advantage of this knowledge in the reconstruction of muon tracks through a <b>multilayer</b> of <b>tubes.</b> The momentum resolution and the track reconstruction efficiency of the muon spectrometer achieved with the optimized detector system were investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation. A central aspect of this study was the impact of the non-Gaussian errors in the drift-tube response near the anode wires on the spectrometer performance. Finally, techniques for the calibration of the space-time relationship of drift tubes were developed. Since in ATLAS no external reference detector will be available, the muon system has to be self-calibrating. This task will be accomplished by exploiting muon tracks from normal LHC operation. For each calibration method the attainable precision and the applicability for ATLAS MDT chambers are discussed. Here again, the results from the beam tests proved to be an indispensable input. Based on these insights a scenario for the in-situ calibration of all ATLAS MDT chambers is outlined. This includes a strategy for the definition of the spatial ``autocalibration zones'' in the spectrometer within which a calibration of the space-time relationship is valid. A simple estimate of the number of muons needed for a full calibration shows that approximately one day of normal data-taking is sufficient to collect the required statistics...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is the development and evaluation of a mathematical model that captures the deformation behavior of the human airway under smooth muscle contraction. The problem consists of a <b>multilayered</b> circular cylindrical <b>tube</b> subjected to an active contractile stress generated by the smooth muscle layer. The problem formulation assumes axisymmetric deformation for an incompressible isotropic neo-Hookean material. The model is formulated as fully nonlinear and accommodates large deformation, since these are expected in the human airway and other soft biological materials. The equilibrium equations are obtained, {{as well as the}} strain-displacement relationship, boundary conditions, and constitutive equations that describe the contractile stress for neo-Hookean hyperelastic solids. The main focus of the project is to obtain the change in airway caliber after a prescribed contractile stress is introduced in the smooth muscle layer. A MATLAB code was written to numerically solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic equation, which obtains the change in airway caliber. The code allows the user to analyze and change the material parameters that govern the solution, as well as input different dimensions for the multilayer cylinder. In the deformation of the airway, the lung parenchyma plays a very important role in preventing full closure of the airway. Here, the lung parenchyma is treated as an infinitely large continuous solid, in which the airway is embedded. The airway generations selected for further investigation are generations 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16. For the lung parenchyma infinite domain assumption, the percent airway caliber change for the critical contractile stresses of the airway generations were 23. 86 %, 23. 68 %, 23. 95 %, 24. 56 %, and 25. 51 % for generations 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively. ^ The mathematical model does not account for the buckling that is observed in the deformation of the human airway, since the deformation is assumed to be axisymmetric. When the contractile stress in the smooth muscle layer exceeds a certain value, the airway buckles and folds. Therefore, finite element simulations were conducted using ABAQUS software to determine the critical contractile stress at which the airway will buckle. Buckling analyses were performed in order to obtain the buckling modes of the airway, as well as the critical load that will cause the it to buckle, for airway generations 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. The critical load in which the airway buckles and folds for these generations of the airway are 1. 755 kPa, 1. 572 kPa, 1. 493 kPa, 1. 426 kPa, and 1. 374 kPa respectively. Contractile stresses used in the analytical model that are larger than the critical buckling loads will provide invalid results since the assumptions made to develop the model will no longer be valid. After the buckling analysis, the first buckling mode is introduced in a post buckling analysis in order to obtain the average change in caliber and the active contractile stresses. ...|$|R
