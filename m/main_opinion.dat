Sec. 1982 (1988) which he argued applied solely to the property rights of citizens. Brown challenged as unwarranted the seizure of his personal property. The three-judge court upheld the convictions on March 21, 1995, with Circuit Judge Alice M. Batchelder dissenting from the <b>main</b> <b>opinion</b> of Boyce F. Martin, Jr. and Richard Alan Enslen. Batchelder held that the search warrants against Brown were invalid, and that, though the action of shooting at a synagogue should have been criminalized by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 247, the wording of that law was insufficient to give protection to people who utilize property such as a synagogue but who do not own a share of it. Batchelder wrote that Congress should amend the law to widen its coverage. Batchelder agreed with the court opinion that Brown's conviction of perjury should stand.|$|E
