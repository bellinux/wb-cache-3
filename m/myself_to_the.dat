Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media. Five months after joining, Franklin left the group. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress. Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision making. Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, disclosed that her inclusion in the group resulted in her [...] "battling insecurity": [...] "I was comparing <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other members, and the pressure was on me." ...|$|E

If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next level with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just {{wanted to take the}} energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E

Until samadhi, the sadhaka gropes in the darkness aided by Guru.|$|E

[...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to force <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conviction that the troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment.

2500|$|A staunch anti-Fascist, West {{attacked}} {{both the}} Conservative governments {{of her own}} country for appeasing Adolf Hitler and her colleagues on the left for their pacifism. Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted Joseph Stalin. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that Communism facilitated. She was outraged when the Allies switched their loyalties in regards to Yugoslav resistance movements by deciding in 1943 to start backing the Communist-led Partisans led by Tito in Yugoslavia, thus abandoning their support of Draža Mihailović's Chetniks, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance. She expressed her feelings and opinions on the Allies' switch in Yugoslavia by writing the satirical short story titled [...] "Madame Sara's Magic Crystal", but decided not to publish it upon discussion with Orme Sargent, Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office. Writing in her diary, West mentioned Sargent persuaded her that [...] "the recognition of Tito was made by reason of British military necessities, and for no other reason" [...] and following Sargent's claim, she described her decision not to publish the story {{as an expression of}} [...] "personal willingness to sacrifice <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of my country".
