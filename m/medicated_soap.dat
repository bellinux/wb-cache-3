These substances contain ingredients called biocide responsible for destruction of Microorganisms. The presence of numerous of antimicrobial consumer products in everyday life lacks a scientific foundation It may {{be more of a}} marketing phenomenon The emergence of fake products, calls for need to investigate on the s 0 —called antimicrobial products (<b>medicated</b> <b>soaps),</b> since definitely will adversely affect the consumers. The study objective was survey and evaluates anti-microbial activity of <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> commonly used by Dar es Salaam residents. Specific objectives are; survey on <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> that are available in the market and assessment antimicrobial activity o the <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps.</b> Methodology: Survey on <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> that avail in the market, was carried out during a four months period,. A total of l 2 samples were collected during a study—period of four months and the collected samples were assessed for antimicrobial activities by two methods namely: 1) Hand washing and 2) Cap plate method Most assayed soaps showed convincing antimicrobial activities against bacteria, although some <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> having the same active ingredient had shown different antimicrobial activities. This could be due to the difference in concentration of active ingredients in these soaps or interactions of the soap components rendering it inefficacious The assayed soaps have shown a very low antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and some showed NO activity at all. This could be because these soaps are labeled to have antibacterial activity rather than antifungal activity. This study has revealed that most <b>Medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> have antibacterial activities although they differ in strength Some have low activity and some has high activities...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{evaluation}} of the anti-microbial activity of <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> was conducted using ditch-plate and hand washing techniques. Strains of reference microbes namely Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aureginosa (ATCC 27853) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) were tested at three different soaps’ concentrations (1. 0, 4. 0 and 8. 0 mg/ml). A total of 16 <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> were assayed for their antimicrobial efficacy. Of these, 13 were medicated and 3 non-medicated soaps, which served as control. Ciprofloxacin and ketaconazole were employed as positive controls. Label disclosure for the soaps’ ingredients and other relevant information were absorbed. The most common antimicrobial active ingredients were triclosan, trichloroxylenol and trichlorocarbanilide. ANOVA for means of zones of inhibition revealed variability of antimicrobial activity among the <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps.</b> Positive correlation (r= 0. 318; P< 0. 01) between zones of inhibition and soaps’ concentrations was evidenced. Hand washing frequencies positively correlated with microbial counts. Roberts® soap exhibited the largest zone of inhibition (34 mm) on S. aureus. Candida albicans was the least susceptible microbe. Regency® and Dalan® exhibited the least zone of inhibition on the tested bacteria. Protex®, Roberts®, Family® and Protector® were equally effective (P< 0. 01) against S. aureus. In conclusion, majority of the assayed <b>medicated</b> <b>soaps</b> have satisfactory antibacterial activity; though lack antifungal effect with exception of Linda® liquid soap.

40|$|Background: A multi centre {{double-blind}} randomised-controlled trial (M-RCT), {{carried out}} in the Netherlands in 2005 – 2007, showed that hospitalised patients with S. aureus nasal carriage who were treated prophylactically with mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine gluconate <b>medicated</b> <b>soap</b> (MUP-CHX), had a significantly lower risk of health-care associated S. aureus infections than patients receiving placebo (3. 4 % vs. 7. 7 %, RR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 23 – 0. 75). The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether treatment of patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery with MUP-CHX (screen-and-treat strategy) affected the costs of patient care. Methods: We compared hospital costs of patients undergoing cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery (n = 415) in one of the participating centres of the M-RCT. Data from the ‘Planning and Control ’ department were used to calculate total hospital costs of the patients. Total costs were calculated including nursing days, costs of surgery, costs for laboratory and radiological tests, functional assessments and other costs. Costs for personnel, materials and overhead were also included. Mean costs in the two treatment arms were compared using the t-test for equality of means (two-tailed). Subgroup analysis was performed for cardiothoracic and orthopaedic patients. Results: An investigator-blinded analysis revealed that costs of care in the treatment arm (MUP-CHX, n = 210) were on average J 1911 lower per patient than costs of care in the placebo arm (n = 205) (J 8602 vs. J 10513, p = 0. 01).

40|$|Background Clean-catch {{midstream}} urine (MSU) {{remains the}} standard procedure for urine collection even if it's role to reduce bacterial contamination rate is unclear. Objective To compare bacterial contamination rate between clean-catch (cleaning urethral meatus with <b>medicated</b> <b>soap)</b> and non clean-catch MSU among boys. Methods An experimental study with parallel groups and block randomization was conducted. Toilet-trained boys aged 3 to 18 years, without symptoms or signs of {{urinary tract infection}} were recruited from the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic at Sardjito Hospital and from a local elementary school. Subjects with history of renal disease, those who were on under antibiotic treatment in the preceding week, or with meatal abnormality or non-cooperative were excluded. Urine specimen was collected by a trained nurse, and was cultured within one hour by personnel blinded to the assignment. Significant bacteriuria was defined as growth of a single pathogenic organism (degree of pathogenicity group I-III) with colony count 2 : 105 colony forming unit/mi. Contamination was defined as any growth not fulfilling criteria for significant bacteriuria or growth of multiple organisms. Results A total of 80 boys were enrolled. The contamination rate in the clean-catch group was 13 % (5 out of 40) compared with 10 % (4 out of 40) in the non clean-catch group (P=l. O). The adjusted risk ratio for contamination in the clean-catch MSU group, adjusted to age and circumcision status, was 1. 37 (95 % CI 0. 42; 4. 51).

40|$|Patient {{safety in}} {{hospital}} care depends on effective infection control (IC) programmes. The Antimicrobial Resistance Prevention and Control (ARPAC) study assessed the organisation, components {{and human resources}} of IC programmes in European hospitals. A questionnaire survey of policies and procedures implemented in 2001 for the surveillance and control of nosocomial infection and antibiotic resistance was completed by 169 acute-care hospitals from 32 European countries, categorised by five geographical regions. A formal IC programme existed in 72 % of hospitals, and a multidisciplinary IC committee was operational in 90 %. Trained IC nurses (ICNs) were present in 80 % of hospitals (ranging from 54 % in south-east and central-eastern Europe, to 100 % in northern Europe), whereas 74 % had one or more trained IC doctors (ICDs) (ranging from 46 % in south-east Europe to 84 % in western Europe). Median staffing levels were 2. 33 ICNs/ 1, 000 beds and 0. 94 ICDs/ 1, 000 beds. The intensity of IC programmes scored higher in centres from northern and western Europe than from other European regions. Written guidelines promoted hand hygiene for healthcare workers in 89 % of hospitals, education in 85 %, and audit in 46 %. Guidelines recommended use of alcohol-based solutions (70 %) and/or medicated/antiseptic soap (43 %) for decontamination of non-soiled hands. Use of alcohol-based solutions varied according to region, from 41 % in southern Europe to 100 % in northern Europe, compared with use of <b>medicated</b> <b>soap</b> from 77 % in southern Europe to 11 % in northern Europe (p < 0. 01).
