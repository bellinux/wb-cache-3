25|$|Relative {{risks are}} {{affected}} by the prevalence of the condition in the reference group (in contrast to likelihood ratios, which are not), and this issue results in that the validity of post-test probabilities become less valid with increasing difference between the prevalence in the reference group and the pre-test probability for any individual. Any known risk factor or previous test of an individual almost always confers such a difference, decreasing the validity of using relative risks in estimating the total effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>risk</b> factors or tests. Most physicians do not appropriately take such differences in prevalence into account when interpreting test results, which may cause unnecessary testing and diagnostic errors.|$|E

If people are non-EU maximizers, self-protection and self-insurance also decline when they follow the conservatism heuristic (insufficient weighting of new information).

50|$|There {{are four}} key risk {{factors that are}} {{associated}} with educational disadvantages upon entry into kindergarten in the United States. They include having a mother with less than a high school education, living in a family that receives food stamps or welfare, living in a single-parent home, and having parents whose native tongue is other than English (United States Department of Education, 2001). Individuals with a single risk factor are likely to lag in reading or writing skills; those with <b>multiple</b> <b>risk</b> factors have a 50% chance of scoring in the bottom quartiles in reading, mathematics, or general knowledge. For example, those with <b>multiple</b> <b>risk</b> factors are less likely to know the alphabet or be able to count to 20 before beginning kindergarten, which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison to other students without risk factors (p. 21). Families who live in poverty are generally less able to provide learning opportunities, such as books or toys to their children. Lack of school readiness has been linked with later school dropout. However, longitudinal studies in Quebec suggest that social-emotional and social skills training can help some students improve their academic paths and eventually graduate from high school.|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of entrepreneurial uptake by water-scarce farmers explores how farmers accumulate social and human capitals while managing <b>multiple</b> <b>risks</b> in {{current and future}} livelihood choices. Social networking and human capital accumulation differentially impact on successes in agriculture and entrepreneurial ventures.

Results suggest that {{in the presence of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>risks,</b> farmers may act to increase their investments in human capital even when chances of finding a suitable business opportunity are low; whereas in some cases, they may accumulate higher social capital to enhance their farm subsidy support even under better chances of finding suitable business opportunities.
