This was not without incident; the depth of water was found to be only 15 feet (4.5 meters) instead of the 18 feet (5.8 meters) that was expected. At least one ship that the Administration wanted in the expedition, USS Colorado, drew too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across. To Farragut, the most serious problem {{presented}} by the failed effort to bring Colorado into the river was not the reduction in the force he had available, but rather the lost time. With Colorado subtracted, the fleet inside the bar included six ships and twelve gunboats.|$|E
500|$|... "Back to the Shack" [...] {{was written}} by Rivers Cuomo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. The song was {{produced}} by Ric Ocasek. Cuomo wrote {{a majority of the}} song, with Karl Koch describing Jacob Kasher Hindlin's contribution to the song as [...] "randomly singing out the title while hanging out on the couch listening to [...] strumming the song. It doesn't take <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> half a songwriting credit." [...] At one point, the song was performed with the bridge containing the lyric [...] "we belong in the rock zone", before Cuomo, based on fan suggestions changed it from [...] "rock zone" [...] to [...] "rock world". Regarding the composition of the song, Cuomo stated that he [...] "tried to find different melodies and different beats and all these different things." [...] Further, he stated that as he [...] "couldn't crack the code" [...] they had to go ahead and record it anyway. Ocasek introduced a synth melody line to the song during this period.|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, {{during his}} {{extensive}} promotion for the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass, Harrison named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] among his three favourite tracks on the album. The electronic press kit accompanying the release included {{a scene where}} Harrison plays back the song at his Friar Park studio and isolates {{certain parts of the}} recording in turn, such as the backing vocals and slide guitars. In the CD booklet, Harrison's liner notes conclude with a thank-you to [...] "the amazing Mr. Phil Spector" [...] and the acknowledgement: [...] "He helped me so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this record made. In his company I came to realise the true value of the Hare Krishna Mantra." [...] The Pope-related lyrics in [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] were again omitted from the booklet; they similarly do not appear on the lyric sheet supplied with the 2014 Apple Years reissue.|$|E

500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting was {{nothing short of}} adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was the highlight of [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit as well as she can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all huffy over. You can say this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, [...] "I've grown up watching [...] and always admired him so <b>much.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> to work with him... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." [...] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt [...] "were more graceful" [...] and [...] "completely different from today's actors." [...] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, [...] "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, [...] "mesmeriz audiences" [...] by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of [...] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, [...] "Deepika has all it takes to be a top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as [...] and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!" [...] At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Padukone was awarded the Best Female Debut Award and received her first nomination in the Best Actress category.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entry into}} Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet was time consuming. The swash, {{thought to be}} eight feet (2.5 m) deep, was found the hard way to be only six feet (1.9 m). Some of the Union Army ships drew too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across, {{and had to be}} kedged in after being lightened. [...] Others were too deep even to be kedged in; the men or {{materials}} they carried had to be brought ashore on Hatteras Island, and the ships sent back.
