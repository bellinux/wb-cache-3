40|$|Land tenure {{insecurity}} {{is widely}} {{perceived as a}} disincentive for long-term land improvement investment hence {{the objective of this}} paper is to evaluate how tenure (in) security associated with different land use arrangements in Ghana influenced households’ plot level investment decisions and choices. The paper uses data from the Farmer-Based Organisations (FBO) survey. The FBO survey collected information from 2, 928 households across three ecological zones of Ghana using multistaged cluster sampling. Probit and Tobit models tested the effects of land tenancy and ownership arrangements on households’ investment behaviour while controlling other factors. It was found that <b>marginal</b> <b>farm</b> size was inversely related to tenure insecurity while tenure insecurity correlate positively with value of farm land and not farm size. Individual ownership and documentation of land significantly reduced the probability of households losing uncultivated lands. Individual land ownership increased both the probability of investing and level of investments made in land improvement and irrigation probably due to increasing importance households place on land ownership. Two possible explanations for this finding are: First, that land markets and land relations have changed significantly over the last two decades with increasing money transaction and fixed agreements propelled by population growth and increasing value of land. Secondly, inclusion of irrigation investment as a long term investment in land raises the value of household investment and the time period required to reap the returns on the investments. Households take land ownership and duration of tenancy into consideration if the resource implications of land investments are relatively huge and the time dimension for harvesting returns to investments is relatively long...|$|E
40|$|Decentralizing a large, complex {{national}} extension {{system is not}} easy, but the Government of India appears to be moving toward this long-term goal. Although ATMA model {{has been successful in}} addressing many of the extension problems and has shown exceptional impacts during the NATP phase but it seems to be going the T&V way. It is therefore, imperative that in the country like India, which has a vast territory and extremely diverse socio-economic and agro-climatic situations, ATMA model should be introduced and implemented with utter cautious. Different ATMAs should be empowered with sufficient administrative, financial and implementation flexibilities to address the basic problems in their operational jurisdiction. The use of FIGs to mobilize men, women, and young people around common interests, such as the production of flowers, fruits, vegetables, milk, fish and other high-value products, has energized both the farming community and the extension staff. Many FIGs have joined to form farmer associations or federations that can gain economies of scale in serving larger markets. Developing strong farmer organizations is a positive and necessary step in providing cost-effective extension services that will increase the income and employment of small-scale and <b>marginal</b> <b>farm</b> households. The block-level FACs are operational in most project blocks, but rural women and other disadvantaged groups still need more representation. Internal conflicts continue between priorities set by the ATMA Governing Boards and the heads of the line departments in allocating central government resources. The BTTs are still learning how to work together in utilizing a farming systems approach with multiple funding sources. There is no doubt that something that resembles a 21 st centre vision of agricultural extension is needed and this means substantial reforms in public policies and services. Adding urgency to this is the ever-increasing complexity of agricultural sector development and the sector’s acknowledged role in poverty reduction. Of course, it is all too easy to criticise new approaches, such as ATMA. It is also important to realise that in a country like India and, indeed, elsewhere, administrative traditions and realities place limits on what is possible and politically feasible even as a pilot. But the challenge remains of how to break out of this best practice to best fit impasse. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{incentives}} {{has been studied}} for the adoption of {{soil and water conservation}} in the ravines of Gujarat in the context of holistic development of small and <b>marginal</b> <b>farms</b> and their profitability. It is hypothesized that poor economic condition of farmers impedes their ability to make large-scale investment in conservation agriculture, in general and improvement of land, in particular. The study is based on two groups of farms- with and without conservation history. The results have substantiated the argument that under the present price scenario, farm profitability makes the <b>marginal</b> <b>farms</b> susceptible to a vicious poverty circle. The input and output prices prevailing in the region do not favour the farming enterprise. Thus, this policy variable would have little impact on farm profitability and the incentive to adopt conservation on farm. Hence, such farms need an initial dose of state help. This fact has been clearly brought out in the study area. The farms benefiting from past conservation programme of the state government have done better than those who were deprived of it. The former group of farms has been able to lease-in better piece of land and take cash crop to raise their profit level. This has positively affected their investment decisions. While land tenure has shown weak relation with decision of farm investment, farmers’ credit worthiness might play a greater role in helping adoption of conservation on farm. Thus, financial inclusion of these <b>marginal</b> <b>farms</b> could be an important incentive policy variable for adoption of conservation measures in this region.

The average installation cost on a tubewell has been found highest on large size of holdings (Rs 33, 130), followed by medium (Rs 27, 240), small (Rs 23, 850), and marginal (Rs 19, 610) holdings. The capital budgeting techniques, viz. net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (B:C ratio) and internal rate of return (IRR) have been used for evaluating the investment on tubewells. The NPV has been found positive (Rs 1440) and B:C ratio more than one (1. 05 : 1). The IRR has been estimated to be more than the capital cost (10. 95 %). But, the tubewells have failed to generate income flow equal to the investment by <b>marginal</b> <b>farms.</b> Farm size-wise analysis has revealed that the owner-seller farms category predominates in the water market in the study area.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the main findings of vulnerable group profiling work in Nepal. It identifies the characteristics and investigates the vulnerability for seven particular livelihood groups, notably <b>marginal</b> <b>farm</b> {{households in the}} Terai, in the hills and in the mountains, agricultural labour households in the Terai, porters in the hills and mountains, rural service castes, and poor urban workers in the informal economy in the Kathmandu Valley. Based on this analysis, it considers how these people cope during times of insufficient food production and/or earnings, and proposes actions that could be taken to reduce their vulnerability to becoming food insecure in the future. Most {{of the research on}} poverty in Nepal during the past decades has focused exclusively on determining the poverty line and calculating the proportion of people living under this line, rather than unmasking the characteristics, particularly the locational aspects, of poverty other than the rural and urban distribution (Sadeque, 1998). This report therefore contributes to new knowledge by identifying and characterising particular vulnerable groups of people in broad geographic areas based on their livelihoods. The knowledge and insights gained through this process is intended to complement existing assessments at the household/community and national level, and to help bridge the gap between local knowledge and national level decision-making. It is hoped that this study will draw attention to the need for greater policy and programme support to food security in Nepal. In this context, the findings could inform the design of a food security policy (as recommended in the UN progress report on implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in Nepal), as well as the development and strengthening of other policies and programmes that reduce vulnerability and increase food security for a larger share of the population in the country. In particular, it could be useful in supporting implementation of the Government’s recently formulated Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which received cabinet endorsement in May 2003.

40|$|In India, {{economic}} growth has improved significantly {{during the past}} two and a half decades, particularly in the post-reform period. India is considered as {{one of the fastest growing}} economies in the world. However, the exclusion problems have not been addressed seriously by the government programmes and strategies. The experience of the economic reforms during the past 15 years indicates that while there have been improvements in the {{economic growth}}, foreign exchange, IT revolution, export growth, etc., the income distribution has been unequal and only some sections of the population have been benefited more from this higher growth and prosperity. In other words, real development in terms of growth shared by all sections of the population has not taken place. We have problems of poverty, unemployment, inequalities in access to credit, health care and education and poor performance of the agriculture sector. One of the excluded sectors during the reform period was agriculture which showed low growth and experienced more farmers’ suicides. There are serious concerns about the performance of agriculture sector in the country. The post-reform period growth has been led by the services. The commodity sector growth (agriculture + industry) has not been higher in the post-reform period as compared to that during the 1980 s. The particular worry is the agriculture sector which has shown less than 2 per cent per annum growth during the past decade. Also, there is a disconnect between employment growth and GDP growth. In other words, employment is not being generated in the industry and services sector, where growth is high. On the other hand, GDP growth is low in the agriculture wherein a majority of people are employed. Thus, there has been a lop-sided approach to agricultural development in India during the past few decades. Growth may be higher {{during the past two}} decades, but the inclusive growth in terms of focus on agriculture has been missing 1. It is like running a train with engine only without connecting a majority of the bogies and people to the engine. The role of agriculture in economic development is well known. Agriculture not only contributes to overall growth of the economy but also provides employment and food security to the majority population, which in turn reduces poverty in a developing country. Thus, if we want pro-poor growth and real development, high agricultural growth and rising incomes for farmers are essential. In recent decades, the context within which agriculture policy has to be developed and implemented, has undergone fundamental changes. The relationships operated for much of the 1960 s and 1970 s have changed. Globalization policies during the 1980 s and particularly during 1990 s and beyond have created many challenges for agriculture in developing countries. Some of the consequences and impacts of globalization in developing countries are: exposure of domestic agriculture to international competition, growth of non-agricultural sector and its impact on demand for agricultural products, urban middle class life-style changes, including diets, rising food imports, competitiveness and diversification of domestic production systems, vertical integration of the food supply chain, etc. (Prabhu, 2006). Because of demographic pressures, there has been a significant increase in small and <b>marginal</b> <b>farm</b> holdings. These farmers have to face the challenges of globalization. Risk and uncertainty have also increased as cultivation has spread to marginal lands. The diversification of agriculture has also raised concerns on food security. In recent years, there has been a concern regarding increase in the global food prices. Rise in crude oil prices has increased agricultural costs also. Increased use of food crops for biofuels has also pushed up their demand. The USA uses 20 per cent of its maize production for biofuels; Brazil uses 50 per cent of sugarcane for biofuels; and the European Union uses 68 per cent of its vegetable oil production for biofuels. Such large usages, by reducing the availability of these products for food and feed, have exerted pressure on their prices. Food prices have also increased due to low output stocks. International prices of wheat, rice and maize have increased significantly in the past two years. This is another challenge for India in maintaining its food security. This lecture is divided into three sections. Section 1 deals with the performance and problems of agriculture, while Section 2 discusses policy challenges for the revival of Indian agriculture.

40|$|SummaryMany {{parts of}} the world are {{suffering}} from environmental problems such as deforestation. Many papers described the causes and consequences of deforestation but very little information is available on mechanisms and effective policy measures that slow down deforestation rates. The motivation behind this PhD-research research was the hope that {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms would help policy makers take the appropriate actions to stimulate forest transitions. The northern Ethiopian highlands were selected as a case study because evidence was available that at least in some local, possibly isolated cases, regreening was observed during the last decades. This research addressed 3 main questions: (1) what are the regional trends of land use and land cover change that took place in the northern Ethiopian highlands? (2) Can the observed land use and land cover change be linked with socio-economic, demographic, political or environmental factors? (3) Is it possible to outline optimal land use patterns that minimize future land degradation and maximize production and profitability?Detection of differential greening is, therefore, premeditated under chapter 2. This chapter presents a methodology to evaluate land cover changes on the basis of NDVI time-series derived from NOAA_AVHRR and SPOT vegetation sensors. The results show that the aggregated greenness in Tigray has declined between 1982 and 2010. On the basis of interpolated rainfall data, it was tried to disentangle the effect of fluctuations in preceding rainfall and human impact on the landscape greening. From 2000 onwards the degreening trend was slowed down and in some cases even reversed, which could partially be attributed to land abandonment on completely degraded land and the relative success of soil conservation measures. To evaluate the link between observed land use and land cover change and the socio-economic, demographic, political or environmental factors, a detailed study was carried out in 5 rural villages (chapter 3) and the Dessaa forest (chapter 4) for 3 different time-frames: 1965, 1994 and 2007. The maps were based on the interpretation of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery in combination with field validation. The results from rural villages showed a strong decrease of the forest and bush land in favor of arable land and rangeland from 1965 till 1994. This trend was, however, slowed down and even reversed from 1994 onwards whereby some of the arable land and rangeland is abandoned allowing shrubs and bushes to regenerate. However, household interviews and census data showed that the rural population number was still increasing while the productivity of the farming activities did not show a significant increase. The observed abandonment of <b>marginal</b> <b>farm</b> and rangeland was, therefore, only made possible through food aid and the import of food from other regions. The results from the Dessaa forest also showed that the forest cover of the area has decreased. While the area ofarable land and built-up surfaces have increased during these years. Population pressure was the most influential factor for the decline in forest cover in the study villages. Distance to built-up surfaces, distance to main roads and rivers, variation in slope, elevation and aspect were significant variables on forest degradation on major part of the study area. Changes in forest policies, have also contributed to the decline in forest cover. The extent to which land use patterns can be optimized to minimize further land degradation and to maximize the incomes generated from farming was examined (chapter 5) in the catchment of the Geba River. An ordinal classification of soil erosion rates and profitability assessments were put in a spatial decision support system in order to generate optimal land use patterns. The profit maximisation scenario showed that in order to generate higher profits, the landscape must be organised in a sort of Von Thünen landscape with concentric rings surrounding the market places. The erosion minimization scenario showed that a concentration of all the arable land in the less erodible places would reduce the average soil erosion rate. The mixed scenarios in which reduction of erosion and increase of profitability were both taken into account showed that the definition of the weights of the performance indicators is of crucial importance. If the generation of total profits is emphasized, the corresponding land use pattern would consist of even more arable land than the present day situation. If soil conservation received more weight the optimal landscape would consist of less arable land but with a higher area-specific profitability. nrpages: 217 status: publishe...|$|E

Its population increased after the first and second World Wars due to the government's policies of subsidies to encourage settlement by veterans. The people of Rainbow have struggled to eke out an existence for more than three generations, with global economics and government policy compounding the difficulties of <b>marginal</b> <b>farming.</b> The film draws from home movies from the 1940s to portray the people in this town.|$|R
