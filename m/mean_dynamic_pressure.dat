40|$|Abstract: In the paper, the {{stability}} of a plunge pool bottom under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, {{with reference to the}} mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity. In cases when the mean components are relevant in respect to the fluctuating ones, this analysis is exhausting. In other cases, a separate evaluation of the fluctuation effects in lining design is treated by means of experimental evidence. The <b>mean</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> at the bottom depends strongly on the impingement angle, which assumes a relevant role in the design of floor protections. In plunge pools, which are confined upstream by the presence of the drop structure, the impingement angle is theoretically determined by mass balance and momentum conservation, resulting independent of the jet entrance angle at the plunge pool water surface. The theoretical results are compared with literature, experimental evidence, and numerical simulations. This highlights the capability of the proposed theoretical framework to correctly interpret the physical phenomena and to produce suitable engineering approaches in plunge pool bottom lining design...|$|E

The rate of dispersion depends on the geometric characteristics of the porous structure and speed of the fl uid. Generally, groundwater systems have layered structures determined by different events in the geological processes that formed them. The layers in a system have di erent physical properties, and their thicknesses are not uniform. This naturally layered structure is used here to advantage by discretizing them into almost horizontal layers, where each may have different geometrical characteristics such as thickness permeability, dispersivitiy, porosity, etc. The system of advection-dispersion equations that model the uid and species transport then have coeffcients that depend mainly on depth, but with a layer composition that may change with horizontal distance.

The heliospheric termination shock is expected to move in response to variation in upstream solar wind conditions, so that at any particular instant the termination shock will resemble a distorted asymmetric balloon with some parts moving inward and others moving outward. If the shock is a gasdynamic or magnetohydrodynamic shock the results of the analysis depend only very weakly {{on the nature of the}} upstream disturbance; typical speeds of the disturbed shock are approximately 100 to 200 km/s. In the absence of a significant latitude gradient of the typical magnitude of solar wind disturbances typical motions of the disturbed shock at polar latitudes would be about twice as fast, due to the higher speed of the high-latitude wind. If the dynamics of the termination shock are dominated by acceleration of the anomalous component of the cosmic rays, the motion of the shock in response to a given disturbance is substantially slower than in the gasdynamic case. Conceivably, particle acceleration might be a less important effect at higher latitudes, and we envision the possibility of a termination shock that is dominated by particle acceleration at lower latitudes and is an MHD shock at high latitudes. In this event high latitude solar wind disturbances would produce substantially larger inward and outward motions of the shock in the polar regions...|$|E

This component {{plays an important role in}} the passive system for the residual heat decay removal foreseen in the MARS reactor and in the GCFR of the Generation IV reactors. The sensitivity analysis has investigated: 1) the heat exchanger arrangement; two different arrangements have been considered: a horizontal arrangement, in which a system of electrical heaters are placed at the inlet cross section of the tower, and a vertical arrangement, with the heaters distributed vertically around the circumference of the tower. 2) The shape of the cooling tower; by varying the angle of the shell inclination it is possible to obtain a different shape for the tower itself. An upper and a lower angle inclination were modified and by a calculation procedure eleven different configuration were selected. 3) The effect of cross wind on the tower performance. An equation-based procedure to design the dry-cooling tower is presented. In order to evaluate the influence of the shape and the heat exchanger arrangement on the performance of the cooling tower, a geometrical factor (FG) and a thermal factor (FT) are introduced. By analyzing the experimental results, engineering design relations are obtained to model the cooling tower performance. The comparison between the experimental heat transfer coefficient and the heat transfer coefficient obtained by the mathematical procedure shows that there is a good agreement. The influence of wind has been investigated on selected configurations and it has been studied by introducing several coefficients for the comparison: a wind effect and a pressure coefficients were used to evaluate the effect at the throat; a power coefficient, a mean static and <b>mean</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficients were also defined in order to compare the influence of the wind on different configurations.

40|$|The {{stability}} of slab protection {{at the bottom}} of spillway stilling basins or plunge pools downstream of large dams came to the great practical interest when the protection under the hydraulic jump stilling basins in some hydraulic plants was seriously damaged by floods smaller than maximum design value. This thesis offers novel practical design criteria to define the concrete thickness of spillway stilling basins and plunge pools lining. In the case of spillway stilling basins, the study presents a new experimental procedure that can define the global instantaneous uplift force. Results from detailed experiments of the statistical structure of turbulence pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} hydraulic jumps is reported. Here, the whole spatial correlation structure of the fluctuating pressure field is required in order to evaluate slab stability. This is computed via simultaneous acquisition of the point pressure fluctuations on a dense grid in the hydraulic jump region, requiring a severe experimental work. As an alternative, one can evaluate the pressure spatial correlation structure via auto-correlation using one point pressure acquisition and applying the Taylor hypothesis. To adopt the Taylor hypothesis, one must know the pressure propagation celerity in space that can be obtained by comparing the whole spatial pressure correlation with the pivot point pressure auto-correlation. The experiments were performed by simultaneous pressure acquisitions {{at the bottom of a}} hydraulic jump for Froude numbers of the incident flow ranging from 4. 9 to 10. 3. From experiments, a criterion to define the pressure celerity as a function of the incident flow velocity is presented. The results highlight a good agreement between the relevant pressure statistical parameters as measured and the ones computed using the Taylor hypothesis. The comparison between the slab thicknesses, as computed via Taylor hypothesis, with the ones retrievable in literature, as obtained by direct force measurement on instrumented slabs in laboratory conditions, highlights the accuracy of the proposed approach that presents undeniable practical advantages. While this simplified approach based on Taylor hypothesis is used to assess the pressure field acting on the slab, the pressure propagation at the lower surface of the slab is evaluated using a 3 D model based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media. By this approach, it is possible to consider the effect of finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the case of earth dams, rock-fill dams and in other dam types. Slabs with unsealed joints are considered and compared to the case of sealed joints. The dynamic behavior of anchored slabs is also investigated. These results are relevant to a robust and safe design and maintenance of stilling basins downstream of large dams. In the case of plunge pools, the {{stability of}} concrete slabs or rock blocks under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, with reference to the mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity.

Although the <b>mean</b> static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>mean</b> peak <b>pressure</b> data were not significantly lower in the vertical bra strap orientation compared to the cross-back orientation, participants consistently reported that the vertical orientation did not ‘dig in’ or ‘create pressure or tension on the trapezius muscle’ compared to the cross-back orientation. It is possible that this between-strap orientation difference in perception of pressure, despite the lack of any quantitative difference in strap pressure, may be due to variations in the anatomical structures at the strap/pressure sensor interface. That is, in the vertical orientation, the strap lays across the bone, which is better designed to tolerate compressive forces relative to the muscle tissue at the cross-back orientation strap/pressure sensor interface (upper trapezius muscle) [28].
