5|$|Bogin {{observes that}} Thompson {{originated}} {{the use of}} transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but that without modern computers the <b>method</b> <b>was</b> tedious to apply and was not often used.

5|$|John Scott Haldane was {{commissioned}} by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure.

5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His <b>method</b> <b>was</b> then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E

5|$|Thorium oxide was {{discovered}} by Friedrich Wöhler in the mineral, which was found in Norway (1827). Jöns Jacob Berzelius characterized this material in more detail by in 1828. By reduction of thorium tetrachloride with potassium, he isolated the metal and named it thorium after the Norse god of thunder and lightning Thor. The same isolation <b>method</b> <b>was</b> later used by Péligot for uranium.|$|E

40|$|A <b>method</b> <b>is</b> {{given to}} compute the {{spurious}} endpoint contributions in the physical optics solution for electromagnetic scattering from conducting bodies. The <b>method</b> <b>is</b> applicable to general three-dimensional structures. The only information required to use the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> the radius of curvature of the body at the shadow boundary. Thus, the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> very efficient for numerical computations. As an illustration, the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> applied to several bodies of revolution {{to compute the}} endpoint contributions for backscattering {{in the case of}} axial incidence.

40|$|Abstract. There <b>are</b> several <b>methods</b> to {{estimate}} fractal dimension in fractional Brownian motion model. In this paper, one of methods, the variance <b>method,</b> <b>is</b> analyzed detailedly, and some {{problems in the}} <b>method</b> <b>are</b> pointed out. To resolve the problems, an improved <b>method</b> <b>is</b> proposed. To validate the method, a comparing experiment of two <b>methods</b> <b>is</b> designed. In the experiment, a SPOT image is selected and five categories, flourishing field, bareness land, resident area, water area and mountainous area, in the image are taken as examples. The experiment shows that the result by improved <b>method</b> <b>is</b> coincident with human perception and the improved <b>method</b> <b>is</b> also helpful for classification...|$|R
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} <b>method</b> <b>was</b> cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this <b>method</b> <b>was</b> tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic <b>method</b> <b>was</b> more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent.|$|E
