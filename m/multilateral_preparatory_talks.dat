40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the importance of communication that occurs just before workplace meetings (i. e. pre-meeting talk). The paper explores how four specific types of pre-meeting talk (small talk, work <b>talk,</b> meeting <b>preparatory</b> <b>talk,</b> and shop talk) impact participants’ experiences of meeting effectiveness. Moreover, the authors investigate the role of participants’ personality in the link between pre-meeting talk and perceived meeting effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Motivational Interviewing is an {{effective}} treatment {{for a range of}} problematic behaviours. However, previous studies have revealed substantial variability in the effectiveness of clinicians. Curiously, the specific clinician behaviours which contribute to positive outcomes have rarely been studied. Previous studies have often focused on the impact of broad categories of clinician behaviour on outcomes; such outcomes have often been overt client behaviours. The current study represented a substantial shift from the dominant methodologies in the MI literature. It aimed to study the effect specific clinician behaviours had upon client’s <b>preparatory</b> <b>talk</b> and strong commitment talk, in the second-to-second interactions between clinicians and clients. A secondary analysis of Motivational Enhancement Therapy sessions was conducted, using recordings obtained during the United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT). Recordings were sampled from those clients who achieved and maintained positive changes in readiness to change following the UKATT study. Recordings were parsed and coded, with data being subjected to sequential and regression analyses. The findings revealed that clinicians’ complex reflections were associated with, and predictive of, significantly more strong commitments from clients. Open questions and complex reflections were both associated with significantly more <b>preparatory</b> <b>talk.</b> However, only complex reflections acted as a significant predictor of <b>preparatory</b> <b>talk.</b> It is concluded that complex reflections and open questions are necessary for the proficient practice of MI, and that clinicians should tailor their approach to match their client’s current motivational state. Moreover, the effectiveness of MI is likely attributable to a combination of the ‘spirit’ of MI and the proficient use of such skills, and possibly other specific skills. It is proposed that future research into MI and other psychological therapies should investigate the role of complex reflections, open questions and other specific clinician behaviours on client outcomes of interest...|$|R

40|$|On 23 January 2014, a {{group of}} 73 member states’ {{officials}} and representatives from the European institutions and academia gathered at Clingendael Park in The Hague for a day-long seminar co-organised by the Netherlands Institute of International Relations and CEPS for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. The seminar’s aim was to discuss whether subsidiarity can offer a way forward that reconciles the need for better EU governance with concerns about legitimacy. This paper is based on subsidiarity literature, on <b>preparatory</b> <b>talks</b> with officials from member states and EU institutions and on the discussions in the seminar in The Hague. In particular, the paper explores the political and practical relevance {{of some of the}} ideas currently being considered to solidify the principle of subsidiarity in day-to-day decision-making.

40|$|<b>Preparatory</b> <b>talks</b> to {{the next}} round of {{negotiations}} seem to indicate that a comprehensive agreement tomitigate climate change will not be easily attainable, despite the intentions of the US administration and the high expectations surrounding the Copenhagen meeting. One key reason is to what extent fast growing economies, and especially China, should take actions to reduce their growth of emissions. This paper argues that a turning point for international negotiations on climate change could be achieved if China were to agree on carbon obligations in the future. Results from modelling work suggest that the optimal investment behaviour is to anticipate the implementation of a climate policy by roughly 10 years, and that thus future commitments—if credible—could lead to significantly earlier steps towards carbon mitigation. If fast growing economies, and foremost China, believe in the long term objective of global stabilization of carbon concentrations, it might be economically rationale to sign on future targets, provided developed countries take on immediate action. Such a provision could be beneficial for both the developing and developed world...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{workshop}} is {{to discuss}} some recent results on the classification/structure of foliations on projective varieties having effective anti-canonical bundle. Two main classes of foliations {{are going to be}} discussed. 1. 1. Fano foliations. These are the foliations with ample anti-canonical bundle. They have been investigated by Araujo and Druel in a series of papers ([2], [4], [1], [3]). 1. 2. Foliations with trivial canonical class. These are the foliations with numerically trivial canonical bundle. Most of the results so far have focused on codimension one folia-tions. The smooth case has been investigated by Touzet [29] and the general case by Loray, Pereira and Touzet [21]. 2. PREPARATORY TALKS We suggest the following topics for the <b>preparatory</b> <b>talks.</b> 2. 1. Classification of low degree foliations on projective spaces (one talk). The idea would be to cover the classification of foliations of low degree on projective spaces ob-tained by Jouanolou and Cerveau-Lins Neto. 2. 2.

5000|$|On 27 February 2009, the United States {{announced}} it would boycott the conference. The American delegation in attendance at the conference's <b>preparatory</b> <b>talks</b> concluded that [...] "the anti-Israel and anti-Western tendencies were too deeply entrenched to excise." [...] The US State Department said the planned outcome document being drafted for the meeting had [...] "gone from bad to worse, and the current text... is not salvageable... A conference based on this text would be a missed opportunity to speak clearly about the persistent problem of racism." [...] However, {{in an interview on}} 4 April, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice expressed her feeling that the content of the latest draft had improved and that a decision on the United States' involvement in the conference had not been made. Deliberation inside the Obama administration ended on 18 April: [...] "With regret, the United States will not join the review conference," [...] said State Department spokesman Robert Wood. Wood said the conference document reaffirmed a declaration that emerged from the original Durban conference which the United States had opposed, and that the United States was concerned over new additions to the text regarding [...] "incitement," [...] that run counter to the U.S. commitment to unfettered free speech. The following day, President Barack Obama said [...] "I would love to be involved in a useful conference that addressed continuing issues of racism and discrimination around the globe," [...] but stressed that the language of the U.N.'s draft declaration [...] "raised a whole set of objectionable provisions" [...] and risked a reprise Durban, [...] "which became a session through which folks expressed antagonism toward Israel in ways that were often times completely hypocritical and counterproductive." [...] The United States had withdrawn from the 2001 Durban Conference, and did not attend the 1978 and 1985 World Conferences Against Racism.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the present thesis was to evaluate the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) {{in the treatment of}} gambling disorder including comparisons with a no treatment control group. Secondary analyses aimed at investigating the treatments relative sensitivity to contemporary alcohol problems, as well as investigating processes in MI. A total of 150 problem gamblers according to NORC DSM-IV screen for gambling problems were randomized to MI, CBGT, or a no-treatment control. MI and CBGT combined in one single treatment arm (participants receiving either MI or CBGT) showed better treatment outcomes than the no-treatment control at post treatment. However, supplementary analyses that only included participants with severe gambling problems (gambling disorder) reviled that the no treatment control showed marginally better outcomes than CBGT and significantly better outcomes than MI. A secondary analysis was conducted aiming to investigate whether screening for risky alcohol habits can provide guidance on whether people with gambling disorder should be recommended MI or CBGT. The interaction between treatment and alcohol habits was significant and suggests that patients with gambling disorder and risky alcohol habits were better helped by MI, while those without risky alcohol habits were better helped by CBGT. An additional secondary analysis was conducted with the purpose to test hypothesized relationships among process and outcome variables in the MI theory, in a context of gambling disorder treatment. The Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code was used to assess therapists’ verbal behaviors during MI sessions and the Client Language Assessment in Motivational Interviewing was used to assess clients’ verbal behaviors. As hypothesized, high scores on empathy reduced symptoms of gambling disorder at six-month follow-up. High scores on MI spirit increased the frequency of <b>preparatory</b> change <b>talk,</b> which in turn increased the probability of commitments occurring. Unexpectedly, MI adherent utterances decreased the frequency of <b>preparatory</b> change <b>talk.</b> No indirect effects were found to confirm that client language mediated the relation between therapist skills in MI and treatment outcome. Main conclusions: MI treatment including a significant proportion of sessions lacking competent use of MI adherent methods, evoking skills and autonomy support might be harmful for people with gambling disorder who voluntarily sign up to treatment after an assessment interview. Patients with gambling disorder and risky alcohol habits {{are more likely to be}} helped if they are referred to MI treatment compared to CBGT, while those without risky alcohol habits are likely to be best helped if they are referred to CBGT. Therapists’ skills in demonstrating empathy seems to be a promising therapeutic component linked to successful treatment outcomes when treating gambling disorder...|$|R
6000|$|It was to prove, however, on the morrow, quite {{consistent}} {{with the spirit of}} these words that, the party at Matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing, {{he should be able to}} meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind. It was impossible, for reasons, that he should travel to town with the Assinghams; it was impossible, for the same reasons, that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twenty-four hours been privately, and it might have been said profoundly, thinking out. The result of his thought was already precious to him, and this put at his service, he sufficiently believed, the right tone for disposing of his elder friend's suggestion, an assumption in fact equally full and mild, that he and Charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the Colonel and herself. The extension of the idea to Mrs. Verver had been, precisely, a part of Mrs. Assingham's mildness, and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from Portland Place and the lady from Eaton Square might now confess, quite without indiscretion, to simultaneity of movement. She had made, for the four days, no direct appeal to the latter personage, but the Prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay. There had been, at this climax, the usual <b>preparatory</b> <b>talk</b> about hours and combinations, in the midst of which poor Fanny gently approached Mrs. Verver. She said [...] "You and the Prince, love,"--quite, apparently, without blinking; she took for granted their public withdrawal together; she remarked that she and Bob were alike ready, in the interest of sociability, to take any train that would make them all one party. [...] "I feel really as if, all this time, I had seen nothing of you"--that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear thing's approach. But just then it was, on the other hand, that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred. His preference had, during the evening, not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences; practically without words, without any sort of straight telegraphy, it had arrived at a felt identity with Charlotte's own. She spoke all for their friend while she answered their friend's question, but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window. [...] "It's awfully sweet of you, darling--our going together would be charming. But you mustn't mind us--you must suit yourselves we've settled, Amerigo and I, to stay over till after luncheon." ...|$|R
