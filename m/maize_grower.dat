40|$|The European Union's {{decision}} to introduce labelling thresholds for the adventitious presence {{of genetically modified}} (GM) material in non-GM products, necessary to safeguard consumer choice, {{paved the way for}} a regulated coexistence between GM and non-GM crops. The potential economic impact of ensuring this coexistence through agronomic or organisational measures can occur at the level of individual farms. Based on survey data from 402 commercial Spanish farmers, this paper calculates the economic gains attributed to the adoption of Bt maize during 2002 - 2004. In this period there was no mandatory implementation of measures to ensure coexistence, since these were still under discussion by regulators.

40|$|ABSTRACT Inefficiency {{in the use}} of {{available}} scarce resources has been the bane on increased food production hence low income among the cream of farmers across the nation. The study examined resource use efficiency (with water as the key variable) in irrigated maize production in the Northern part of Taraba State. The study revealed that water was over-utilized in irrigated maize production in the area of study since it had an MVP of less than unity. Multi-stage stratified random and purposive random sampling techniques involving six wards and eighteen villages were used to select respondents. One hundred and twenty (120) questionnaires were administered on one hundred (120) irrigated <b>maize</b> <b>growers.</b> Only one hundred and seventeen (117) of the questionnaires were retrieved for analysis. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, gross margin and net farm income analyses and production functions. Data were fitted to four functional forms based on the OLS techniques. The Cobb-Douglas (power function) production function gave the best fit. All the co-efficients except those of agro-chemical and education carried the expected positive signs. The specific objectives of the study were to determine resource use efficiency, describe socio-economic characteristics of irrigated <b>maize</b> <b>growers,</b> estimate cost and returns and identify constraints to irrigated maize production among respondents. The study revealed the cost and returns per hectare as N 55, 152. 61 and N 105, 937. 50 respectively.

40|$|Brazil {{has been}} an {{important}} producer of corn (Zea mays) for the greengrocery market, and canned corn grain has long been sold in the national market. Currently, there have been few agri-industries canning sweet corn (Zea mays) because few commercial varieties with agronomic characteristics proper to attend industrial purposes are available to specialty <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> (Gama et al., 1992). In the different types of corn, the content of proteins varies from 6 to 12 % (dry basis), and 75 % of these proteins are stored in the endosperm (FAO, 2008). The nutritive value of canned sweet corn is also high (Pereira Filho & Cruz, 2002; Oliveira Junior et al., 2006) because the reduction in polysaccharides as the starch, for example, increases the content of proteins (Paes, 2006). In the milky stage, the grains are tender and the concentration of sugars is higher than found in the immature grain of common corn (Silva, 1994). Hybrid grains whether stored under appropriate environmental conditions have their life span extended. This allows net returns to the specialty <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> and nutritional benefits to consumers (Braz et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2009). In sweet corn, carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose and starch define the produce quality and should be also investigated to recommend novelty cultivars with better consumer acceptance (Caniato et al., 2004). The sweet corn differs from the common corn because of the high sugar and low starch contents controlled by single recessive genes or genes associated with double or triple combinations (Araujo et al., 2001). A genetic program of sweet corn have to consider the grain quality, the agronomic characteristics of commercial traits such as the dehusked ear yield, and the stability and combining ability (Teixeira et al. 2009).

Conventional tillage and no-till treatments had no significant effect on the incidence of fumonisins.

We estimate regression models to test the relationship between hybrid seed use and four indicators of dietary diversity: food group diversity (24 -hour), vitamin A diversity (7 -day), food frequency (7 -day), and frequency of consuming foods fortified with vitamin A (7 -day). We find that, according to the first three indicators, women in maize-growing households that plant hybrid seed have more diverse diets. Findings are weak when we consider the frequency of consuming foods fortified with vitamin A, highlighting the importance of testing multiple indicators. Results suggest that in Zambia, families of smallholder maize farmers who do not grow hybrid seed are likely to be a disadvantaged group, with respect to maize productivity and other diet-related welfare indicators.

40|$|The current {{nitrogen}} (N) use in {{silage maize}} production {{can lead to}} considerable N losses to the environment. <b>Maize</b> <b>growers</b> fear that a reduction of N inputs needed to minimize N losses might depress yields. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to quantify: (1) the response of silage maize dry matter (DM) yields to N, (2) the economically optimal N reserve, and (3) the trade-off between silage maize DM yield and N losses. The indicators of N losses used in this study were the difference between N input and N uptake and the post-harvest residual soil mineral N. Regression models were used to fit DM yields and N uptakes of silage maize measured in 25 experiments on sandy soils in the Netherlands to the sum (SUMN) of the soil mineral N reserve (SMNearly) in March–April, plus mineral N in fertilizer, plus ammonium N in spring-applied slurry. The values obtained for the economically optimal SUMN in the upper 30 and 60 cm of soil were, respectively, 173 and 195 kg N ha− 1, when we assumed that the value of 1 kg fertilizer N equals the value of 5 kg silage DM. The economically optimal SUMN was not significantly related to the attainable DM yield. The apparent N recovery (ANR) of maize averaged 53 % at the economically optimal SUMN. The ANR rose considerably, however, when N was applied at lower rates, indicating that N losses may be considerably smaller in less intensive maize cropping. When maize was fertilized at 100 kg N ha− 1 below the economic optimum, the ANR was 73 %, the difference between the mineral N input and the N crop uptake decreased by 57 kg N ha− 1 and the soil mineral N residue {{at the end of the}} growing season (0 – 60 cm) decreased by 24 kg N ha− 1. The associated reduction in DM yield averaged 16 %. Fertilizer prices would have to be as much as four times higher to make <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> spontaneously reduce the application rates by a 100 kg N ha− 1, however. It is concluded that adjusting the N input to a level below the economically optimal rate can reduce the risks for N losses to the environment associated with conventional maize production, with a limited effect on silage yields...|$|R

40|$|Inclusive {{business}} models combine profitability {{with the potential}} for poverty reduction by linking smallholders with markets. This report analyses three {{business models}} relevant for sorghum and millets in east and southern Africa. These are: The Warehouse Receipt System operated by Lesiolo Grain Handlers Limited (LGHL) (Kenya), the contract sorghum grower model operated by Smart Logistics Solutions Ltd (SLS) (Kenya), and the contract finger millet grower system operated by the LEAD Project (Uganda). The performance of these business models was evaluated in terms of their design, profitability, and inclusiveness. The WRS is a producer-driven model that depends on the willingness and ability of producers to store grain until prices rise. The case-study of the WRS operated by LGHL showed low uptake by <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> due to constraints imposed by low awareness among growers, a minimum 10 t threshold of grain accepted for storage, and the distance to the store. In 2011, only 600 t of maize entered the WRS from five farmer groups. Although the WRS was profitable for <b>maize</b> <b>growers,</b> the seasonal rise in prices was much lower for sorghum and millets, which greatly reduced the potential benefits of WRS for these crops. A recent survey of participants showed that the WRS was inclusive, with high rates of participation from small maize producers and from women. The Smart Logistics business model is a buyer-driven model driven by the growing market for clear sorghum beer. Smart Logistics acts as an intermediary for the brewery industry, supplying seed to producer groups, monitoring quality, and offering higher prices than local brokers. The model is profitable for growers, intermediary, and buyer. Volumes supplied to the industry have grown but are still not sufficient to meet demand. The model is inclusive with the majority of producers belonging to all-female groups, and collective farming to reduce unit costs. Of the three models studied, this has the greatest potential. The LEAD business model was designed to provide Unga Millers Ltd in Nairobi with an annual supply of 6, 000 t of finger millet. However, the model proved unworkable. No finger millet was ever delivered. The business model was profitable for Ugandan growers and for the buyer. The model was also inclusive, with finger millet supplied smallholders organized in producer organizations, where almost half the members were women. However, the model failed because it was intermediary-driven. Changes to the original design by the LEAD management team delayed the start of the project while the small company appointed to bulk, clean, and ship finger millet to Nairobi was unfit for this role...|$|R

Here we show that a mixed planting of 5 % nonBt and 95 % Bt maize containing the SmartStax traits expressing Cry 1 A. 105, Cry 2 Ab 2 and Cry 1 F did not provide an effective refuge for an important above-ground ear-feeding pest, the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). Cross-pollination in RIB caused a majority (> 90 %) of refuge kernels to express ≥ one Bt protein.

A total of 110 <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> including 86 adopters and 24 non adopters of hybrid maize varieties (adopters of open pollinated maize varieties) were interviewed {{with the help of}} structured questionnaire.

The total contribution of intervening variables to the variation of adoption behaviour is as much as 93 percent, which far exceeds that of the independent variables contributing only 6 percent. This supports the assumption that the intervening variables are the direct precursors of adoption behaviour and that the influence of independent variable becomes manifested in adoption behaviour via the intervening variables. From this emerge exciting possibilities for behaviour interventions of development programmes, but more research is necessary to verify the findings in different countries and cultures and to refine the selection of the most relevant intervening variables...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) {{white and}} yellow maize, Zea mays, has been commercially released and cultivated in South Africa since 1997 / 1998. The traits expressed are insect resistance and herbicide tolerance conferred by the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry genes and Agrobacterium 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate (EPSP) synthase gene, respectively. The Cry genes {{have been used}} widely to control lepidopteran insect pests but insect resistance to GM Bt crops has been a concern since the introduction of this technology. A management strategy includes refugia planting of 5 % non-Bt plants, with no insecticide application, and 20 %, where insecticide application is allowed. These refugia are designed to allow the survival of insect pests within restricted planted zones. However, in South Africa {{there are reports of}} Bt-resistant stem borer (Busseola fusca) (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and non-compliance with refuge planting. The aims of this study were two-fold: 1. To conduct a survey among KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) GM <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> to ascertain information such as level of compliance with refuge planting and to determine which refugia were predominantly planted and reasons thereof; 2. To conduct a replicated field trial to determine yield, insect borer damage and economic benefit of the 5 % unsprayed and 20 % sprayed refuge options (including three configurations namely strip, perimeter and block and a 5 and 20 % ‘refuge-in-a-bag’ option). The survey indicated that 28 out of 29 (96. 6 %) KZN Bt <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> plant the 5 % non-sprayed refuge with 27 (96. 4 %) of those respondents planting the strip configuration for the purpose of insect management (75 %) and ease of planting (32. 2 %). The survey also showed that 7 (seven) i. e. 21. 9 % of KZN Bt <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> observed borer damage and although growers are now fully compliant with refugia planting requirements, initially 7 respondents (24. 1 %) did not comply with or plant refugia correctly. Furthermore, 7 respondents reported insect borer damage in their maize with 4 of the 7 instances (57. 1 %) likely stemming from incorrectly planted refugia. vii No significant differences in yield or insect damage were observed between the 5 and 20 % refugia for any of the planting configurations in the field trial. However due to costs involved with insecticide application and labour required for the operation in the 20 % option, these treatments were less economically advantageous than the non-Bt control. The 20 % block and strip configurations had a cost benefit ratio of ZAR 7. 21 and ZAR 6. 67 respectively, earned per R 1 spent by the grower compared with ZAR 7. 76 in the sprayed control. The cost-benefit comparison for the 5 % block and strip configurations was ZAR 8. 48 and ZAR 7. 71, respectively compared with ZAR 9. 44 in the unsprayed control. In addition, the 20 % seed mixture limited borer damage to 4. 95 % when compared with 15. 77 % damage in the sprayed control (ANOVA, F pr = 0. 124). The seed mixtures are not available commercially and the results from the survey indicated that some education and marketing by the seed companies would be advisable prior to their release to the farming community. In order to determine which of the refuge options between 5 and 20 % would be more advantageous for growers overall, regardless of the planting configuration; data were grouped and analysed. There {{were no significant differences in}} either the yield or insect damage for the 5 and 20 % refugia, but the cost-benefit calculations indicated that the 5 % option was more cost effective – for the 5 and 20 % refugia, ZAR 7. 97 and ZAR 7. 15 respectively, earned per ZAR 1 spent by the grower (ANOVA, F pr. = 0. 03). This is because no insecticide was used in the 5 % treatments. Mean ear damage comparisons between the 5 and 20 % refugia showed that the 20 % refuge in the perimeter configuration incurred the least damage (2. 65 % ear damage) compared with 5 % perimeter (10. 86 % ear damage), although the reasons for this are not clear.

40|$|High {{nitrogen}} (N) application {{rates are}} used by <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> as an ‘insurance’, but may have an adverse effect on the environment. In this paper, the potential for nitrogen savings {{by the use of}} site-specific N fertilization rates is reviewed. Various tools for a more precise assessment of N requirements are available. Adjustments of N rates to the amounts of soil mineral N present shortly before planting can contribute to efficient N use, as can a deliberate delay of N dressings combined with indicator-based N supplementation after emergence. Conditions, under which these strategies are effective, are discussed. Post-emergence tests indicate whether a crop is likely to respond to sidedress N, but few tests quantify how much N should be sidedressed. Tissue tests are of less value for the support of decisions on N supplementation than indicators that are directly related to the soil or to the measurement of leaf and canopy greenness. Greenness and tissue tests are both unable to quantify excessive availability of N at early crop stages, as opposed to soil related indicators. Moreover, all crop tests generally need an on-site calibration with a reference plot. At later sampling dates, indicators can provide clues for the adjustment of N management in subsequent maize crops. The late stalk nitrate test and the post-harvest soil mineral N test appear to be the most valuable. Although indicators capable of identifying fields with an excessive N availability may save money, little {{attention has been paid to}} a cost-benefit analysis of indicator-based site-specific N management...|$|R

Our foragemaize crops are generally higher yielding but of lower quality than those grown in Europe but are {{on a par with}} those grown in the United States. Genetic diversity of maize hybrids and the ranges in crop management and climate in Australiahave produced silages withvariable nutritive values. Stage of maturity at harvest is important and a milk line which marks the margin between the starch and milk phase in the grain correlates well with crop dry matter (DM) content, has been adopted in N. S. W. Until recently, little attention has been given to the role of maize silage as a supplement to grazing animals. Research at Kyabram has quantified marginalresponsesto supplementationandthe effect of pasture quality on milk responses to various levels of maize silage in the diets of grazing cows. Duringearly lactation, marginal responses are approximatelyl. 0 1 milk/kg silage DM on grass and 1. 4 1 milk/kg silage DM on higher quality clover diets. Cows grazing grass pastures (containing up to 25 g N/kg DM) can consume up to 40 % of their diet as maize silage before requiring additional protein supplements whereas cows grazing clover pastures (with 35 g N/kg DM) can show milk responses with up to 60 % maize silageintheir diet DM. The potential for maize silage in beef production has been shown at Wagga Wagga where growth rates of over lkg/day were achievedinyoung steers fed entirely on maize silage plus minerals plus urea. The integration of clover pastures and conserved forage crops should lead to large productivity gains which on irrigated dairy farms in northern Victoria, could amount to over 80 % above current levels.

40|$|Most {{people are}} {{familiar}} with the hungry caterpillar in the vegetable garden or the elusive beetle in the pantry, and contending with these unwelcomed pests is a longstanding problem. Ever since humans started farming they have shared part of their harvest with insects. <b>Growers</b> of <b>maize,</b> Zea mays(corn), are challenged with a number of pests, but the most important are lepidopteran larvae (i. e., caterpillars) that are stalk borers, ear or leaf feeders, and coleopteran larvae (i. e., beetle grubs) that feed on roots. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, for example, was nicknamed the 2 ̆ 2 billion dollar bug 2 ̆ 2 because it cost growers over a billion dollars annually in insecticides and lost crop yields (Figure 1). Most <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> rely on traditional crop protection practices to manage these insects, including cultural, biological or chemical (insecticide) methods or a balance of these methods that aims to minimize environmental impact called integrated pest management (IPM) (Hellmich et al. 2008). However, in 1996 USA growers were introduced to commercial maize that was genetically engineered (GE) with resistance to European corn borer and other lepidopteran maize pests. In 2003 another GE maize was introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae (beetle grubs), especially larvae of the western corn rootworm,Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, another 2 ̆ 2 billion dollar bug 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 2). These GE plants produce crystal (Cry) proteins or toxins derived from the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), hence the common name 2 ̆ 2 Bt maize 2 ̆ 2. Bt maize has revolutionized pest control in a number of countries, but there still are questions about its use and impact.

40|$|AbstractAmaizeN is a {{decision}} support system to help <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> schedule nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications for site-specific maize crops. It forecasts crop yields and N-fertilizer application rates for potential yield and best economic returns, and predicts the consequences of user management decisions. It takes into account both crop production and environmental impact. In this article we describe the system functionality and underlying crop models, and the system validity and effectiveness evaluated in 16 field trials covering {{a wide range of}} weather and soil conditions. At each trial site crops received either two or four N-fertilizer application rates, including one rate recommended by AmaizeN. The AmaizeN-predicted maize yields matched field measurements well (r 2 = 0. 77; p< 0. 001 for silage, and r 2 = 0. 55; p< 0. 001 for grain), and gave a reasonably good indication of silage crude protein content (r 2 = 0. 28; p< 0. 001) and silage harvest date (r 2 = 0. 71; p< 0. 0006). The system was also capable of estimating N-leaching during the cropping season and predicting residual soil mineral-N {{at the end of the}} season (r 2 = 0. 47; p< 0. 001), but more effort is needed to improve the accuracy of some predictions. In all instances the AmaizeN-recommended N-fertilizer strategy was more efficient than the growers’ practice. Recommended N-fertilizer rates were on average 85 kgha− 1 less than conventional application rates across 10 crops, with no yield reduction. Its recommended higher-than-conventional application rate at another crop brought about a significant yield increase. System development was guided by an industry user group who requested the decision support system interface to be ‘simple and easy to use’. To ensure user adoption of the system some compromises in system prediction accuracy were required. Local agricultural production conditions were also incorporated...|$|R

Weeds constituent one of the major economic important problem for <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> because they can reduce yield up to 86 per cent. A field experiment were conducted for two years at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore during kharif seaons of 2010 and 2011 to evaluate the weed management options for transgenic stacked (TC 1507 & NK 603) and conventional maize hybrids. The experiments were conducted with the following objective to evaluate the weed control efficiency and crop productivity with K salt of glyphosate formulations under field conditions. Treatments consisted of two transgenic stacked hybrids named 30 V 92 and 30 B 11 applied with glyphosate as early post emergence at 900 and 1800 g a. e ha- 1 during kharif, 2010 and conventional maize hybrids named 30 V 92 and 30 B 11 applied with glyphosate by controlled droplet application method at 900, 1350 and 1800 g a. e ha- 1 during kharif, 2011,these were compared with non transgenic counterpart maize hybrids applied with pre emergence atrazine at 0. 5 kg ha- 1 followed by one hand weeding on 40 DAS with and without insect management. Based on the two years field experimentation, it was found that early post emergence application of glyphosate at 1800 g a. e ha- 1 gave significantly lower weed density, weed dry weight and higher weed control efficiency at all the intervals. Higher grain yield was registered with post emergence application of glyphosate at 1800 g a. e ha- 1 in transgenic and conventional maize hybrid of 30 V 92 (12. 21 t ha- 1 and 11. 23 t ha- 1) during both the seasons of study.

The food value chain (FVC) introduced in Nigeria to transform agriculture is commendable because {{through the system}} farmers receive various incentives as highly subsidized inputs from government and loans of low interest rates from designated Agricultural Banks and Central Bank. However, the system encourages specialization {{in the production of}} the reference crops but intercropping and mixed cropping systems practiced by most small-holder farmers because of its inherent advantages is de-emphasized or completely abandoned. This paper presents the results of two surveys of sole pepper and <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> in 2015 and 2016 respectively as affected by sudden stoppage of rainfall in Nsukka area. The analyses showed that on the average > 70 % of the pepper farmers lost ≈ 65 % of their pepper fields while ≈ 57 % of the maize fields were lost. For a substitute intercropping system, plantain yield data from plantain plus moringa intercrop trials carried out in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed and projected to incorporate a food crop within inter-alleys. The mean plantain yields from the trials were 20 kg plant- 1 for fresh bunch and 7 suckers stand- 1. Based on a 6 m x 5 m (≈ 330 plants ha- 1) spacing and the 2016 prices of bunches and suckers, these yields translated to a minimum net income per annum of N 1 320 000. 00 (N 330 000. 00 from bunches and N 990 000. 00 from 6 suckers (net) stand- 1). Proceeds from the food crop, moringa seed and leaf extracts used as liquid fertilizer took care of the cost of other inputs and cultural practices. The inter-row spacing of 6 m allows mechanical cultivation of any food crop by the farmer. This system was considered a reliable insurance against climate change and pest insurgence and can be adopted by farmers in the entire southern Nigeria because both plantain and moringa can do very well in the subregion...|$|R

This technology has been patented for use with insect pathogenic viruses in the United States and Canada. A baculovirus is currently being tested for its potential as a biological insecticide of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the principal insect pest of maize in Mesoamerica. A multiply embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus isolate originally from Nicaragua was bioassayed alone and {{in the presence of the}} optical brightener Tinopal LPW (1 %), using second instar S. frugiperda larvae. The LC 50 value of the virus alone was calculated at 82. 1 polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIBs) /mm 2 of diet compared with 0. 71 PIBs/mm 2 in the presence of Tinopal LPW. In contrast to other studies, the mean time to death of larvae exposed to virus and Tinopal LPW was significantly extended compared to larvae inoculated with virus alone. Analysis of the results of eight independent field trials in Mexico and Honduras revealed a significant positive relationship between log virus dose and percentage mortality observed in S. frugiperda larvae. Virus-induced mortality was approximately 50 % at the highest application rate tested: 1000 larval equivalents (LE) of virus/ha. When the impact of parasitism was taken into account, larval mortality increased to 45. 0 – 90. 7 % in plots treated with virus at 250 LE/ha or more. A cost analysis indicated that approximately 60 % pest control can be achieved as a conservative estimate with virus application and the action of parasitoids for the price of a chemical insecticide. Formulating the virus with an optical brightener appears to be an attractive option based on laboratory findings but requires field testing. The use of optical brightener technology will probably be feasible for <b>maize</b> <b>growers</b> in Mesoamerica only if it is highly effective at very low concentrations (< 0. 1 %) or the volume of the virus application can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Maize is {{a highly}} {{important}} crop to many countries around the world, through {{the sale of the}} maize crop to domestic processors and subsequent production of maize products and also provides a staple food to subsistance farms in undeveloped countries. In many countries, there have been long-term research efforts to develop a suitable hardness method that could assist the maize industry in improving efficiency in processing as well as possibly providing a quality specification for <b>maize</b> <b>growers,</b> which could attract a premium. This paper focuses specifically on hardness and reviews a number of methodologies as well as important biochemical aspects of maize that contribute to maize hardness used internationally. Numerous foods are produced from maize, and hardness has been described as having an impact on food quality. However, the basis of hardness and measurement of hardness are very general and would apply to any use of maize from any country. From the published literature, it would appear that one of the simpler methods used to measure hardness is a grinding step followed by a sieving step, using multiple sieve sizes. This would allow the range in hardness within a sample as well as average particle size and/or coarse/fine ratio to be calculated. Any of these parameters could easily be used as reference values for the development of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy calibrations. The development of precise NIR calibrations will provide an excellent tool for breeders, handlers, and processors to deliver specific cultivars in the case of growers and bulk loads in the case of handlers, thereby ensuring the most efficient use of maize by domestic and international processors. This paper also considers previous research describing the biochemical aspects of maize that have been related to maize hardness. Both starch and protein affect hardness, with most research focusing on the storage proteins (zeins). Both the content and composition of the zein fractions affect hardness. Genotypes and growing environment influence the final protein and starch content and, to a lesser extent, composition. However, hardness {{is a highly}} heritable trait and, hence, when a desirable level of hardness is finally agreed upon, the breeders will quickly be able to produce material with the hardness levels required by the industry. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
