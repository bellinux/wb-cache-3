50|$|Its volunteers {{included}} its captain <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> (sculptor), sous-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Francesqui (sculptor {{known as}} Fransechi-Delorme), sous-officier Louis-François Lejeune (painter), private Jacques Augustin Catherine Pajou (painter) {{and the future}} economist Jean-Baptiste Say.|$|R
50|$|The Louis XIII Wall was {{designed}} by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> and built between 1633 and 1636. It enlarged the Charles V Wall over {{the western part of}} the right bank (now the First and Second Arrondissements).|$|R
50|$|The {{pavilion}} {{was built}} {{just north of}} the older Lescot Wing between 1624 and about 1645. The famous structure, with its square-domed roof, was designed by architect <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> (1585-1654). The name comes from a clock (French: horloge) later incorporated into its elevation.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{called the}} Palais-Cardinal, the palace was the {{personal}} residence of Cardinal Richelieu. The architect <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> began his design in 1629; construction commenced in 1633 and {{was completed in}} 1639. Upon Richelieu's death in 1642 the palace became {{the property of the}} King and acquired the new name Palais-Royal.|$|R
50|$|The castle of the Dukes of La Trémoille, {{designed}} by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> and completed in 1635 - 1638. Its main façade {{is more than}} 110 m tall. After the Trémouilles were dispossessed during the French Revolution, the château became a barracks and later a prison. It has been restored for its present use as a middle school.|$|R
50|$|Just to {{the north}} of the Lescot Wing are the Pavillon de l'Horloge, the Lemercier Wing, and the Pavillon de Beauvais. This {{northern}} extension was begun in 1624 under Louis XIII and Richelieu, but work was halted around 1626 due to lack of funds and only completed in 1639-1642 to the designs of <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier.</b> The Lemercier Wing is a symmetrical extension of Lescot's Wing in exactly the same Renaissance style. With the addition of the Lemercier Wing, the last external vestiges of the medieval Louvre were demolished.|$|R
50|$|Nicolas Lemercier or Le Mercier (1541 - 1637) was a French {{architect}} or master mason. He {{was the son}} of architect/mason Pierre Lemercier and {{may have}} been the father of <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier.</b> Works attributed to Nicolas include Pontoise Cathedral and the nave of the church of Saint-Eustache, Paris. He was succeeded at Saint-Eustache by his son-in-law Charles David, who married Nicolas' daughter Anne.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> (c. 1585 Pontoise [...] - [...] 13 January 1654 Paris) was a French {{architect}} and engineer, {{one of the}} influential trio that included Louis Le Vau and François Mansart who formed the classicizing French Baroque manner, drawing from French traditions of the previous century and current Roman practice the fresh, essentially French synthesis associated with Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIII.|$|R
50|$|The Church of the Val-de-Grâce is a Roman Catholic {{church in}} the 5th {{arrondissement}} of Paris, {{in what is now}} the Val-de-Grâce Hospital. The edifice was formerly a royal abbey, and its dome is a principal landmark of the skyline of Paris. The church was initially designed by François Mansart, succeeded by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> who designed the Saint-Sacrament chapel's spiral-coffered dome after Philibert de L'Orme's chapel at the Château d'Anet.|$|R
5000|$|Louis XIII {{architecture}} {{was equally}} influenced by Italian styles. The greatest French {{architect of the}} era, Salomon de Brosse, designed the Palais du Luxembourg for Marie de' Medici. De Brosse began a tradition of classicism in architecture that was continued by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> who completed the Palais and whose own most famous work of the Louis XIII period is the chapel of the Sorbonne (1635). Under {{the next generation of}} architects, French Baroque would take an even greater classical shift.|$|R
2500|$|In architecture, architects like Salomon de Brosse, François Mansart and <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> helped {{define the}} French {{form of the}} baroque, {{developing}} the formula of the urban hôtel particulier that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the palazzo. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic-baroque style, {{some of the most}} famous being Maisons and Cheverny, characterized by high roofs [...] "à la française" [...] and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} Salomon de Brosse (1571-1626) {{introduced a}} new style of façade, based on the traditional orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), placed one above the other. He first used this style in the façade of the Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais (1616-20). The style of the three superimposed orders appeared again in the Eglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, the new Jesuit church in Paris, designed by the Jesuit architects Etienne Martellange and François Derand. Saint-Roch (1653-90), designed by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> had a Gothic plan but colorful Italian-style decoration.|$|R
50|$|The Val-de-Grâce was {{commissioned}} by Anne in 1645, which was undertaken initially by Francois Mansart, who was dismissed in 1646 and succeeded by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier.</b> As well as being her main place of worship, the Val-de-Grâce displays dynastic significance for Anne, whose role as Queen Regent during La Fronde. In 1662 Anne acquired the hearts of her ancestors Anne Elizabeth of France, placed in the Chapel of Saint Anne. She herself was interred in 1666 in the Chapel of Saint Sacrament, along with the body of Marguerite d'Arbouze.|$|R
50|$|It is Louis XIII who {{destroys the}} north {{wall of the}} castle (1624). The Lescot Wing wa built for a court {{with the size of}} the one of the castle. It was not easy to {{integrate}} it into a courtyard whose sides would be twice as long. The idea of the new architect <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> is to duplicate this wing to the north : it will be the present Lemercier Wing (1636). And to install a pavilion between the two : the Pavillon de l’Horloge, today pavilion Sully.|$|R
50|$|Château de Rueil. In gardens {{laid out}} by Jean Thiriot to designs of <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> Francini's Grand Cascade {{completed}} about 1638 for the Cardinal de Richelieu, lay {{at the end of}} the Grande Allée. It has been suggested that Rueil's cascade and gardens were inspired by those of the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati. In turn the formal Cascade of Rueil down thirty steps inspired more naturalistic cascades at Versailles, St-Cloud and at Château de Sceaux The cascade at Rueil was replaced by lawn in 1720 and the park was remodelled by the Empress Josephine as part of her Château de Malmaison.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of her husband, Anne became Queen-Regent to her four-year-old son, now Louis XIV. In {{gratitude}} for her son, Anne pressed forward with the construction of an entirely rebuilt church and monastery, [...] "to spare no expense and to leave an eternal mark of her piety." [...] In 1645 Anne engaged François Mansart as the project's architect, but Mansart departed after only a year after disagreement over the scope and cost of the project. The church was finally finished in 1667, after the successive participation of Mansart, <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> Pierre Le Muet and Gabriel Leduc.|$|R
50|$|In 1521, the {{tradesman}} Jean Dinocheau had {{a chapel}} {{built on the}} outskirts of Paris, which he dedicated to Saint Susanna. In 1577, his nephew Etienne Dinocheau had it extended into a larger church. In 1629, it became the parish church and thereafter underwent further work. The first stone of the church of Saint-Roch was laid by Louis XIV in 1653, accompanied by his mother Anne of Austria. Originally designed by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> the building's construction was halted in 1660 and was resumed in 1701 under the direction of architect Jacques Hardouin-Mansart, brother of the better-known Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Work was finally completed in 1754.|$|R

50|$|In Paris, {{the dome}} of St. Marie de la Visitation was built by François Mansart from 1632 to 1633, who would later design the church of Val-de-Grâce (1645-1710), built to commemorate the birth of Louis XIV. The dome of Val-de-Grâce, however, was {{designed}} by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> after having worked in Rome for seven years. It includes an inscription around the dome relating to the Bourbon kings. Inspired by St. Peter's Basilica, its dome likewise has two shells, but the outer shell is much taller in order {{to compensate for the}} foreshortening effect from viewing the exterior dome from nearby on the ground. The inner shell is made of stone and the outer shell is made of wood.|$|R
50|$|In 1642, {{disgusted by}} the intrigues of Simon Vouet, Fouquières and the {{architect}} <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> Poussin withdrew to Rome. There, in 1648, he finished for de Chantelou the second {{series of the}} Seven Sacraments (Bridgewater Gallery), and also his noble Landscape with Diogenes (Louvre). This painting shows the philosopher discarding his last worldly possession, his cup, after watching a man drink water by cupping his hands. In 1649 he painted the Vision of St Paul (Louvre) for the comic poet Paul Scarron, and in 1651 the Holy Family (Louvre) for the duc de Créquy. Year by year he continued to produce an enormous variety of works, {{many of which are}} included in the list given by Félibien.|$|R
50|$|Born in Paris, {{he was the}} son of Girard Marot, a cabinetmaker of Netherlandish origin. Early in {{his career}} Jean Marot worked for the print {{publisher}} Israël Henriet, for whom he engraved architectural views in collaboration with Israël Silvestre, who may have provided sketches and engraved landscapes, and Stefano della Bella, who engraved figures and other embellishments. Among the architects whose designs Marot engraved (and interpreted) are Gianlorenzo Bernini, Salomon de Brosse, <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier,</b> François Mansart, Louis Le Vau, Claude Perrault, and Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Marot also engraved plates after Vignola, Scamozzi, Palladio, and Philibert de L'Orme. Among the more notable buildings represented are the former Château de Richelieu, the Hôtel royal des Invalides, the Louvre in 1676, and the former Château de Madrid in 1678.|$|R
50|$|The new {{architectural}} style was sometimes called Flamboyant Gothic or French baroque. It appeared {{in several other}} new churches, including Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle (1624, damaged and then demolished after the Revolution), Notre-Dame-des-Victoires (1629), Saint-Sulpice (1646), and Saint-Roch (1653).Civil architecture of the period was particularly characterized by red brick alternating with white stone around the windows and doors, and marking the different stories, and by a high roof of black slate. The high roof, particularly used by Mansart, allowed an extra floor of habitation, became known as a Mansart roof. Notable civil buildings of the period include the Pavillon de Horloge of the Louvre by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> (1620-1624), the Luxembourg Palace by Salomon de Brosse (begun 1615), and the houses around the Place des Vosges.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the château are obscure, but it was {{probably}} initially constructed in the 1560s and purchased in 1606 by a courtier of Henri IV of France, Jean de Moisset, who added to the château and acquired additional land {{for the expansion of}} the gardens. The property was bought in 1633 by Cardinal Richelieu, who had the architect <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> remodel and enlarge the château, as well as the gardens and grounds. The château and grounds were renovated again in 1750 by Philippe Dullin de La Ponneraye. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, the buildings were demolished, and the estate was subdivided. Remnants include three basins (one four-lobed), a house (now known as the Maison du Père Joseph), and a stone bench, all formerly part of the gardens.|$|R

50|$|Another type {{of church}} facade {{appeared}} in the same period, imitating {{the church of the}} Jesuits in Rome built in 1568. This facade had two levels; the lower level was the height of the chapels, while the upper level featured a high fronton above the doors. The two levels were connected with s-shaped volutes and consoles, and the whole facade was covered with niches and other decorative elements. Inside the church was rectangular with a high vaulted ceiling, with chapels on both sides. This style of church usually had a dome, the symbol of the ideal in Renaissance architecture. This style was used by <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> for the chapel of the Sorbonne (1635-1642), and by François Mansart for the church of the Val-de-Grace, built for Anne of Austria, the widow of Louis XIII. It was part of a large complex modeled after the Escorial in Spain, which combined a church, a convent, and apartments for the Queen.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the Louvre {{was one of the}} major Paris architectural projects of the 17th century, and the palace architecture clearly showed the transition from the French Renaissance to the classical style of Louis XIV. <b>Jacques</b> <b>Lemercier</b> had built the Pavillon de l'Orloge in 1624-39 in an ornate baroque style. Between 1667 and 1678 Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, François d'Orbay and Claude Perrault rebuilt the east exterior façade of the courtyard with a long colonnade. A competition was held in 1670 for the south façade, which included a proposal from the Italian architect Bernini. Louis XIV rejected Bernini's Italianate plan in favor of a classical design by Perrault, which had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade and a series of massive columns an triangular pediments designed to convey elegance and power. Louis Le Vau and Claude Perrault rebuilt the interior façade of the cour Carée of the Louvre in a more classical version than that of the facing Renaissance façade. The Louvre was gradually transformed from a Renaissance and baroque palace to the classical grand style of Louis XIV.|$|R
