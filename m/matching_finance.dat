40|$|Regional {{governments in}} Spain have {{considerable}} autonomy for the provision and financing of healh {{care and other}} public services. The Act of 2001 set up redistributive transfers (fondo de suficiencia) between regions to ensure that at least a minimum level of basic common services could be provided to each citizen, weighted for need. This article develops an economic model of the financing of public services in Sapin and examines whether this system of redistribution has continued to maintain equity since its establishment, given variation in rates fo economic and demographic growth between regions. The {{results indicate that the}} system of transfers established in the Act of 2001 has not kept pace with changes in the distribution of population needs and economic activity in Spain. Assuming that need <b>matched</b> <b>finance</b> in all regions in 1999, we calculated the Gini coefficient in 2005 to be 0, 018. However, this summary measure may obscure the magnitude of changes for individual regions. To maintain equity of health care provision in 2005 compared with 1999, transfers from the sufficiency fund would have to increase faster than national economic growth in Valencia, Canarias, Catalu??a, La Rioja and Murcia, and increase slower than national economic growth in Cantabria, Arag??n, Extremadura, Asturias, Castilla y Le??n and Andaluc??a. Contributions to the suffieciency fund by Madrid and Baleares would need to reduce over time. These results are based on a very simple aggregate model of public finance. Further, more detailed work is needed to verify the findings, to construct a robust formula that reflects relative need for health-care services, and to clarify how the sufficiency fund will operate if rates of economic growth are negative...|$|R

This thesis examines the performance of the Enterprise Development Programme [EDP] which was set up to grant assist high growth potential start-ups in Ireland. Of the 239 start-ups grant-assisted under the programme between 1978 and 1992, 129 or 54 per cent were no longer trading in 1994. 4670 jobs were created in surviving firms and the vast majority were created in a small number of fast growth firms. 62 per cent of all jobs were created in 9. 2 per cent of EDP start-ups. The financial structure of the fast growth EDP start-ups is compared with a match group of surviving EDP firms which demonstrated slower growth patterns. Fast growth firms were less likely than match firms to be predominantly owned by the owners and their families. Consistent with this finding new share issues were found to be a relatively more important source of finance for fast growth than for match firms. Fast growth firms also financed a relatively higher proportion of total assets from share premiums, whilst <b>match</b> firms <b>financed</b> a relatively higher proportion of total assets from ordinary shares.

The first working paper in this series explored the origins of VP and its development and expansion in Europe.

This is a high-engagement, partnership approach analogous to the practices of venture capital in building the commercial value of companies. In its modern form, venture philanthropy developed significantly in the US in the mid 1990 s, took hold in the UK from 2002 and is now expanding into continental Europe. Although not without its sceptics, venture philanthropy {{has the potential to}} contribute to developing a more responsive and diverse capital market for the social sector. Its focus on building organisational capacity in entrepreneurial social purpose organisations, <b>matching</b> appropriate <b>finance</b> with strategic business-like advice, makes it a distinctive provider of capital. Venture philanthropy in Europe has strong links to the private equity and venture capital community, giving it opportunities to influence the corporate social responsibility of a set of major players in Europe's financial services industry. Several new venture philanthropy funds have been established by philanthropists with successful careers in private equity. Europe's transitional countries, in Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and former Soviet Union, have under-capacitated social sectors and widespread, unmet social needs. Venture philanthropy may have a particularly valuable role to play in helping build stronger civil society institutions in these countries. As a relatively young industry, venture philanthropy faces many challenges in communicating and marketing what it does; developing a menu of financial instruments and advisory services; measuring performance and social impact; collaborating with complementary capital providers such as foundations.

40|$|The {{changing}} social, {{financial and}} regulatory frameworks, {{such as an}} increasingly aging society, the current low interest rate environment, {{as well as the}} implementation of Solvency II, lead to the search for new product forms for private pension provision. In order to address the various issues, these product forms should reduce or avoid investment guarantees and risks stemming from longevity, still provide reliable insurance benefits and simultaneously take account of the increasing financial resources required for very high ages. In this context, we examine whether a historical concept of insurance, the tontine, entails enough innovative potential to extend and improve the prevailing privately funded pension solutions in a modern way. The tontine basically generates an age-increasing cash flow, which can help to <b>match</b> the increasing <b>financing</b> needs at old ages. However, the tontine generates volatile cash flows, so that - especially {{in the context of an}} aging society - the insurance character of the tontine cannot be guaranteed in every situation.

As the sources of funding for universities are almost entirely domestic and, in most countries, primarily governmental, politicians are expected to ensure that increasing public investment in higher education is justified in terms of the benefits accruing to the domestic workforce and investors. In so doing, they must avoid disrupting the international, free community of scholars and students engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and, thus, destroying the historical source of wealth creation that academia represents. This article considers the current debate in Europe and recent research on the interactions between universities and labour markets.

40|$|We use a {{new data}} set that tracks U. S. firms from their birth {{over two decades}} to {{understand}} the life cycle dynamics and outcomes (both successes and failures) of VC- and non-VC financed firms. We first ask to what market-wide and firm-level characteristics venture capitalists respond in choosing to make their investments and how this differs for firms financed solely by non-VC sources of entrepreneurial capital. We then ask what are the eventual differences in outcomes for firms that receive VC financing relative to non-VC-financed firms. Our findings suggest that VCs follow public market signals similar to other investors and typically invest largely in young firms, with potential for large scale being an important criterion. The main way that VC financed firms differ from <b>matched</b> non-VC <b>financed</b> firms, is they demonstrate remarkably larger scale both for successful and failed firms, at every point of the firms' life cycle. They grow more rapidly, but we see little difference in profitability measures at times of exit. We further examine a number of hypotheses relating to VC-financed firms' failure. We find that VC-financed firms' cumulative failure rates are lower than non-VC-financed firms but the story is nuanced. VC appears initially "patient" in that VC-financed firms {{are less likely to}} fail in the first five years but conditional on surviving past this point become more likely to fail relative to non-VC-financed firms. We perform a number of robustness checks and find that VC {{does not appear to have}} more stringent survival thresholds nor do VC-financed firm failures appear to be disguised as acquisitions nor do particular kinds of VC firms seem to be driving our results. Overall, our analysis supports the view that VC is "patient" capital relative to other non-VC sources of entrepreneurial capital in the early part of firms' lifecycles and that an important criterion for receiving VC investment is potential for large scale, rather than level of profitability, prior to exit. ...|$|R

The Vietnamese government has recognised the importance of household tree plantations and, in particular, the benefits of giving households access {{to external}} finance. Not only has the government transferred around a quarter of Vietnam’s forestland to households, but it also offers them exceptional access to financial support through targeted programmes and the state-owned banking system. This report analyses the mechanisms used in 5 programmes that currently provide finance to households. It compares the 5 mechanisms against 7 criteria: availability; financial and operational sustainability; leakage to other productive activities; household access; cost to households; risk to households; and <b>match</b> with households’ <b>finance</b> requirements. In addition, it considers the finance requirements of 3 types of households, differentiated according to their investment rationales.

Aside from the reporting requirements of the UNFCCC, better financial data can help decision makers in developing countries identify gaps, improve coordination and management, and raise funds to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Better climate finance information can also enable countries to draw lessons from the use of different financial instruments and develop strategies and policies that aim to expand finance for climate change.
