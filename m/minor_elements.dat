5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E

The Khmer people constructed the Angkor monuments—which are widely distributed in Cambodia and Thailand—between the 9th and 13th centuries. The stone materials used were sandstone and laterite; brick {{had been used in}} monuments constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries. Two types of laterite can be identified; both types consist of the minerals kaolinite, quartz, hematite and goethite.

Prior to extraction, the petrologic setting of the grains was studied microscopically, and their <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> contents determined by microprobe analysis; samples that displayed {{a wide range of}} <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> contents were selected for detailed elementary analysis. Those samples of CaS suspected to be more primitive {{on the basis of their}} <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> and petrologic siting contain the entire inventory of the host meteorite's light REE (LREE) and Eu, plus 30 - 50 percent of the heavy-REE inventory. In less primitive samples, the LREE are less enriched although Eu remains highly concentrated. Several other elements, including lithophiles and chalcophiles, are most enriched in the most primitive CaS. It is suggested that oldhamite played a key role in the redistribution of these elements during the metamorphism and evolution of enstatite-rich material...|$|R

500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a little out of time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E
500|$|Yuji Horii, {{a fan of}} {{time travel}} fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the {{scenario}} of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, [...] "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm {{and come up with}} a variety of attractions to put in." [...] Sakaguchi contributed some <b>minor</b> <b>elements,</b> including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as [...] "a long string of errands... 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'." [...] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an [...] "Active Time Event Logic" [...] system, [...] "where you can move your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you", and with players [...] "talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions", allowing each scene to [...] "have many permutations." [...] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{relatively}} few minerals {{that are important}} in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> and for trace elements. Contents of major and <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term [...] "trace element" [...] is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).|$|E

40|$|Nakhlites are olivine-bearing clinopyroxene cumulates [e. g., 1]. Based on {{petrographic}} characteristics, {{they may}} be divided into groups that cooled at different rates {{and may have been}} formed at different depths in a single flow [e. g., 2, 3]. The order of cooling rate is Lafayette < Governador Valadares ~ Nakhla < Yamato 000593 < NWA 817 ~ MIL 03346. Nakhlite cumulus pyroxene grains consist of large cores that are nearly homogeneous in major element composition surrounded by thin rims that are zoned to Fe-rich compositions. Detailed study of these pyroxenes is important because they retain a record of the crystallization history of the nakhlite magma. Moreover, because the composition of the nakhlite parent melt cannot be directly determined, inversion of the major and <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> composition of the cumulate pyroxene cores can be used to estimate the composition of that melt. Thus {{it is important to understand}} the major and <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> zoning in the cumulus pyroxenes. We recently reported complications in the <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> zoning of nakhlite pyroxenes, especially for Al and Cr [4]. This abstract reports additional complications noted since that report...|$|R

2500|$|In Portland cement clinker, calcium aluminoferrite {{occurs as}} an [...] "interstitial phase", {{crystallizing}} from the melt. Its presence in clinker is solely {{due to the}} need to obtain liquid at the peak kiln processing temperature (1400−1450°C), facilitating the formation of the desired silicate phases. Apart from this benefit, its effects on cement properties are little more than those of a diluent. Its forms an impure solid solution that deviates markedly in composition from the simple chemical formula. The calcium aluminoferrite phase acts as a repository for many of the <b>minor</b> <b>elements</b> in the clinker. Most of the transitional elements in the cement are found in the ferrite phase, notably titanium, manganese and zinc. There is also a substantial amount of magnesium and silicon, and because of this, oxides other than CaO, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 often make up 15% of the mass of the calcium aluminoferrite. This substitution reduces the melting point to around 1350°C.|$|E

40|$|Pennington Formation {{limestone}} {{deposits in}} Tennessee have echinoderm grains that exhibit spatial variations in <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> and stable isotopic compositions {{with respect to}} the paleokarst surface that defines the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian stratigraphic contact. Echinoderm grains immediately below the paleokarst surface have lower Mg and d 13 C values with higher Fe concentrations compared with grains meters below the paleokarst surface. Additionally, covariation of d 13 C and d 18 O values recorded from echinoderm grains is indicative of alteration of these allochems under meteoric conditions. Paleosols draping the paleokarst surface and coal seams, which were deposited immediately above the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian contact, provided ample organic matter that could have driven heterotrophic microbial activity. Additionally, the paleosols were an ample source of oxidized Fe that could have used as a terminal electron acceptor by an anaerobic microbial community. Therefore, we suggest that microbial iron reduction transferred Fe from the paleosol to meteoric diagenetic calcite during meteoric stabilization of echinoderm grains, which is supported by quantitative modeling of carbonate solubility (PHREEQC) and iterative modeling of diagenetic calcite <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> and stable isotopic compositions...|$|R

We show that by maintaining the petrologic context (edge, middle, and {{center of the}} inclusion plus their host silicate phase), four populations of spinels are resolvable based on their <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> contents. One population resides within the edge area (mainly mantle melilite) and {{is characterized by the}} highest V contents. Unlike Leoville 3537 – 2, many edge grains from Allende TS- 23 also have high-Fe contents (up to 4. 0 wt%) and low-Cr values. Based on their V and Ti concentrations (which is positively correlated), middle and center grains define a trend that is divided into three populations: spinels enclosed by melilite, fassaite, and anorthite. The overall range in Ti concentration based on fractional crystallization should be much less than a factor of 2; however, the observed range is considerably larger. The <b>minor</b> <b>element</b> contents of these grains are interpreted as recording alteration, primary fractional crystallization, and a complex igneous history that may involve remelting and recrystallization. From our data, Allende TS- 23 has experienced more alteration than Leoville 3537 – 2, which is consistent with previous petrologic studies of silicates within these objects; yet both objects have likely been remelted (at least one additional melting event, possibly two, postdating the initial formation of these CAIs). By invoking a remelting history, the large range ir Ti concentrations and the different populations of spinels can be explained. Although our data suggest that more than one generation of spinels exist within these objects, we are unable to establish any population of relic spinel grains that predate the initial melting event...|$|R
