30|$|However, the {{comparison}} of wage effects for individuals whose labour market status changed between the two survey dates might be impaired {{by the fact that}} people who switch from a mismatched job to a matched job or vice versa are not comparable to the reference group. To take these factors into account, additional models are calculated for the subsample of individuals who are employed at both survey times. More specifically, two standard methods are applied: the lagged dependent variable and fixed effect regression techniques. Neither model can entirely control for selectivity, but they provide reasonable bounds within which the causal effect of a job-education-mismatch should lie. The lagged outcome regression (Model 9) assumes that the earnings history contains information unobservable to the researcher and that, to the extent that lagged income is a good predictor of future income, the coefficients for the mismatch should be unbiased (see, e.g., Ashenfelter and Card 1985). The comparison between the coefficients in Models 8 and 9 shows quite similar coefficients, which result from the fact that individuals with a mismatch in the first-wave survey who changed to a <b>matched</b> <b>position</b> in the second-wave survey had similar entry wages as individuals who remained in a mismatched job. The same holds for individuals who switched from match to mismatch compared to those who always occupied a <b>matched</b> <b>position.</b> 10 The results suggest that selectivity is not the main factor explaining the earnings differentials between matched and mismatched graduates. Finally, the findings from the fixed effects regression (model 10) validate the previous findings, which provides a lower bound for the causal effect of a mismatch on wages.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMap-matching {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the Horizontal Uncertainty Level (HUL) of GNSS position fixes. Integrity monitoring is indeed an important issue for autonomous vehicles navigation. The method is based on the use of a high definition map that stores accurate information about theroad network. This additional source of information is crucial for autonomous navigation. The <b>matched</b> <b>position</b> is computed using proprioceptive sensors from the car and GNSS fixes that are handled using a precautionary principle with Horizontal Protection Levels (HPL). A Particle Filter is used for its ability to manage multiple hypotheses if needed. Estimating different likely map-matched hypotheses allows to determine the levelof uncertainty of the GNSS which is defined as the maximum distance between a map-matched hypothesis and a given GNSS position. This distance {{can be seen as a}} Map-Aided Horizontal Uncertainty Level (MA-HUL), providing a confidence indicator to the vehicle for integrity monitoring. This paper presents the multi-hypotheses map-matching algorithm and a method to compute the MA-HUL values in real-time.

40|$|NoDynamic speech properties, such as time warping, silence {{removal and}} {{background}} noise reduction {{are the most}} challenging issues in continuous speech signal matching. Among all of them, the time warped speech signal matching is of great interest {{and has been a}} tough challenge for the researchers. The literature contains a variety of techniques to measure the similarity between speech utterances, however there are some limitations associated with these techniques. This paper introduces an adaptive framing based continuous speech tracking and similarity measurement approach that uses a Kalman filter (KF) as a robust tracker. The use of KF is novel for time warped speech signal matching and dynamic time warping. A dynamic state model is presented based on equations of linear motion. In this model, fixed length frame of input (test) speech signal is considered as a unidirectional moving object by sliding it along the template speech signal. The best <b>matched</b> <b>position</b> estimate in template speech (sample number) for corresponding test frame at current time is calculated. Simultaneously, another position observation is produced by a feature based distance metric. The position estimated by the state model is fused with the observation using KF along with the noise variances. The best estimated frame position in the template speech for the current state is calculated. Finally, forecasting of the noise variances and template frame size for next state are made according to the KF output. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique in terms of time warped speech signal matching as well as in computation cost...|$|E

For constant-sized alphabets, our preprocessing takes O(|T| 2) time and space, achieving the answering time O(|P|+w), where Ur denotes the number of <b>matched</b> <b>positions</b> and w⩽Ur. For the case of large-sized alphabets, our preprocessing can still be implemented with O(|T| 2) time and space, while the answering time is slightly increased to O(|P|+w+log|T|).

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} querying a string (or, a database) of length N bits to determine all the locations where a substring (query) of length M appears either exactly or is within a Hamming distance of K from the query. We assume that sketches of the original signal can be computed off line and stored. Using the sparse Fourier transform computation based approach introduced by Pawar and Ramchandran, we show that all such matches can be determined with high probability in sub-linear time. Specifically, if the query length M = O(N^μ) {{and the number of}} matches L=O(N^λ), we show that for λ < 1 -μ all the <b>matching</b> <b>positions</b> can be determined with a probability that approaches 1 as N →∞ for K ≤ 1 / 6 M. More importantly our scheme has a worst-case computational complexity that is only O({N^ 1 -μ^ 2 N, N^μ+λ N }), which means we can recover all the <b>matching</b> <b>positions</b> in sub-linear time for λ< 1 -μ. This is a substantial improvement over the best known computational complexity of O(N^ 1 - 0. 359 μ) for recovering one <b>matching</b> <b>position</b> by Andoni et al. andoni 2013 shift.

BackgroundRadiotherapy of breast cancer is a routine task but has many challenges. We {{investigated}} residual position errors in whole breast radiotherapy when orthogonal setup images were matched to different bony landmarks. Materials and methodsA total of 1111 orthogonal setup image pairs and tangential field images were analyzed retrospectively for 50 consecutive patients. Residual errors in the treatment field images were determined by matching the orthogonal setup images to the vertebrae, sternum, ribs and their compromises. The most important region was the chest wall as it is crucial for the dose delivered to {{the heart and the}} ipsilateral lung. Inter-observer variation in online image matching was investigated. ResultsThe best general image <b>matching</b> <b>position</b> was the compromise of the vertebrae, ribs and sternum, while the worst position was the vertebrae alone (p≤ 0. 03). The setup margins required for the chest wall varied from 4. 3 mm to 5. 5 mm in the lung direction while in the superior–inferior (SI) direction the margins varied from 5. 1 mm to 7. 6 mm. The inter-observer variation increased the minimal margins by approximately 1 mm. The margin of the lymph node areas should be at least 4. 8 mm. ConclusionsSetup margins can be reduced by proper selection of a <b>matching</b> <b>position</b> for the orthogonal setup images.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Data {{stored on}} disks {{generally}} contain significant redundancy. A mechanism or algorithm that recodes {{the data to}} lessen the data size could possibly double or triple the effective data that could be stored on the media. One mechanism of doing this is by data compression. Many compression algorithms currently exist, but each one has its own advantages as well as disadvantages. The objective of this study', to formulate a new compression algorithm that could be implemented in a real-time mode in any file system. The new compression algorithm should also execute as fast as possible, {{so as not to}} cause a lag in the file systems performance. This study focuses on binary data of any type, whereas previous articles such as (Huftnlan. 1952 : 1098), (Ziv & Lempel, 1977 : 337 : 1978 : 530), (Storer & Szymanski. 1982 : 928) and (Welch, 1984 : 8) have placed particular emphasis on text compression in their discussions of compression algorithms for computer data. The resulting compression algorithm that is formulated by this study is Lempel-Ziv-Toutlc (LZT). LZT is basically an LZ 77 (Ziv & Lempel, 1977 : 337) encoder with a buffer size equal in size to that of the data block of the file system in question. LZT does not make this distinction, it discards the sliding buffer principle and uses each data block of the entire input stream. as one big buffer on which compression can be performed. LZT also handles the encoding of a match slightly different to that of LZ 77. An LZT match is encoded by two bit streams, the first specifying the <b>position</b> of the <b>match</b> and the other specifying the length of the match. This combination is commonly referred to as a pair. To encode the position portion of the pair, we make use of a sliding scale method. The sliding scale method works as follows. Let the position in the input buffer, of the current character to be compressed be held by inpos, where inpos is initially set to 3. It is then only possible for a match to occur at position 1 or 2. Hence the <b>position</b> of a <b>match</b> will never be greater than 2, and therefore the position portion can be encoded using only 1 bit. As "inpos" is incremented as each character is encoded, the <b>match</b> <b>position</b> range increases and therefore more bits will be required to encode the <b>match</b> <b>position.</b> The reason why a decimal 2 can be encoded 'sing only I bit can be explained as follows. When decimal values are converted to binary values, we get 010 = 02, 110 = 12, 210, = 102 etc. As a position of 0 will never be used, it is possible to develop a coding scheme where a decimal value of 1 can be represented by a binary value of 0, and a decimal value of 2 can be represented by binary value of 1. Only I bit is therefore needed to encode <b>match</b> <b>position</b> I and <b>match</b> <b>position</b> 2. In general. any decimal value n ca:) be represented by the binary equivalent for (n - 1). The number of bits needed to encode (n - 1), indicates the number of bits needed to encode the <b>match</b> <b>position.</b> The length portion of the pair is encoded using a variable length coding (vlc) approach. The vlc method performs its encoding by using binary blocks. The first binary block is 3 bits long, where binary values 000 through 110 represent decimal values I through 7...|$|R
