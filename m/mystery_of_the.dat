5|$|While no exact {{figure is}} available, <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem stood {{as the best}} first-week debut for the series until the Nintendo 3DS title Fire Emblem Awakening in 2012. As of 2002, <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem had sold 776,338 units. This made <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem the best-selling title in the Fire Emblem series to that date.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light with the original story content of <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was lowered to encourage new players to try the series.|$|E

5|$|BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen, {{commonly}} referred to as BS Fire Emblem, is an episodic tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and released in 1997 following the release of Genealogy of the Holy War. It acts as a prequel to the events of the first Fire Emblem title and <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem. The four episodes of BS Fire Emblem were broadcast between September and October 1997 on the Satellaview peripheral service, a system where short games were downloaded via satellite at given times of day. While it employs the same tactical gameplay as the mainline titles, it throws waves of enemies at the main party during a three-hour time limit. BS Fire Emblem was directed and designed by Kaga, while the music was composed by Tsujiyoko in her role as composer and sound director. The character artwork was done by Rika Suzuki, a newcomer to the Fire Emblem series who would later go on to create character illustrations for Fire Emblem Awakening. It was the first title in the Fire Emblem series to include voice acting, created using livestreaming during the original broadcast. The game used the technology created for <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem.|$|E
