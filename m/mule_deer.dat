5|$|In May 1980 {{wildlife}} researcher Brad Griffith of the University of Idaho {{started a}} three-year study to mark and count the <b>mule</b> <b>deer</b> in the monument. The National Park Service {{was concerned that}} the local herd might grow so large that it would damage its habitat. Griffith found that this group of <b>mule</b> <b>deer</b> has developed a drought evasion strategy unique for its species.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 <b>mule</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coyotes may {{compete with}} cougars in some areas. In the eastern Sierra Nevadas, coyotes compete with cougars over <b>mule</b> <b>deer.</b> Cougars usually outcompete coyotes, and may kill them occasionally, thus {{reducing}} coyote predation pressure on smaller carnivores such as foxes and bobcats.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit around the Itcha Range. Among them are cougars, wolves, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, <b>mule</b> <b>deers,</b> {{mountain}} goats, beavers, coyotes, red foxes, muskrats, martens, river otters, lynx and wolverines. Also present {{is the largest}} herd of woodland caribou in southern British Columbia, {{as well as the}} most northerly population of California bighorn sheep in North America.|$|R

5|$|Some of the fauna {{reported}} on the climb to the summit include black bears, marmots, <b>mule</b> <b>deer,</b> pikas, and pocket gophers; there are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey and bighorn sheep {{are present in the}} area during the summer.|$|E
5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and swallows. Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, the <b>mule</b> <b>deer,</b> cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.|$|E
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species.

5000|$|After the election, Hampton {{became known}} as the [...] "Savior of South Carolina," [...] and among those Democrats elected who were called [...] "Redeemers." [...] He was re-elected in 1878; the Red Shirts gave support but less {{violence}} was required. Two days later, he was thrown from a <b>mule</b> while <b>deer</b> hunting and broke his right leg. Several weeks later, his right leg was amputated due to complications arising from this injury.|$|R
50|$|The WMA {{is located}} along the Henry Fork of the Snake River and {{provides}} habitat for waterfowl and over 200 wildlife species. Large game {{that can be}} seen in the WMA include moose, elk, and <b>mule</b> and white-tailed <b>deer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The area {{is home to}} antelope, <b>mule</b> and whitetail <b>deer,</b> elk, {{black and}} grizzly bear, Rocky Mountain Goats, and bighorn sheep. Some moose also live in and along the nearby {{mountain}}s, as well as coyotes, wolves and mountain lions.|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} the high desert {{provides}} habitat for mammals such as pronghorn, coyote, <b>mule</b> <b>deer,</b> black-tailed jackrabbit, and cougar. Birds common in the region include sage grouse, California quail, and prairie falcon. The western juniper {{is the most common}} tree in the region, and big sagebrush and common woolly sunflower are the region's most widespread plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests and}} meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life {{including}} foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. <b>Mule</b> <b>deer</b> {{are the most}} common large mammals in the park. Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.|$|E

40|$|Trypanosoma evansi. T. equinum in South America is a dyskinetoplastic {{variant of}} T. evansi {{and not a}} {{separate}} species. Transmitted mechanically from infected blood of animals, and is not capable of cyclical development in tsetse Glossina spp. Morphologically indistinguishable from T. brucei. Resistance to physical and chemical action Chemicals/Disinfectants: Controlling arthropod vectors and preventing access to host species is important in preventing new infections. Disinfection does not prevent spread of disease (blood-borne parasite). One minute exposure to ultraviolet light prevents infection. Survival: Trypanosomes only survive short periods outside the host. T. evansi disappears quickly from the carcass after death. Flies no longer transmit the parasites after 8 hours. EPIDEMIOLOGY T. evansi has a wide host range. In some countries incidence of surra increases significantly furing the rainy season when biting fly populations have greatly increased. Surra affects mainly camels and horses but buffaloes and cattle are also affected. Other species that develop severe disease include donkeys, <b>mules,</b> <b>deer,</b> llamas, dogs, cats, cattle and buffalo. Sheep, goats, pigs and elephants may occasional develop mild or chronic disease. Camel raising in Africa and buffalo production in Asia are severely affected.

5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the <b>mule</b> <b>deer.</b> Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats {{that live in the}} North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include <b>mule</b> <b>deer,</b> coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser foliage, and <b>mule</b> <b>deer</b> sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
50|$|Many {{large mammals}} {{are present in}} the park, {{including}} grizzly and black bears, <b>mule</b> and whitetail <b>deer,</b> moose, mountain caribou, and mountain goats.

Except for the Laguna Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E

50|$|An acute {{form of the}} disease, {{which is}} {{generally}} fatal unless treated, occurs in horses, donkeys, <b>mules,</b> cattle, buffalo, <b>deer,</b> camels, llamas, dogs, and cats.

This form occurs in South America, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. This was the first form of pathogenic trypanosome discovered and was first described by Griffith Evans in 1880 while he was working in India.|$|R
