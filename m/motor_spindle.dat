This concept proposes an adaptronic high performance <b>motor</b> <b>spindle</b> integrating piezoelectric actuators and accelerometers combined with an optimal control strategy {{whose objective is to}} increase the productivity in chatter-free machining conditions. The control strategy, named stabilization, explicitly considers the cutting process in the controller synthesis in order to tailor the dynamics of the spindle according to the encountered machining conditions.

Therefore, the operators of the machines require long-term guarantees of availability and cost by the manufacturers.

40|$|AbstractOne {{key factor}} in {{designing}} a motor built-in high-speed <b>motor</b> <b>spindle</b> is to assemble the motor rotor and shaft by means of hot-fit. In a previous study, the optimization approach was recommended by introducing an equivalent local Young’s modulus characterizing the effects on the local stiffness of the shaft {{at the location of}} hot-fit. This approach, being based on the modal testing results, is a posterior improvement. In this paper, contact pressure between the rotor and the shaft is firstly calculated through contact theory. The stress state is thus determined. The contact element modal analysis then follows with the stress state as a pre-stressed condition. The effects of pre-stress are then adopted for subsequent contact element modal analysis. The accuracy and the validity of the finite element results are verified by modal testing. Finally, an equivalent direct modeling is suggested as an efficient alternative. This equivalent model is constructed with line elements and the model is created based on the results obtained from the contact element modal analysis. The results obtained from this study indicate that the equivalent direct model with line elements is accurate and efficient in analyzing the dynamic behavior of a rotary shaft system with hot-fit components...|$|E
40|$|The bobbin {{friction}} stir welding (BFSW) {{process has}} benefits for welding aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6 in the boat-building industry. However this alloy is difficult to weld in the thin state. There are {{a large number of}} process variables and covert situational factors that affect weld quality. This paper investigates how tool holder and machine-type affect BFSW weld quality of 4 [*]mm Al 6082 -T 6. The variables were tool features (three types), machine-controller type (two types), and tool holder (fixed versus floating). Fourier analysis was performed on <b>motor</b> <b>spindle</b> current to determine the frequency response of the machine. An interaction was found between the computer numerical control (CNC), the degrees of freedom of the tool holder, and the substrate (workpiece). The conventional idea that the welding tool has a semisteady interaction with the substrate is not supported. Instead the interaction is highly dynamic, and this materially affects the weld quality. Specific vibrational interactions are associated with poor welding. The CNC machine-type also emerges as a neglected variable that needs to be given attention in the selection of process parameters. Although compliance in the tool holder might seem useful, it is shown to have negative consequences as it introduces tool positioning problems...|$|E
40|$|In the {{representation}} of the machine tool’s manufacturing accuracy, involving thermo-elastic deformations in the tool and its chuck in the considerations is unavoidable, since a portion of the process heat is transmitted into the tool. Capture and estimation of the resultant thermo-elastic deformations is of significant importance for their compensation and correction. This paper presents the investigation and evaluation of thermo-elastic displacements in the tool-chuck system resulting from the heat flows from machining. The temperature and displacement measurements were conducted on a test bed with measuring equipment. In the first series of experiments, the transient heat conduction in the stationary tool and the chucking system, decoupled from the <b>motor</b> <b>spindle,</b> was captured. The chucks were compared in terms of their working principle. The identification of the thermal boundary and contact conditions was assisted by Finite Element models. The paper describes the experimental setups, the methods of measurement and the numerical models. An additional section discusses the determination of realistic heat sources generated in the machining process. Since measurement of these heat flows is either impossible or expensive and time-consuming, they are determined by numerical simulation of the machining process itself. This way, it can be determined to what extent the heat flows generated in the experiments by means of heating cartridge or induction correspond to those generated by the actual machining heat sources...|$|E
