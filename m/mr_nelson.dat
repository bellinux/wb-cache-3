The British Listed Building register {{sees it as a}} 're-surfaced' building of circa 1790. Adamson visited it in 1879 and records that it contained the rigid form of a monk, with shaven crown, chipped nose, and folded hands, lying on its back at the entrance. The building otherwise only contained a chair and a small table. The building was recently (2009) restored again and now has an interpretation board detailing its history and a trail guide indicates its location.|$|E

6000|$|HORATIO, son of Edmund and Catherine Nelson, {{was born}} September 29, 1758, in the parsonage-house of Burnham Thorpe, {{a village in}} the county of Norfolk, of which his father was rector. His mother was a {{daughter}} of Dr. Suckling, prebendary of Westminster, whose grandmother was sister of Sir Robert Walpole, and this child was named after his godfather, the first Lord Walpole. Mrs. Nelson died in 1767, leaving eight out of eleven children. Her brother, Captain Maurice Suckling, of the navy visited the widower upon this event, and promised {{to take care of}} one of the boys. Three years afterwards, when HORATIO was only twelve years of age, being at home during the Christmas holidays, he read in the county newspaper that his uncle was appointed to the RAISONNABLE, of sixty-four guns. [...] "Do, William," [...] said he to a brother who was {{a year and a half}} older than himself, [...] "write to my father, and tell him that I should like to go to sea with uncle Maurice." [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nelson</b> was then at Bath, whither he had gone for the recovery of his health: his circumstances were straitened, and he had no prospect of ever seeing them bettered: he knew that it was the wish of providing for himself by which Horatio was chiefly actuated, and did not oppose his resolution; he understood also the boy's character, and had always said, that in whatever station he might be placed, he would climb if possible to the very top of the tree. Captain Suckling was written to. [...] "What," [...] said he in his answer, [...] "has poor Horatio done, who is so weak, that he, above all the rest, should be sent to rough it out at sea?--But let him come; and the first time we go into action, a cannon-ball may knock off his head, and provide for him at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|The design {{against the}} Barbary pirates, {{like all other}} designs against them, was laid aside; and Nelson took his wife to his father's parsonage, meaning only to pay him a visit before they went to France; a project which he had formed {{for the sake of}} {{acquiring}} a competent knowledge of the French language. But his father could not bear to lose him thus unnecessarily. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nelson</b> had long been an invalid, suffering under paralytic and asthmatic affections, which, for several hours after he rose in the morning, scarcely permitted him to speak. He had been given over by his physicians for this complaint nearly forty years before his death; and was, for many of his latter years, obliged to spend all his winters at Bath. The sight of his son, he declared, had given him new life. [...] "But, Horatio," [...] said he, [...] "it would have been better that I had not been thus cheered, if I am so soon to be bereaved of you again. Let me, my good son, see you whilst I can. My age and infirmities increase, and I shall not last long." [...] To such an appeal there could be no reply. Nelson took up his abode at the parsonage, and amused himself with the sports and occupations of the country. Sometimes he busied himself with farming the glebe; sometimes spent the greater part of the day in the garden, where he would dig as if for the mere pleasure of wearying himself. Sometimes he went a birds'-nesting, like a boy; and in these expeditions Mrs. Nelson always, by his expressed desire, accompanied him. Coursing was his favourite amusement. Shooting, as he practised it, was far too dangerous for his companions; for he carried his gun upon the full cock, as if he were going to board an enemy; and the moment a bird rose, he let fly without ever putting the fowling-piece to his shoulder. It is not, therefore, extraordinary that his having once shot a partridge should be remembered by his family among the remarkable events of his life.|$|E

60|$|On the 15th 500 mounted Boers {{entered the}} town. On the 16th {{fighting}} began in earnest, and the firing was hot on both sides. A very heavy fire was kept {{up on the}} prison and court-house. Half an hour after it commenced Captain Falls was killed. For the next sixty hours the firing continued, night and day, {{and one of the}} little garrison was killed and nine wounded. During the night the Boers broke into a stable close to the court-house, and from a distance of eight yards a heavy fire was kept up. During this time Colonel Winsloe in the fort had given what aid he could to the garrison of the courthouse by shelling the building from which the Dutch were firing upon it. On the evening of the 17th he signalled to the garrison to retire on the fort; but, being completely surrounded, they were unable to do this. On the morning of the 18th the Boers attempted to set fire to the thatch roof of the court-house; and as nothing in that case could have saved the garrison, Major Clarke and Commandant Raaff agreed to surrender on the terms that the lives of all those in the court-house should be spared. This was agreed to; but two loyal Boers, who had been captured at an outpost, were tried, condemned to death, and shot. On the 21st of December the garrison of the prison, falling short of provisions, evacuated it, and succeeded in gaining the fort without loss. The Boers occupied the post, but were driven out by the shell-fire from the fort. <b>Mr</b> <b>Nelson,</b> the magistrate, was taken prisoner in the town by the Boers, and kept in close confinement. Three of his sons got into the fort, and took part in its defence. Two of them, on a dark night, on the 19th of February, got through the Boer lines, and carried despatches from Colonel Winsloe to Newcastle, arriving there on the 5th of March, after many perils, {{not the least of which}} was swimming the Vaal River when in full flood.|$|E
6000|$|In placing this tract {{second in}} chronological order I am {{following}} Forster and Craik. All the collected editions of Swift's works, including the [...] "Miscellanies" [...] of 1711, begin with [...] "The Sentiments of a Church of England Man," [...] continue with the [...] "Argument," [...] and then the [...] "Project." [...] But the short intervals which separated the publication of all three tracts and the [...] "Letter on the Sacramental Test," [...] make a strict chronological order of less value than the order of development of the subject-matter with which they deal, granting even that the [...] "Project" [...] appeared after [...] "The Sentiments." [...] There seems, however, nothing improbable in the suggestion made by Forster, that Swift planned the writing of both the [...] "Argument" [...] and the [...] "Project" [...] while {{on a visit to}} the Earl of Berkeley, at Cranford, in 1708; and his dedication of the latter to Lady Berkeley lends this suggestion added weight. That the original edition of the [...] "Project" [...] is dated 1709 is nothing to the point, since it is well-known that the booksellers often antedated their publications, as publishers do now, when the issue occurred towards the end of a year. Moreover, the letter of the Earl of Berkeley to Swift, which Scott misdates 1706-1707, but which should be 1708, makes special reference to this very tract, showing that it was certainly published in 1708. [...] "I earnestly entreat you," [...] writes the earl, [...] "if you have not done it already, that you would not fail of having your bookseller enable the Archbishop of York [Dr. Sterne] to give a book to the queen; for, with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nelson,</b> I am entirely of opinion, that Her Majesty's reading of that book on the Progress for the Increase of Morality and Piety, may be of very great use to that end." [...] I have never seen a copy of the first edition of [...] "The Sentiments," [...] and I cannot fix the exact date of its publication; but it was certainly not written before the [...] "Project." [...] The [...] "Project," [...] therefore, must be considered in the light of a preliminary essay to the fuller and more digested statement of [...] "The Sentiments of a Church of England man"; and I have, on this account, placed it as the second tract written by Swift in the year 1708.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{purchased}} {{a house and}} estate at Merton, in Surrey, meaning to pass his days there in the society of Sir William and Lady Hamilton. He had indulged in pleasant dreams when looking on to this as his place of residence and rest. [...] "To be sure," [...] he says, [...] "we shall employ the tradespeople of our village in preference to any others in what we want for common use, and give them every encouragement to be kind and attentive to us." [...] "Have we a nice church at Merton? We will set an example of goodness to the under-parishioners. I admire the pigs and poultry. Sheep are certainly most beneficial to eat off the grass. Do you get paid for them, and take care that they are kept on the premises all night, for that is the time they do good to the land. They should be folded. Is your head-man a good person, and true to our interest? I intend to have a farming-book. I expect that all animals will increase where you are, for I never expect that you will suffer any to be killed. No person can take amiss our not visiting. The answer from me will always be very civil thanks, but that I wish to live retired. We shall have our sea-friends; and I know Sir William thinks they are the best." [...] This place {{he had never seen}} till he was now welcomed there by the friends to whom he had so passionately devoted himself, and who were not less sincerely attached to him. The place, and everything which Lady Hamilton had done to it, delighted him; and he declared that the longest liver should possess it all. Here he amused himself with angling in the Wandle, having been a good fly-fisher in former days, and learning now to practise with his left hand what he could no longer pursue as a solitary diversion. His pensions for his victories, and for the loss of his eye and arm, amounted with his half-pay to about L3400 a-year. From this he gave L1800 to Lady Nelson, L200 to a brother's widow, and L150 for the education of his children; and he paid L500 interest for borrowed money; so that Nelson was comparatively a poor man; and though much of the pecuniary embarrassment which he endured was occasioned by the separation from his wife--even if that cause had not existed, his income would not have been sufficient for the rank which he held, and the claims which would necessarily be made upon his bounty. The depression of spirits under which he had long laboured arose partly from this state of his circumstances, and partly from the other disquietudes in which his connection with Lady Hamilton had involved him--a connection which it was not possible his father could behold without sorrow and displeasure. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nelson,</b> however, was soon persuaded that the attachment, which Lady Nelson regarded with natural jealousy and resentment, did not in reality pass the bounds of ardent and romantic admiration: a passion which the manners and accomplishments of Lady Hamilton, fascinating as they were, {{would not have been able}} to excite, if they had not been accompanied by more uncommon intellectual endowments, and by a character which, both in its strength and in its weakness, resembled his own. It did not, therefore, require much explanation to reconcile him to his son--an event the more essential to Nelson's happiness, because, a few months afterwards, the good old man died at the age of seventy-nine.|$|E
