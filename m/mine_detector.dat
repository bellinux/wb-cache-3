25|$|On 23 October the Eighth Army under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery counter-attacked at the Second Battle of El Alamein. For {{the first}} phase, the aptly-named Operation Lightfoot, {{the key was}} to breach the {{extensive}} German minefields during the night to allow the armour formations to pass through and exploit {{the success of the}} initial bombardment and infantry assault. For this work the sappers were trained to use the recently arrived Polish <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> (<b>Mine</b> <b>detector</b> Mark I). X Corps organised a Minefield Task Force for each of its armoured divisions: 571st Field Company was attached to 10th Armoured Division, and both 572nd and 573rd Fd Cos were with 1st Armoured Division, while 570th Fd Park Co remained with X Corps HQ.|$|E
25|$|On March 23, Task Force Growdon, {{which was}} {{completely}} motorized, {{passed through the}} ROK 1st Division shortly after 07:00. No Chinese forces opposed the armored column as it moved ahead of the South Koreans, but within minutes the third tank in column hit a mine while bypassing a destroyed bridge at the small Changnung River. The task force was held up while engineers removed a dozen other mines from the bypass. Proceeding slowly from that point with a <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> team leading the way afoot, Colonel Growdon's column moved only a mile {{to the village of}} Sinwon-ni before encountering more mines. When the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team began landing at Munsan-ni at 09:00, Growdon's task force was at a halt some fifteen miles (24km) to the south.|$|E
2500|$|Metal {{detectors}} {{were first}} used, after their invention by the Polish officer Józef Kosacki. Allies used his invention, {{known as the}} Polish <b>mine</b> <b>detector,</b> to clear the German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein when 500 units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery. The [...] "Polish" [...] <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> was later used together with the ERA mine-locator for detecting beach mines.|$|E
5000|$|To {{enable the}} mines {{to be found}} by {{friendly}} forces, the mines were painted with a black sandy substance called [...] (camouflage sand). Allied forces found that although the mines were undetectable by Allied <b>mine</b> <b>detectors,</b> German <b>mine</b> <b>detectors</b> could find the mines when they had been marked with Tarnsand. [...] The secret of Tarnsand was maintained until {{after the end of}} the war, when it was discovered that it was a mildly radioactive substance and the German <b>mine</b> <b>detectors</b> incorporated a simple Geiger counter.|$|R

50|$|Józef Stanisław Kosacki (1909-1990) was a Polish {{professor}} engineer, inventor, and {{an officer}} in the Polish Army during World War II. He is best known as the inventor of the Polish <b>mine</b> <b>detector,</b> the first man-portable <b>mine</b> <b>detector,</b> whose basic design has been in use with various armies for over 50 years.|$|E
50|$|He was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} <b>mine</b> <b>detectors</b> military unit 859 on 7 March 1992 and freed the villages of Aranzəmin, Pirjamal and Dəhrəz from Armenian occupation.|$|R

The role of Vallon Man is one of the most dangerous in the fighting in Afghanistan, as Vallon men are often killed in their work.|$|E

50|$|The Bakelite {{anti-tank}} mine type I and type II were Italian {{anti-tank mine}}s produced during the Second World War.
