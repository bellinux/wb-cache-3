40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} of grammatical relations' marking that combines the advances of <b>monolingual</b> <b>analysis</b> with cross-linguistic comparison. It examines adpositions as grammatical relations' markers and the linguistic change {{which leads to the}} rise of adpositional objects from freely insertable spatial adverbials. Th is study concentrates on the Finnish adposition perään 'after'. An empirical <b>monolingual</b> corpus <b>analysis</b> shows that perään as a grammatical relations' marker is a productive device for argument linking in contemporary Finnish. In a cross-linguistic comparison, the properties of Swedish, German and Finnish adpositional objects with efter, nach and perään 'after, are studied with regard to the continuum between prototypical freely insertable adverbials and prototypical adpositional objects. A diachronic comparison, in turn, focuses on the development of adpositional objects from spatial adverbials and examines three alternative possibilities for perään: native grammaticalization, contact-induced grammaticalization and the interaction of both language-internal and -external factors...|$|R

40|$|Testing {{concurrent}} programs {{remains a}} difficult task due to the non-deterministic nature of concurrent executions. Many approaches have been proposed to combine static and dynamic analysis to reduce the complexity of uncovering potential concurrency bugs. However, the existing collaboration schemes only provide a limited mechanism for exchanging relevant information between the two analyses. For example, alias information only flows from the static <b>analysis</b> <b>module</b> to the dynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>module</b> {{at the beginning of}} the dynamic analysis. Therefore, we cannot fully exploit the advantages of each type of analysis. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we present a new testing technique which enables a tighter collaboration between static analysis and dynamic analysis. In this collaboration scheme, static analysis and dynamic analysis interact iteratively throughout the whole testing process. Static analysis uses coarse-grained analysis to guide the dynamic analysis to concentrate on the relevant search space, while dynamic analysis collects concrete runtime information during the guided exploration. The runtime information provided by the dynamic analysis helps the static analysis to refine its coarse-grained analysis and provides better guidance on dynamic analysis. Currently, our implementation consists of a static <b>analysis</b> <b>module</b> based on Soot and a dynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>module</b> based on JPF (Java PathFinder) ...|$|R
