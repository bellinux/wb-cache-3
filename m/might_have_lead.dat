5000|$|During {{this time}} period {{the power of the}} papacy had {{declined}} and most of the popes of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries found themselves either fleeing Rome or not allowed to enter at all. Also at this time antipopes backed by the German Emperors were common fixtures in the Emperors' bitter struggle with the Church. One of the last thirteenth century popes was Peter Morrone, an old man selected to be pope as a compromise, who as Pope Celestine V proved too old and too ineffective to rule the Church and upon realizing this himself, he abdicated. This caused a tremendous protest throughout the western Church and had a divisive effect on the next pope, Boniface VIII. Pope Boniface was in many ways the opposite of his predecessor in that he was very capable, determined and even bold, but many held that a pope could not abdicate and that Celestine remained the true pope. Boniface in turn captured the old pope, who had sought nothing more than to retire in peace, imprisoning him until his death in 1296. Boniface VIII continued to impose his control on secular authorities, Edward I of England and Philip IV of France, who both protested against his authority, but Philip IV of France proved his most formidable opponent. Philip attempted to tax the church which Boniface refused, beginning a long series of struggles between the two. Finally in 1303 Guillaume de Nogaret, Philip IV's lawyer drew up a list of 29 charges including black magic, sodomy, heresy and blasphemy against Pope Boniface. In turn Boniface announced that he intended to place the kingdom of France under interdict. This threat to Philip <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>lead</b> to revolution so de Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna leading a force of 1600 men attacked Anagni, where the pope was in residence, captured Boniface and for three days held him prisoner. After four days however the residents of Anagni rose up and expelled the invaders and took Boniface to Rome in triumph. But the ordeal had been too much for the 86‑year‑old pope and he died days later. Philip IV was determined not to have a pope interfere with his plans again and after a year the conclave was still unable to decide so an outsider was suggested in the person of Bernard de Goth, Archbishop of Bordeaux. He had been a supporter of Boniface but Philip arranged a meeting promising to support him as pope if he would certain conditions including reconciliations between France and the Church and absolution for any of Philip's men who had fought and captured Boniface. [...] Bernard de Goth became Pope Clement V on 14 November 1305.|$|E

A network generator is considered to be synthesizing realistic networks if a topological comparison between the synthesized and real networks is, with high likelihood, statistically similar across a subset of user-desired topological characteristics. In this way, the objective isn’t to exactly replicate the topology of a given real-world network because there is no utility in synthesizing isomorphic networks as it provides no additional insights. Further, given the input is a single SCN observation, strong assumptions about the dynamical growth of the network need to be made, and the network generator needs to be robust to any such assumptions. Finally, the parameters of the optimized network generator should ideally provide additional insights into the local decisions of the firms that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>lead</b> to creation of the observed network topology.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. A {{revolution}} in genetic research, {{known as the}} Human Genome Project (HGP), is taking place. This project, initiated in 1984, is a twenty-year, six billion-dollar science project designed to map the entire genetic structure (Genome) {{of the human species}} (Brockett and Tankersley, 1995). In 1998, the HGP leaders expected to complete the project by 2003 (Lowden, J. A., 1999 : 33). The Human Genome Project is designed to sequence the human genome (the blue print of genetic information) and to identify the estimated 100000 genesherein. This has added a new dimension to the technology available to underwriters in the life and health insurance industry for the selection of medical risks. Genetic testing can identify inherited diseases and predict illnesses that might not manifest for decades (Brackenridge & Elder, 1998 : 89). Genome research has opened up new opportunities for diagnosis and in some cases, early treatment of medical conditions. This new basis of knowledge {{is referred to as the}} advent of the molecular age in medicine. Medical journals, the mass media and genetic interest groups are treating human genetics and the opportunities it presents as a high-profile issue, with great attention being paid to the complex and emotive topics of life insurance and genetic testing (Regenauer & Schmidtke, 1998 : 5). The Insurance Industry can use genetic testing to identify high-risk applicants more accurately and price products accordingly, thereby improving risk assessment and profitability. These potential advantages, however, are counter-balanced by ethical considerations that are much more difficult to address (Lowden, J. A., 1999 : 33). Many consumers, ethicists and geneticists fear that insurers will use this data for unfair discriminatory purposes, identifying a genetic underclass of people who, although clinically well, will be uninsurable. Genetic testing could invade the privacy of applicants and their families. There are concerns about the confidential handling of genetic information as well as the accurate interpretation of genetic tests. The uncertainty about the predictive value of genetic tests, the shortage of trained geneticists and counsellors and the psychological impact of that knowledge of a predictable serious disease <b>might</b> <b>have,</b> <b>have</b> <b>lead</b> to much opposition to the use of genetic information by third parties. In the United States most Americans receive health insurance through their place of employment. There are fears that genetic testing will be used to discriminate against prospective employees and render many people unemployable and uninsurable (Council for responsible Genetics, 1997 : [URL] htuil Consumer groups have lobbied effectively for the prohibition of testing or the use of testing by insurers in the United States and Europe and legislators aim to ban the use of genetic information on a broad basis. Insurers, on the other hand, are assuming that the new laws will cause untold damage to the fiscal stability of their companies (Lowden, J. A., 1999 : 33). However, it seems inevitable that genetic testing will affect risk classification sooner rather than later and to a greater extent than most believe (Chambers, 1997 : [URL]...|$|R

Staffell remembers: [...] "As I recall, it went like this - Colin Petersen played drums, I played bass at first, but was crap, so we used, I think, Rick Kemp from Steeleye Span a couple of times. Jonathan Kelly played guitar and wrote the songs, and I have an idea that Tim Renwick from Quiver <b>might</b> <b>have</b> played <b>lead</b> once or twice, and we had Peter Wood on keyboards (Quiver, Sutherland Brothers).
