Pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department.

50|$|The {{stock was}} divided into two pools: A 'main line stock' pool {{composing}} 263 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 248 trailers. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were the 101 new <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> together with all the C, D, E and G Stock motor and trailers; these all received new motors. These ran with 248 trailers of the wooden B Stock, 152 of these <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with the <b>motors</b> removed. A small pool of 'local stock', 37 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 18 control trailers worked the Acton Town shuttles to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.

5|$|When {{delivery}} of C67 stock began in 1977, {{two pairs of}} CO/CP stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> to shunt the new stock at Ruislip Depot, and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units. The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot, as it was commissioned at Ruislip. The D78 stock was different, in that delivery was still to Ruislip, but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot, and therefore pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were needed to transfer the stock. Two pairs of CO/CP stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were allocated {{to do this in}} 1979, with a further three pairs joining them in 1980. New trains were transferred with a pilot <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> at each end, as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping. The pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> carried large stencils at both ends, so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete. Three pairs of R stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> after the R stock was scrapped. Most of the surface stock pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were scrapped when the deliveries were complete, although one each of the CO/CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved.|$|R

50|$|The track layout {{within the}} station {{does not allow}} for the usual method of running the <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> round the trailer ready for the return journey. Instead the trailer car is {{detached}} from the <b>motor</b> <b>car,</b> and the <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> crosses over to the opposing track. The trailer is then allowed to roll down under gravity {{to the end of the}} line, where the <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> will reverse back onto it and be coupled up again.|$|R
25|$|Not {{counting}} the two Composite prototypes, the IRT received 500 Composites: 340 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 160 trailers. Estimates by IRT engineers required a 3:1 ratio of <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> to trailer cars. Therefore, when the 300 Gibbs Hi-V motors {{were added to}} these numbers, the new totals were 640 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 160 trailers. This was a surplus of <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> Shortly after delivery, therefore, the IRT began converting <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> into trailers. As all Gibbs Hi-V <b>cars</b> were <b>motors,</b> the preference was to keep them that way while converting more Composite motors into trailers. By 1910, 208 of the 340 motorized Composite cars had been converted into trailers.|$|R

50|$|The line {{took over}} five <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> from the Lockwitztal tramway in 1977, after {{the closure of}} that line. These {{vehicles}} were built between 1938 and 1944 for the tramway of Erfurt, and are thus called Erfurter. In 1984, four trailers built by Gothaer Waggonfabrik in the 1960s were acquired, and these were joined by two similar <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> in 1992, two <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and two trailers in 1995 and a final <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> in 2007. These vehicles came from various East German cities, and are collectively known as Gothawagen.|$|R
50|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> {{are divided}} into two {{distinct}} types, the 'A' end car and the 'D' end car. Each of the bogies fitted to the two cars are identical. This means that if the two <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> at the two ends of a train were identical, they would attempt to pull the train in opposite directions. Consequently, the bogies on the 'D' end <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> are installed {{the other way around}} from those on the 'A' end causing the two <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> to move the train in the same direction.|$|R

5|$|While single {{passenger}} cars were sometimes {{moved around the}} system, either between depots or to Acton Works, these movements were infrequent, {{and when they were}} necessary, standard stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used.
