40|$|AIMS—To compare tritan colour {{contrast}} sensitivity (CCS), without and with glare, {{in patients with}} refractive multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) and with monofocal intraocular lenses.  METHODS—Tritan CCS was determined (Moorfields Vision System, CH Electronics) in 15  eyes (14  patients, 75. 7  (± 6. 6) years) with a refractive multifocal IOL (Allergan SA 40 N) and in 11  eyes (10  patients, 73. 7  (± 6. 4) years) with a monofocal IOL (Allergan SI 40  NB). Measurements were made monocularly under mesopic conditions {{at a distance of}} 2  metres from the monitor with best distance refraction plus 0. 5  D at 0. 5,  1,  3,  6,  11. 4, and 22. 8  cycles per degree (cpd). The test was then repeated for the multifocal IOLs, adding minus 2. 5  D to the best distance refraction to force the patient to use the near focus. Both lenses were also investigated under glare conditions with the same set-up and using the brightness acuity tester (BAT).  RESULTS—The tritan CCS function without glare in multifocal lenses through the distance focus was nearly identical to that through the near focus. The following statistically significant differences were measured: the CCS function without glare for the multifocal lens was worse at 0. 5  cpd and 1. 0  cpd than that of the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens.</b> In CCS testing of the multifocal group with glare at 6  cpd, the results through the distance focus were better than the results through the near focus. For the CCS function with glare, the values for the distance focus in the multifocal lens were worse than the values for the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens</b> at 0. 5  cpd and 1  cpd. In CCS testing with glare through the near focus and CCS testing through the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens,</b> the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens</b> performed better at 0. 5  cpd, 1  cpd, 3  cpd, and 6  cpd.  CONCLUSION—Refractive multifocal intraocular lenses influence tritan CCS function compared to monofocal lenses. ...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{calculate}} {{the diameter of}} halos perceived by patients with multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) and to stimulate halos in patients with refractive multifocal IOLs in a clinical experiment.  METHODS—Calculations were done to show the diameter of halos {{in the case of}} the bifocal intraocular lens. 24  patients with a refractive multifocal IOLs and five patients with a monofocal IOL were asked about their subjective observation of halos and were included in a clinical experiment using a computer program (Glare & Halo, FW Fitzke and C Lohmann, Tomey AG) which simulates a light source of 0. 15  square degrees (sq deg) in order to stimulate and measure halos. Halo testing took place monoculary, under mesopic conditions through the distance and the near focus of the multifocal lens and through the focus of the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens.</b>  RESULTS—The halo diameter depends on the pupil diameter, the refractive power of the cornea, and distance focus of the multifocal IOL as well as the additional lens power for the near focus. 23  out of 24  patients with a refractive multifocal IOL described halos at night when looking at a bright light source. Only one patient was disturbed by the appearance of halos. Under test conditions, halos were detected in all patients with a refractive multifocal IOL. The halo area testing through the distance focus was 1. 05  sq deg ±  0. 41, through the near focus 1. 07  sq deg ±  0. 49  and in the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens</b> 0. 26  sq deg ±  0. 13.  CONCLUSIONS—Under high contrast conditions halos can be stimulated in all patients with multifocal intraocular lenses. The halo size using the distance or the near focus is identical. ...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the crystalline lenses were studied {{in a variety of}} large predatory teleosts (bony fishes) that forage in the open ocean, some of them at considerable depths. We found the first fish lenses that are free of measurable longitudinal spherical aberration, i. e., are perfectly monofocal, in contrast to the multifocal lenses that are typical for smaller fishes living close to the surface. In fact, none of the lenses investigated in this study were clearly multifocal. Most, but not all, of the lenses had long normalized focal lengths (focal length/lens radius) of up to 3. 3 lens radii.

40|$|The {{following}} paper compares contrast sensitivity, glare, post-operational visual acuity, independency {{of glasses}} and patient satisfaction of {{three groups of}} patients with regards to three types of interocular lenses: multifocal lenses Acrysof ReSTOR SN 60 D 3 with blue filter (19 patients), aspheric <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> without blue filter AMO Tecnis Z 9002 (21 patients) and <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> with blue light filter Alcon AcrySof IQ Aspheric - SN 60 WF (21 patients). The inclusion criterion {{for this study was}} that patients have only a cataract and no pathological ailments. In regards to contrast sensitivity, patients tested with aspheric <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> with blue filter SN 60 WF had better results than patients with aspheric <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> without blue filter Z 9002 and with multifocal lenses with blue filter ReSTOR. These differences however were not significant and did not affect patient satisfaction. This study shows that a blue filter can have a positive influence on the contrast sensitivity under photopic and mesopic conditions. Post-operational tests show that, in contrast to most of the patients with <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> the patients who had multifocal implants could read without the help of glasses. The potential uncorrected visual acuity of patients of monfocal lenses was very good. The best acuity with correction was good for all patients The success rate of patients who did not need glasses was 6 % by <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> however 72 % by multifocal lenses ReSTOR. By almost all cases of monofocal lense implants there was, as expected, a deficit in uncorrected near vision of Nieden 4 and 6. The examination of patients with multifocal lenses ReSTOR made of Acryl with asymmetrical distribution of light proves to be an effective lense, which allows patients, after having a cataract operation to live a “life without glasses. ” Patients who choose this lense type must then be willing to accept that there are some disadvantages, particularly with regards to contrast sensitivity, glare and a small reduction in visual acuity. So, currently, after appropriate consultation, the multifocal blue filter lenses with diffractive optic is considered to be an effective solution to lense replacement in cases of cataracts as well as refractive lense surgery...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:Providing an {{objective}} and subjective evaluation of life quality and satisfaction {{level of the}} patients who underwent cataract surgery with implant of bifocal, multifocal and <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses.</b> Methods:Bifocal lenses were implanted in 72 patients, aspheric multifocal lenses in 16 patients, apodized multifocal lenses in 20 patients and <b>Monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> were implanted in 63 patients. The patients answered a 47 question questionnaire, whose results were evaluated and analyzed. Results:The level of satisfaction of the patients implanted with bifocal and multifocal lenses {{was significantly higher than}} of those with <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> (kruskal - Wallis test, p< 0. 001 followed by the Dunn test, p< 0. 05). As to the comparison of <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> with bifocal and multifocal lenses, the near vision without correction was considerably lower in patients with <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> (Z test p< 0. 001). The patients with <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> without correction presented a much lower capacity of reading newspapers or books and as far as manual work than the ones with bifocal and multifocal lenses (Z test, p< 0. 001). Conclusion:The result of this study shows that the patients who received the bifocal and multifocal lenses had a remarkable improvement in their visual acuity for the near vision, being pleased with their general vision without wearing glasses. This is because they were able to read books and newspapers, write checks, fill out forms, do sports, shave or put on make-up, hence having high quality of life without correction. Objetivo:Fornecer uma avaliação objetiva e subjetiva da qualidade de vida e o nível de satisfação de pacientes que se submeteram à cirurgia de catarata, com implante de lentes bifocais, multifocais e monofocais. Métodos:Lentes bifocais foram implantadas em 72 pacientes; lentes multifocais asférica em 16 pacientes; lentes multifocais apodizada em 20 pacientes e lentes monofocais em 63 pacientes. Foi aplicado um questionário de 47 perguntas cujos resultados foram avaliados e analisados. Resultados:O nível de satisfação dos pacientes implantados com lentes bifocais e multifocais foi significantemente mais alto do que aqueles com lentes monofocais (teste Kruskal-Wallis p< 0, 01, seguido do teste Dunn, p< 0, 05). Quanto à comparação de lentes monofocais com lentes bifocais e multifocais, a visão para perto sem correção foi consideravelmente mais baixa em pacientes com lentes monofocais (teste Z, p< 0, 001). Os pacientes com lentes monofocais sem correção apresentaram uma menor capacidade de ler jornais ou livros e no que diz respeito a trabalhos manuais do que aqueles com lentes bifocais e multifocais (teste Z, p< 0, 001). Conclusão:Os resultados deste estudo mostram que os pacientes que receberam as lentes bifocais e multifocais tiveram uma melhora notável em sua acuidade visual para perto, estando satisfeitos com sua visão geral, sem óculos. A satisfação foi atribuída ao fato de conseguirem ler livros e jornais, preencher cheques, preencher formulários, praticar esportes, se barbear ou se maquiar sem correção.

40|$|The spherical {{crystalline}} lenses in {{the eyes}} of many fish species are well-suited models for studies on how natural selection has influenced the evolution of the optical system. Many of these lenses exhibit multiple focal lengths when illuminated with monochromatic light. Similar multifocality is present in a majority of vertebrate eyes, and it is assumed to compensate for the defocusing effect of longitudinal chromatic aberration. In order to identify potential optical advantages of multifocal lenses, we studied their information transfer capacity by computer mod-eling. We investigated four lens types: the lens of Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid fish species, an equiva-lent <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens,</b> and two artificial multifocal lenses. These lenses were combined with three detector arrays of different spectral properties: the cone photoreceptor system of A. burtoni and two artificial arrays. The optical properties compared between the lenses were longitudinal spherical aberration curves, point spread functions, modulation transfer functions, and imaging characteristics. The multifocal lenses had a better balance between spatial and spectral information than the monofocal lenses. Additionally, the lens and detector array had to be matched to each other for optimal function. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 330. 0330, 330. 1070. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{a typical}} fish eye, the {{crystalline}} lens {{is the only}} refractive element. It is spherical in shape and has high refractive power. Most fish species have elaborate color vision and spectral sensitivity may range from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet. Longitudinal chromatic aberration exceeds depth of focus and chromatic blur is compensated for by species-specific multifocality of the lens. The complex optical properties of fish lenses are subject to accurate regulation, including circadian reversible adjustments and irreversible developmental tuning. The mechanisms optimize the transfer of visual information to the retina in diverse and variable environments, and allow for rapid evolutionary changes in color vision. Active optical tuning of the lens is achieved by changes in the refractive index gradient and involves layers of mature, denucleated lens fiber cells. First steps have been taken toward unraveling the signaling systems controlling lens optical plasticity. Multifocal lenses compensating for chromatic blur are common in all major groups of vertebrates, including birds and mammals. Furthermore, the optical quality of a <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens,</b> {{such as in the}} human eye, is equally sensitive to the exact shape of the refractive index profile.

40|$|Purpose: A {{randomized}} and double-blinded {{study design}} was implemented {{to assess the}} stereo-acuity in patients symmetrically implanted with four types of multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs), compared to a <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens</b> (control group). In addition, {{the influence of the}} type of test employed for the evaluation of stereo-acuity was explored.; Materials and Methods: Six months after cataract intervention, stereo-acuity was measured with the Titmus and TNO stereotests in 143 patients implanted with one of the following MIOL lens types: hybrid spherical SN 60 D 3, hybrid aspheric SN 6 AD 1, diffractive aspheric ZMA 00 and refractive spherical NXG 1. A control group implanted with the monofocal aspheric ZA 9003 (in which stereo-acuity was measured with a near addition) was also included in the study.; Results: Statistically significant better stereo-acuity was found in the monofocal group with both stereotests (except for the SN 60 D 3 group with the Titmus test) (all p< 0. 001). No significant differences in stereo-acuity between MIOLs were found using the Titmus test. However, with the TNO, patients implanted with hybrid diffractive MIOLs exhibited statistically significant worse stereo-acuity than those with the refractive design (SN 60 D 3, p< 0. 001; SN 6 AD 1, p = 0. 006).; Conclusions: Patients implanted with MIOLs have worse stereo-acuity than those implanted with monofocal IOLs due to the decrease in retinal image contrast originating in the simultaneous presence of two images. Awavelength-based stereotest such as the TNO induces large differences in image contrast between fellow eyes implanted with diffractive-based MIOLs, which may result in an underestimation of the real stereo-acuity of the patient.

40|$|Background: With recent {{advances}} in technology and introduction of new intraocular lens (IOL) models, surgeons today {{have the opportunity to}} choose from various optical designs, which can influence the postoperative quality of vision. In our laboratory study, we compared the optical quality of three different IOLs that use the identical platform and are produced by the same manufacturer. The study included two diffractive multifocal IOLs, a bifocal and a trifocal one, as well as a monofocal IOL. Methods: Three IOL models: monofocal CT ASPHINA 409  M, diffractive bifocal AT LISA 809  M, and diffractive trifocal AT LISA Tri 839 MP (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany) were assessed for optical quality by measuring modulation transfer function (MTF) and Strehl Ratio (SR) values at pupil sizes of 3. 0 and 4. 5  mm on the OptiSpheric® IOL PRO (Trioptics GmbH, Germany). The United States Air Force (USAF) Target images were also recorded to comfirm the optical performance qualitatively. Results: For far focus at 50 lp/mm and 3. 0  mm pupil size, MTF value of the <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens</b> (MTF =  0. 798) was 1. 8 -fold and 2. 1 -fold better than the bifocal (MTF =  0. 446) and the trifocal (MTF =  0. 382) IOLs, respectively. For near focus, bifocal IOL (MTF =  0. 265) was 1. 4 -fold better than trifocal IOL (MTF =  0. 187), while for intermediate focus, the trifocal IOL (MTF =  0. 148) was 1. 7 -fold better than the bifocal IOL (MTF =  0. 086). For the same pupil size, total sum of light loss amounted to 5. 2 % for the monofocal, 16. 0 % for the bifocal and 6. 0 % for the trifocal IOL. For a larger pupil, the amount of light loss increased significantly for the multifocal IOLs. Conclusions: The monofocal IOL performed the best for far, the bifocal IOL for near and the trifocal IOL for intermediate focus. While the monofocal IOL created the least amount of light loss for both pupil sizes, the trifocal IOL created less than half the amount of light loss than the bifocal IOL for small pupil. For large pupil, however, less light scatter was observed for the bifocal than the trifocal IOL...|$|E
40|$|Vision is an {{important}} source of information for many animals. The lens plays {{a central role in the}} visual pathway and hence the ecology of these animals. Fish have spherically shaped crystalline lenses that contain a gradient of refractive index. Like all refracting elements, lens performance depends on the wavelength of the refracted light. This wavelength dependent focusing leads to chromatic aberration where only one wavelength interval is being focused correctly. Fish lenses compensate for this by dividing the lens into multiple concentric zones each responsible for focusing a particular wavelength interval. In this thesis I explore the optical and visual benefits these multifocal lenses offer. In order to minimize light scattering by the lens, all cells except the lens periphery are devoid of nuclei and cell organelles. Interestingly, the refractive index of this outer most zone is constant, maintaining a physiologically stable environment for these cells to function (Paper I). It has been shown that light or dark-adapting fish change their lenses’ properties within hours while fish reared under differently colored artificial light regimes do so after several months. I explored the effects of the light regimes found in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea on lenses of the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus. Such natural spectral differences affected the mean focal length of the lenses making the Mediterranean fish eyes more light sensitive than those found in the Red Sea population (Paper II). This coincides well with the darker and tinted waters found in the Mediterranean. Dispersion describes the wavelength dependency refractive media have. I therefore described a dispersion model that fitted measured refractive indices of various ocular media as well as the longitudinal chromatic aberration determined by laser scanning of fish lenses (Paper III). Relying on the results of the previous papers (Paper I & III), I compared multifocal fish lenses to a simplified <b>monofocal</b> <b>lens.</b> The multifocal lenses showed to be superior to monofocal ones. While monofocal lenses perfectly focus one wavelength, the short focal length in combination with the chromatic aberration these fish lenses have degrades the image at all other wavelengths. This results in an image relatively rich in spatial information (i. e. high contrast and sharp edges) but no spectral integrity (wrong hues and bland colors). Multifocal lenses offer an optimal trade off between spatial and spectral information (Paper IV) ...|$|E

50|$|Cataract surgery may be {{performed}} to correct vision problems in both eyes, {{and in these}} cases, patients are usually advised to consider monovision.

Although most patients can adjust to having implanted <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> in both eyes, some cannot and may experience blurred vision at both near and far distances. IOLs that emphasize distance vision may be mixed with IOLs that emphasize intermediate vision in order to achieve a type of modified monovision. Bausch and Lomb developed in 2004 the first aspheric IOLs which provide better contrast sensitivity by having their periphery flatter than the middle of the lens. However, some cataract surgeons have debated the benefits of aspheric IOLs, because the contrast sensitivity benefit may not last in older patients.|$|R

50|$|Intraocular lens (IOL) is a lens {{implanted}} in the eye {{as part of a}} treatment for cataracts or myopia. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens, and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia, or nearsightedness. IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Good unaided {{distance}} {{visual acuity}} {{is now a}} realistic expectation following cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Near vision, however, still requires additional refractive power, usually {{in the form of}} reading glasses. Multiple optic (multifocal) IOLs are available which claim to allow good vision at a range of distances. It is unclear whether this benefit outweighs the optical compromises inherent in multifocal IOLs. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of multifocal IOLs, including effects on visual acuity, subjective visual satisfaction, spectacle dependence, glare and contrast sensitivity, compared to standard <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> in people undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register), The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www. controlled-trials. com), ClinicalTrials. gov (www. clinicaltrials. gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www. who. int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 6 March 2012. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted investigators of included studies and manufacturers of multifocal IOLs for information about additional published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing a multifocal IOL of any type with a monofocal IOL as control were included. Both unilateral and bilateral implantation trials were included. Data collection and analysis: Two authors collected data and assessed trial quality. Where possible, we pooled data from the individual studies using a random-effects model, otherwise we tabulated data. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen completed trials (1608 participants) and two ongoing trials were identified. All included trials compared multifocal and <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> but there was considerable variety in the make and model of lenses implanted. Overall we considered the trials at risk of performance and detection bias because it was difficult to mask patients and outcome assessors. It was also difficult to assess the role of reporting bias. There was moderate quality evidence that similar distance acuity is achieved with both types of lenses (pooled risk ratio, RR for unaided visual acuity worse than 6 / 6 : 0. 98, 95 % con-fidence interval, CI 0. 91 to 1. 05). There was also evidence that people with multifocal lenses had better near vision but methodological and statistical heterogeneity meant that we did not calculate a pooled estimate for effect on near vision. Total freedom from use of glasses was achieved more frequently with multifocal than monofocal IOLs. Adverse subjective visual phenomena, particularly haloes, or rings around lights, were more prevalent and more troublesome in participants with the multifocal IOL and there was evidence of reduced contrast sensitivity with the multifocal lenses...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{eyes that}} are {{primarily}} used under low-light conditions usually have optical systems of short depth of focus, such that chromatic defocus {{may lead to}} considerable blurring of the images. In some vertebrates, the problem is solved by multifocal lenses having concentric zones of different focal lengths, each of which focuses a different relevant spectral range onto the retina. A partially constricted circular pupil would shade the peripheral zones of the lens, leading {{to the loss of}} well-focused images at relevant wavelengths. The slit pupil, however, allows for use of the full diameter of the lens even in bright light. We studied species of terrestrial vertebrates from a variety of phylogenetic groups to establish how widespread multifocal lenses are and how pupil shapes are adapted to the optical systems. We found that multifocal lenses are common from amphibians to mammals, including primates. Slit pupils were only present in animals having multifocal optical systems.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{postoperative}} vision performance of multifocal intraocular lens implantation combined with corneal incision to correct astigmatism {{and that of}} <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lenses</b> implantation. METHODS: Eighty patients(100 eyes) with age-related cataract and low cornea astigmatism were divided into control group and intervention group. Intervention group received limbal relaxing incisions at the steepest meridian axis during phacoemulsification with temporal corneal incision and implanting multifocal intraocular; the control group only received phacoemulsifieation with temporal corneal incision and implanting <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lenses.</b> Uncorrected distance visual acuity(UCDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity(UCNVA) and cornea astigmatism were observed 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. Best corrected near visual acuity(BCNVA), best corrected distance visual acuity(BCDVA), distant corrected near visual acuity(DCNVA), were observed 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: UCDVA and UCNVA in intervention group were higher than that in control group 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively while the cornea astigmatism in intervention group was lower than that in control group. BCNVA, BCDVA and DCNVA in both groups showed obvious improvement 3 d after the surgery. There {{was no significant difference}} between the two groups in UCDVA and UCNVA 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively and in BCDVA and BCNVA 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION:Multifocal intraocular lens implantation combined with transparency cornea relaxing incisions can effectively rectify preoperative cornea astigmatism in cataract patients, and it can provide good visual acuity of entire range, thus to extend the target users of multifocal intraocular lens...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Objective {{evaluation}} of accommodation with a bilateral accommodating intraocular <b>lens</b> (IOL) versus <b>monofocal</b> IOLs. METHODS: Patients received accommodating IOL (Crystalens HD; Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) bilaterally after cataract surgery. These {{were compared to}} a matched group receiving monofocal IOLs. Preoperative and postoperative distance corrected distance, intermediate, and near vision were evaluated. Objective accommodation was measured with the WAM- 5500 Binocular Autorefractor/Keratometer (Grand Seiko, Pty Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan). RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included. Ten received the Crystalens HD in both eyes and nine received one of three <b>monofocal</b> <b>lenses</b> in each eye. Mean postoperative distance corrected distance visual acuity was not statistically different between the two groups. Mean distance corrected intermediate vision was better in the Crystalens HD group (logMAR 0. 24 ± 0. 11 [control], logMAR 0. 11 ± 0. 10 [Crystalens HD], P =. 033). The {{groups did not differ}} signifi cantly for mean distance corrected near vision (logMAR 0. 54 ± 0. 12 [control], logMAR 0. 42 ± 0. 15 [Crystalens HD], P =. 087). However, a signifi cantly greater proportion of Crystalens HD eyes achieved 0. 4 or 0. 3 logMAR for near wearing their distance correction (P =. 013). With distance correction, the mean spherical equivalent failed to show any myopia with accommodative effort in either group. Low contrast and low luminance contrast acuity were not signifi cantly different. CONCLUSION: The Crystalens HD showed some benefi t for intermediate visual function compared to the monofocal IOLs with both groups wearing full correction for distance. There were no signifi cant signs of accommodation in either group. Katherine V. Zamora-Alejo, Sacha Pierre Moore, Douglas G. A. Parker, Katja Ullrich, Adrian Esterman, Michael Goggi...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the efficacy of two types of contact lenses (spherical disposable and aplanatic) as treatment in a patient with esotropia with a high Accommodative Convergence/Accommodation Ratio (AC/A). Due to the possibility of the appearance of accommodative insufficiency in this kind of patient, (i. e., following many years of bifocal glasses use), the elimination of the plus addition lens is advisable. Nevertheless, in some patients, this change leads to the appearance of a residual angle of esodeviation in near vision. It was expected that <b>monofocal</b> aplanatic contact <b>lenses</b> could achieve, due to their optical characteristics, an accurate and orthotropic binocular alignment, without aggravating an undesirable manifestation of the accommodative insufficiency. METHODS: An experimental design of a single case (N= 1) was used in which the subject acted as his own control. With bifocal glasses the subject displayed stability in his binocular and accommodative system at every distance of vision for the past three years. We compared the efficacy of two different types of hydrophilic contact lenses to control the angle of deviation, both at distance and at near vision. RESULTS: Neither of the two contact lenses produced the results of stability and the correct binocular alignment that had been achieved with bifocal glasses. This subject experienced a worse manifest esodeviation in distance vision with aplanatic lenses than with the disposable ones. CONCLUSIONS: These <b>monofocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> did not create acceptable binocular alignment and stability in a subject with a high AC/A accommodative esotropia...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the most appropriate}} analysis technique for the differentiation of multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) designs using defocus curve assessment of visual capability. Methods:Four groups of fifteen subjects were implanted bilaterally with either <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lenses,</b> refractive MIOLs, diffractive MIOLs, {{or a combination of}} refractive and diffractive MIOLs. Defocus curves between - 5. 0 D and + 1. 5 D were evaluated using an absolute and relative depth-of-focus method, the direct comparison method and a new 'Area-of-focus' metric. The results were correlated with a subjective perception of near and intermediate vision. Results:Neither depth-of-focus method of analysis were sensitive enough to differentiate between MIOL groups (p> 0. 05). The direct comparison method indicated that the refractive MIOL group performed better at + 1. 00, - 1. 00 and - 1. 50 D and worse at - 3. 00, - 3. 50, - 4. 00 and - 5. 00 D compared to the diffractive MIOL group (...|$|R
40|$|Two {{elderly women}} have each {{received}} a <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lens</b> {{in one eye}} and a 3 M diffractive bifocal intraocular lens in the other eye. Both eyes were shown to have equivalent retinal/neural function by measuring contrast sensitivity to laser interference fringes which bypassed refractive and other defects of the ocular media. The eyes with a bifocal intraocular lens displayed a much greater depth of focus, though {{at the expense of}} diminished contrast sensitivity compared with the normal values expected for that age. Simulation experiments suggested that the observed reduction in contrast sensitivity was not adequately explained by a simple reduction in retinal illumination of the in-focus image as might intuitively be expected from the bifocal separation of incident light to two simultaneous focal points. The simultaneous superimposition of the out-of-focus image on the in-focus image must also be considered, since this caused a significant reduction in contrast sensitivity when the retinal illumination was insufficiently above the photopic luminance threshold...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} results (contrast {{sensitivity and}} dynamic visual acuity) of 19 multifocal (3 M design) and 14 all polymethylmethacrylate biconvex <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lenses</b> (IOLs), 6 mm in optical diameter were compared. Best corrected visual acuity was > or = 8 / 10 (Monoyer chart) Parinaud 2 in all cases. Major differences of functional performance {{in favour of}} monofocal IOLs were found outside standard conditions of vision (low contrast and illumination levels). A significant difference in contrast sensitivity was found for each spatial frequency in favour of multifocal IOLs (0. 0016 < p < 0. 05). Mesopic vision was statistically higher in the monofocal IOL group (p = 0. 0015). Moreover, dynamic visual acuity allowed accurate evaluation {{of the difference in}} performance between these two models of implant. In view of these results multifocal IOLs should be reserved for patients with normal psychosensitive adaptation; an ocular pathology that could alter contrast sensitivity or mesopic vision is a contraindication for multifocal IOLs...|$|R
40|$|Robert Edward Ang, Rosalie Mae M Reyes, Maria Luisa P Solis Asian Eye Institute, Rockwell Center, Makati City, Philippines Abstract: We {{report on}} a 72 year-old pseudophakic patient who had been {{implanted}} with a <b>monofocal</b> intraocular <b>lens,</b> and who underwent a unilateral Supracor laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedure to correct presbyopia and hyperopia. Uncorrected near visual acuity was improved, but the patient complained of glare, halo, reduced distance vision, and poor night driving vision due to treatment decentration. One year following the surgery, a reversal procedure was conducted with a wavefront-guided aspheric treatment to reverse the presbyopic correction while still maintaining the hyperopic correction. This resulted in 20 / 25 uncorrected distance visual acuity, and it eliminated the dysphotopsia symptoms. We {{believe that this is}} the first reported case demonstrating the ability to reverse the Supracor LASIK presbyopic procedure using wavefront-guided treatment in a case of an unsatisfactory outcome.

50|$|Artificial {{intraocular lenses}} {{are used to}} replace the eye's natural lens that is removed during {{cataract}} surgery. These lenses have been increasing in popularity since the 1960s, {{but it was not}} until 1981 that the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this type of product was issued. The development of intraocular lenses brought about an innovation as patients previously did not have their natural lens replaced and as a result had to wear very thick eyeglasses or some special type of contact lenses.Presently, IOLs are especially designed for patients with different vision problems.
