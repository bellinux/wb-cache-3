In 1988, President Ronald Reagan extended that week to a month-long observance. The National Hispanic Heritage Month {{is a time for}} Americans to educate themselves about the influences Hispanic culture has had on society. The Marine Corps has realized that the fastest growing group in both the United States and the Marines are Hispanics, and have joined the rest of the United States in the celebration of the contributions which Hispanics in the United States Marines Corps have made to that <b>military</b> <b>institution</b> by celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15 through October 15.|$|E

25|$|Over time, the iqtaʿ {{system was}} expanded, and {{increasingly}} larger areas of kharaj (taxable lands) were appropriated as iqtaʿ lands {{in order to}} meet the fiscal needs of the Mamluk <b>military</b> <b>institution,</b> namely payment of Mamluk officers and their subordinates. The Mamluk state resolved to increase allotments by dispersing an individual emir's iqtaʿat over several provinces and for brief terms. However, this led to a situation where the iqtaʿ holders neglected the administrative oversight, maintenance and infrastructure of their iqtaʿat, while concentrating solely on collecting revenues, thereby resulting in less productivity of the iqtaʿat.|$|E

The country had fully democratic elections in 1930, won by Sténio Vincent. The Garde was a new kind of <b>military</b> <b>institution</b> in Haiti. It was a force manned overwhelmingly by blacks, with a United States-trained black commander, Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte. Most of the Garde's officers, however, were mulattoes. The Garde was a national organization; it departed from the regionalism that had characterized most of Haiti's previous armies. In theory, its charge was apolitical—to maintain internal order, while supporting a popularly elected government. The Garde initially adhered to this role.|$|E

500|$|The {{structural}} {{history of}} the Roman military concerns the major transformations in the organization and constitution of ancient Rome's armed forces, [...] "the most effective and long-lived <b>military</b> <b>institution</b> known to history." [...] From its origins around 800BC to its final dissolution in AD476 with {{the demise of the}} Western Roman Empire, Rome's military organization underwent substantial structural change. At the highest level of structure, the forces were split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces. Within the top levels of both army and navy, structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution. These changes can be divided into four distinct phases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the {{connections}} between engineering and warfare/militarism are closer than is usually recognized. It investigates {{the nature of that}} relationship using theoretical perspectives from critical theory and social constructionism. We draw on historical research into the influence of <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> and interests on the field of engineering, but also look broadly at cultures of warfare that extend beyond formalized <b>military</b> <b>institutions.</b> Focusing on engineering labor and engineering epistemologies, we suggest that engineering today can be understood as a “war-built” discipline—even when practiced apart from <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> and projects. We put forward “social justice” as an idealized alternative foundation for engineering. In addition to serving as a corrective to the inordinate influence of militarism on engineering, a social-justice-based approach could also sensitize engineers and others to the pervasive role of social context in shaping both what engineers do and how that is understood to serve broad public interests. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The {{rebellion}} and its suppression effectively {{marked the end}} of the mamluk household al-Jazzar had raised, {{and the end of the}} mamluks as a <b>military</b> <b>institution</b> during al-Jazzar's rule. According to Philipp, the mamluk rebellion was al-Jazzar's [...] "gravest military and political crisis", with the only exception perhaps being Napoleon's siege of Acre in 1799, although the rebellion [...] "was in many ways more serious since it arose from an internal source." [...] The revolt was perceived by al-Jazzar, himself a virtual product of the mamluk system, as a betrayal of his most senior lieutenants, whose careers and wealth he created through his patronage. The rebellion thus had traumatic effects on al-Jazzar's personality, which according to Philipp, transformed al-Jazzar's [...] "latent fears, suspicions and distrust ... into a sense of paranoia". In the rebellion's aftermath, al-Jazzar launched a massive purge in his realm, executing and exiling people of all societal ranks. The 19th-century chronicler Haydar Ahmad Shihab noted that as a result of the rebellion, al-Jazzar [...] "became like an untamed animal ... he imagined that the whole world was against him." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} factors that can {{increase}} or decrease military-economic involvement in communist regimes. This anomalous form of military behavior, labeled as the Military Business Complex (MBC), emerged in various communist regimes in the 1980 s. However, in the early 2000 s, the communist governments of China and Vietnam began to decrease the number of industries managed by their <b>military</b> <b>institutions,</b> while these industries increased in Cuba. This current study asks why the Cuban MBC regime increased in the early 2000 s, while the Chinese and Vietnamese ceased or reduced their MBC involvement. Through a comparative analysis of all three <b>military</b> <b>institutions,</b> this study argues that certain evolving elements within the communist-party-military spectrum in Cuba caused it to expand its military managed-economy. By highlighting the different patterns of MBC evolution in communist regimes, this study sheds light on the general phenomenon of how <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> exert political and economic influence...|$|R
