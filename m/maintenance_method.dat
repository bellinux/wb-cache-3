A time-sequential simulation technique is {{presented in this paper}} in which the effects of weather conditions and <b>maintenance</b> <b>methods</b> in the assessment of reliable cost of integrated distribution systems are provided. Time-Varying Weight Factors (TVWF) are defined to investigate the effect of weather conditions and present <b>maintenance</b> <b>methods</b> on Failure rates (FR). In fact, the average Failure Rate (FR) is combined with TVWF to provide time-varying repair times (TVRTs) for each component. Similarly, the average Repair Time (RT) is also combined with TVWF to produce Time-Varying-Repair Time (TVRT). An experimental distribution system showed that TVFR has more effects on the interruption costs of the sensitive costumers. It has also significant effects on the indices of all costumers. So, it is necessary to consider TVRT in evaluating the reliability of the network cost. Key-Words:- Distribution systems, network reinforcement, reliability cost/worth...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The effective use of computer based tools to support decision making in manufacturing industry is critical to business success. One {{of the most critical}} areas is during product design and especially in design for manufacture. This research will help in understanding of how manufacturing knowledge can be effectively maintained for an existing knowledge base. The work will use modern product lifecycle management tools in combination with a knowledge based environment in order to explore the effectiveness of the methods produced. This work {{is a part of the}} SAMULET (Strategic Affordable Manufacturing in the UK through Leading Environmental Technologies) research program and was done in association with an aerospace manufacturing company. The main focus of this research is to define a novel method for maintaining the machining knowledge associated with manufacturing of Xtra Wide Body (XWB) High Pressure (HP) turbine blade. The four main elements explained in this thesis are, a) the literature review done on knowledge management and knowledge maintenance, b) industrial investigation done on a manufacturing facility, c) detailed explanation of a novel manufacturing knowledge <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> d) four iterative case studies used for the evaluation and iterative improvement of the method. The research concludes that the aspect of knowledge maintenance is important. It is imperative to set out a formalised and mandated knowledge maintenance process in an organisation to keep the knowledge up-to-date and relevant. It has been shown that a novel task based knowledge <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> comprising a Knowledge Maintenance Process (KMP) and a Knowledge Maintenance Template (KMT) provides an effective route to knowledge maintenance.

40|$|A new {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} laser fusion power plant FALCON-D (Fast ignition Advanced Laser fusion reactor CONcept with a Dry wall chamber) has been proposed. The fast ignition method can achieve the sufficient fusion gain for a commercial operation (~ 100) with about 10 times smaller fusion yield than the conventional central ignition method. FALCON-D makes full use of this property and aims at designing with a compact dry wall chamber (5 ~ 6 m radius). 1 -D/ 2 -D hydrodynamic simulations showed {{the possibility of the}} sufficient gain achievement with a 40 MJ target yield. The design feasibility of the compact dry wall chamber and solid breeder blanket system was shown through the thermomecanical analysis of the dry wall and neutronics analysis of the blanket system. A moderate electric output (~ 400 MWe) can be achieved with a high repetition (30 Hz) laser. This dry wall concept not only reduces some difficulties accompanied with a liquid wall but also enables a simple cask <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> for the replacement of the blanket system, which can shorten the maintenance time. The basic idea of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> for the final optics system has also been proposed. Some critical R&D issues required for this design are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We see a {{temporal}} data warehouse {{as a set}} of temporal views defined in the past fragment of the temporal relational algebra extended with set-valued attributes and aggregation. This paper proposes an incremental <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> for temporal views that allows improvements over the re-computation from scratch. We introduce a formalism for temporal data warehouse specification that summarizes information needed for its incremental maintenance. According to this formalism, {{a temporal}} data warehouse W is a pair of two sets of views: the materialized component and the virtual component. The materialized component of W represents the set of views physically stored in the warehouse. The virtual component of W is a set of non-temporal expressions involving only relations kept in the materialized component. Several features of our approach make it especially attractive as a <b>maintenance</b> <b>method</b> for warehouses: (a) {{there is no need for}} storing the entire history of source databases, (b) maintenance of the temporal data warehouse is reduced to maintaining the (non-temporal) materialized component, and (c) the materialized component is self-maintainable. We build a uniform algorithm by combining two previously unrelated techniques based on auxiliary views. Our method is sufficiently general so that it can be easily adapted to treating databases with complex-valued attributes...|$|E
