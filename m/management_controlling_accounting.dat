40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to outline}} the {{financial}} and human cost of bullying in the workplace. The authors investigate how bullying is perpetrated so that <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> to prevent bullying can be put in place, reducing financial and human costs, and the risks posed to organisations by bullying. Design/methodology/approach – The authors' study uses an exploratory on-line survey, designed from a practice perspective. The instigator is an Australian management consultancy working on managing organisational risk. The study is based on sense-making research using open-ended questions, delving into life experiences to recall potential bullying incidences in their work life. The authors then develop hypotheses from their {{review of the literature}} and compare these to the results of their survey. Findings – Most of the authors' findings contradict both academic and practitioner notions of bullying. They find that bullying happens mostly between peers rather than being perpetrated by people in positions of power over weaker colleagues, extends into all levels of the organisation, is perpetrated as part of the normal day-to-day interactions between people, rather than in special circumstances, and is often perpetrated between peers in the presence of other peers. To explain this behaviour the authors introduce the concept of “tournaments” from agency theory and the personal characteristics of perpetrators and victims. Research limitations/implications – From a <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and <b>accounting</b> perspective, managers <b>controlling</b> and <b>accounting</b> for bullying can also be the perpetrators and their participation in organisational politics and competitive tournaments may well be preventing the recognition and control of bullying, counter to what is good for the organisation. Originality/value – This paper's risk management approach to understanding bullying in the workplace is novel; it outlines implications from a <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and <b>accounting</b> perspective. It also uses the concept of “tournaments” to propose why Australian managers tend to want to “sweep the issue under the carpet” and how the authors' research methodology offers a way forward to raise awareness so bullying can become an important part of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> in organisations. 21 page(s...|$|R

Research on how these affect each other is deficient. Therefore this study examines how gazelle companies want to achieve {{economic growth and}} how <b>management</b> and <b>accounting</b> <b>control</b> systems affect the different growth factors. The study was conducted by a survey of quantitative character in which 150 companies that received the gazelle award between the years of 2010 - 2014 participated. All of the participating companies are based in Sweden and represented in more than 30 industries. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify how gazelles aim to achieve future economic growth. The empirical data were analyzed using several statistical tools. To ensure that the variables are of desirable statistical significance a two-sided T-test was performed. Cronbach’s α and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to ensure the variables reliability and an exploratory factor analysis was used to find multicollinearity. The variables innovation and risk correlated strongly and is merged into the new denomination innovativeness. The empirical results ensure with statistical significance that three different factors affect the gazelle companies’ management to achieve economic growth. The three factors that affect the management to future growth are innovativeness, motivation and munificence. The effects of motivation and innovativeness were with the stepwise regression analysis shown to be enhanced by <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems. This implies that <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems should be used to maximize the utility of motivation and innovation activities. Validerat; 20150605 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

The paper analyses the symbolic forms embedded in the management discourse practice of art in the way that the concept is practiced by Kasper Holten, the highly successful Artistic Director of the Royal Danish Opera. Findings – The analysis shows that conventional <b>management</b> <b>control</b> models are rooted in the symbolic form of science, but are at risk of getting caught in assumptions of the form gliding into the symbolic form of religion and myth, where all the forms tend to oppress essential aspects of individuality.

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} {{of organizational}} leaders regarding suggestions related to various managerial techniques {{has led to}} the coinage of the ‘management fashion’ idiom. It has been convincingly argued that phenomena like <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems are prone to trends, and that such trends permeate into the daily life of managers through the use of persuasive rhetoric. This thesis is a theory-generating study of change in <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems. More precisely, its purpose is to seek an understanding of how fashions within the field of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> emerge through processes of interaction and co-production. By asking the question “how do the forces involved in the shaping of a market for <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems interact and combine in order to create management fashions?” the thesis seeks to generate a comprehensive conjecture on the management fashion setting process. The thesis is based on an empirical case study completed with extensive literature readings. In order to generate theory, a methodology based on abductive reasoning has been produced. Theoretically, the thesis borrows from micro sociological theory on imitation and co-production but extends also into such fields as psychology, aesthetics, rhetoric and economics; aside from the obvious <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and <b>management</b> <b>accounting</b> themes. The thesis concludes by producing a comprehensive model of the management fashion setting process. The contribution of the thesis can be understood as either providing an alternative to or completing the dominant interpretation of the phenomena. The main difference between the arrived at suggestion and the prevailing interpretation {{is the role of the}} actors which is changed from norm following consumers of fashion to creative producers of fashion.

ERP-systems {{have been one of the}} most important IT innovations in the past decade. The potential of a properly implemented ERP-system is great because it has got the ability to link the company’s different areas together. Despite its many advantages, there are several examples of cases where the acquisition and implementation has been a total failure. For this reason, the lack of knowledge and experience regarding ERP-systems and its impact on businesses <b>management</b> <b>control,</b> has been recognized.

40|$|As a {{reaction}} to recent corporate scandals, corporate law and accounting regulations have recently been modified in German-speaking countries. Despite changing corporate contexts and agendas, accounting research in these countries has been comparatively silent on issues of corporate governance. In this paper, we discuss this limited response, focusing particularly {{on the field of}} management accounting. In German-speaking countries, management accounting is conceived of in a specific way (usually referred to as Controlling). The traditions of such a practice and the associated academic school of thought have made it difficult for researchers to consider issues of corporate governance and internal control in more empirical depth. Pointing to the importance of investigating the actual use of accounting systems and, thus, the social and institutional context of accounting, we propose a strategy for research and education that would allow for more comprehensive insights into the role that (management) accounting might play in corporate scandals. <b>Management</b> <b>accounting,</b> <b>controlling,</b> governance, ethics, <b>accounting</b> education,...|$|R

Additional analyses show consistency between manufacturing and industrial firms but not service-oriented firms, suggesting limited unreliability of the model across different economic sectors...|$|R
