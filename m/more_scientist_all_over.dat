50|$|Since its creation, ELGRA has {{continuously}} {{encouraged and}} promoted low gravity research in both life and physical sciences within Europe with the permanent {{support of the}} European Space Agency. For several years ELGRA was a study group of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and contributed to a better visibility of Low Gravity research at the highest European spheres. However, its main action remains {{the improvement of the}} scientific collaboration between <b>scientists</b> from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe in the field of low gravity research. In that effort, ELGRA has organized meetings and symposia resulting in 2011 in the 22nd ELGRA symposium held in Antwerp (Belgium) which gathered <b>more</b> than 150 <b>scientists</b> from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world. ELGRA also supports young researchers and students via grants and educational programs from ESA. In 2012, the ELGRA community counts not less than 200 active members. The success of ELGRA reflects the increasing interest of the European scientific community for low gravity. Since the 80s, ELGRA's scientists have been using new research facilities either on the ground, as the 133m drop tower at ZARM (Bremem, Germany) or centrifuges (ESTEC, DLR, MEDES), but also in space with the European Columbus module aboard the International Space Station dedicated to low gravity research. Nowadays, low gravity space research involves <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>scientists</b> from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe and space experiments require more preparation and especially a strong collaboration between the different partners. A collaboration platform dedicated to low gravity research as ELGRA remains crucial to facilitate this collaboration. Additionally, ELGRA joins both Physical as well as Life Sciences, what enhances translational research.|$|R
