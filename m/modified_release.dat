The <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> capsules have retard characteristics which allow the drug to be given as a once-daily dosage.

40|$|Macrophages produce {{nitric oxide}} (NO) via the {{inducible}} {{nitric oxide synthase}} {{as part of a}} successful response to infection. The gene norB of Neisseria meningitidis encodes a NO reductase which enables utilization and consumption of NO during microaerobic respiration and confers resistance to nitrosative stress-related killing by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). In this study we confirmed that NO regulates cytokine and chemokine release by resting MDM: accumulation of TNF-alpha, IL- 12, IL- 10, CCL 5 (RANTES) and CXCL 8 (IL- 8) in MDM supernatants was significantly modified by the NO-donor S-nitroso-N-penicillamine (SNAP). Using a protein array, infection of MDM with N. meningitidis was shown to be associated with secretion {{of a wide range of}} cytokines and chemokines. To test whether NO metabolism by N. meningitidis <b>modifies</b> <b>release</b> of NO-regulated cytokines, we infected MDM with wild-type organisms and an isogenic norB strain. Resulting expression of the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL- 12, and the chemokine CXCL 8 was increased and production of the cytokine IL- 10 and the chemokine CCL 5 was decreased in norB-infected MDM, in comparison to wild-type. Addition of SNAP to cultures infected with wild-type mimicked the effect observed in cultures infected with the norB mutant. In conclusion, NorB-catalysed removal of NO <b>modifies</b> cellular <b>release</b> of NO-regulated cytokines and chemokines. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) have commonly {{been associated}} with upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract side effects including {{a high incidence of}} gastric and duodenal ulceration. Recent reports implicate NSAID use and mucosal injury in the small and large intestine. A trend in NSAID development has been an attempt to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce the severity of upper GI side effects through <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> dosage forms of NSAIDs such as enteric-coating (EC) or sustained release (SR) formulations. It is possible that <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> formulations may increase the exposure of active drug to the mucosa distally to the duodenal bulb, and thereby increase toxicity to distal GI regions where the effects are difficult to monitor. A systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, and Index Medicus was made to identify toxicological effects induced by <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> formulations of NSAIDs in the small and large intestine. An analysis of the identified toxicological effects of these formulations was made. SR and EC NSAID use has {{been associated with}} both small and large intestinal bleeding, anaemia, strictures, ulcerations, perforations, and death. <b>Modified</b> <b>release</b> NSAIDs may cause significant morbidity in some patients. NSAID <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> delivery systems are not guarantors of GI safety. Since SR and EC NSAIDs are widely prescribed and some EC products are available without a prescription, heightened awareness of these toxicological manifestations in more distal sites of the GI tact may reduce morbidity...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Mitotane induces hepatic CYP 3 A 4 activity, {{resulting}} in accelerated cortisol inactivation, and also increases cortisol binding globulin (CBG). Therefore, higher hydrocortisone doses are required {{in patients with}} adrenocortical cancer (ACC) on mitotane treatment. <b>Modified</b> <b>release</b> hydrocortisone has not been used in mitotane-treated ACC patients yet. Aim: Case series to compare serum cortisol, calculated free serum cortisol and ACTH levels in ACC patients on mitotane treatment with immediate and <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> hydrocortisone. Design: Pharmacokinetics of immediate and <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> hydrocortisone, each administered at a dose of 40 - 20 - 0 mg, in nine patients with ACC and adjuvant mitotane treatment. For comparison, ten patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) on three different hydrocortisone regimens and ten healthy males were included. Methods: Serum cortisol and plasma ACTH were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, and CBG by RIA, followed by calculation of free cortisol. Results: Calculated free serum cortisol levels after 40 mg immediate release hydrocortisone in ACC patients (46 ± 14 nmol/l) {{were similar to those}} after 10 mg immediate release hydrocortisone intake in men with SAI (64 ± 16 nmol/l) or to the physiological morning free cortisol levels in healthy subjects (31 ± 5 nmol/l). Compared to immediate release hydrocortisone, free cortisol levels after 40 mg <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> hydrocortisone in ACC patients were significantly lower (12 ± 3 nmol/l; P = 0 · 03) {{resulting in}} a generally lower AUC (98 ± 21 vs 149 ± 37 nmol h/l; P = 0 · 02). Conclusions: 40 - 20 - 0 mg immediate release, but not <b>modified</b> <b>release</b> hydrocortisone, resulted in sufficient glucocorticoid coverage in patients with ACC receiving mitotane treatment.
