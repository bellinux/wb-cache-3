25|$|As {{the green}} light signalled {{the start of the}} race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was {{slightly}} slower away from the line and was challenged {{on the outside of the}} run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard's car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched up into the air and spun through 180 degrees before crashing down again and coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to come to a halt as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now completely blocked, the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.|$|E

40|$|To {{introduce}} selection into a {{model of}} coalescence, I explore the use of modified integer partitions that allow the identification of a preferred lineage. I show that a partition-partition transition matrix, along with Monte Carlo discrete time kinetics, treats both the neutral case and {{a wide range of}} positive and negative selection pressures for small population sizes. Selection pressure causes <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> per generation, short coalescence times, increased lengths of terminal branches, increased tree asymmetry, and dependence of coalescence times on the logarithm of population size.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the class}} of haploid {{exchangeable}} population models with non-overlapping generations and population size $N$ it is shown that, as $N$ tends to infinity, convergence of the time-scaled ancestral process to Kingman's coalescent and convergence in distribution of the scaled times back {{to the most recent}} common ancestor (MRCA) to the corresponding times back to the MRCA of the Kingman coalescent are equivalent. Extensions of this equivalence are derived for exchangeable population models being in the domain of attraction of a coalescent process with <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions.</b> The proofs are based on the property that the total rates of a coalescent with <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions</b> already determine the distribution of the coalescent.

50|$|Richard Marsh is an {{auto racing}} driver from Derbyshire, England. After {{competing}} in the Ford Fiesta championship and the Porsche Carrera Cup he graduated to the production class of the British Touring Car Championship midway through the 2003 season with John Batchelor's Team Varta squad. He remained with the team for 2004 in the Touring Class, initially driving a Honda Civic Type-R but subsequently a Peugeot 307. For 2006 he rejoined the BTCC at its halfway point again driving a Peugeot 307 entered by Team Griffin Motorsport with sponsorship from Farécla. He did not score any points in his first race back, and the team missed several races due to unreliable machinery. For the final round they converted the car to bio-ethanol, qualifying ahead of 6 other cars. For 2007 he and David Pinkney teamed up to drive Alfa Romeo cars for Gary Ayles in the series.

50|$|The race ran {{entirely in}} {{extremely}} wet weather, {{and on the}} first lap David Coulthard lost control of his McLaren, causing a <b>multiple</b> <b>collision</b> involving thirteen drivers, {{which led to the}} race being stopped. After a delay of more than an hour to clear the track, a second attempt was made to start the race, albeit without four of the drivers involved in the incident. At the restart, championship leader and pole-sitter Mika Häkkinen spun his McLaren at the first corner and was hit by the Sauber of Johnny Herbert, forcing them both to retire from the race. Hill took the lead, but was overtaken on lap eight by Michael Schumacher. Schumacher had built up over 30 seconds of advantage over Hill by lap 24 when he came up to lap Coulthard. After being instructed over the team radio to let him past, Coulthard slowed down but stayed on the main racing line; due to the spray behind Coulthard Schumacher was unsighted, hit the back of the McLaren, and caused terminal damage to his Ferrari. Coulthard initially retired due to damage on his own car, but eventually rejoined the race and finished seventh.|$|E

As a result, when we sample $n$ individuals from a population and trace their ancestral lines backwards in time, many lineages may coalesce almost instantaneously {{at the time of}} a selective sweep. We show that as the population size goes to infinity, this process converges to a coalescent process called a coalescent with <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions.</b> A better approximation for finite populations can be obtained using a coalescent with simultaneous <b>multiple</b> <b>collisions.</b> We also show how these coalescent approximations can be used to get insight into how beneficial mutations affect the behavior of statistics that have been used to detect departures from the usual Kingman's coalescent...|$|R
