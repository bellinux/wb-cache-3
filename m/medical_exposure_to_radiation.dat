40|$|Concerns about <b>medical</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> {{ionizing}} <b>radiation</b> {{have become}} heightened {{in recent years}} as a result of rapid growth in procedure volumes and the high radiation doses incurred from some procedures. This paper summarizes the evidence base undergirding concerns about radiation exposure in cardiac imaging. After classifying radiation effects, explaining terminology used <b>to</b> quantify the <b>radiation</b> received by patients, and describing typical doses from cardiac imaging procedures, this paper will address the major epidemiological studies having bearing on radiation effects at doses comparable to those received by patients undergoing cardiac imaging. These include studies of atomic bomb survivors, nuclear industry workers, and children exposed in utero to x-rays, all of which have evidenced increased cancer risks at low doses. Additional higher-dose epidemiological studies of cohorts exposed <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> in the context of medical treatment are described and found to be generally compatible with these cardiac dose–level studies, albeit with exceptions. Using risk projection models developed by the U. S. National Academies that incorporate these data and reflect several evidence-based assumptions, cancer risk from cardiac imaging can be estimated and compared with the benefits from imaging. Several ongoing epidemiological studies will provide better understanding of radiation-associated cancer risks...|$|R
40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is {{a genetic}} {{syndrome}} {{resulting from the}} inheritance of two defective copies of the ATM gene that includes among its stigmata radiosensitivity and cancer susceptibility. Epidemiological {{studies have demonstrated that}} although women with a single defective copy of ATM (AT heterozygotes) appear clinically normal, they may never the less have an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer. Whether they are at increased risk for radiation-induced breast cancer from <b>medical</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> is unknown. We have used a murine model of AT to investigate the effect of a single defective Atm allele, the murine homologue of ATM, on the susceptibility of mammary epithelial cells to radiation-induced transformation. Here we report that mammary epithelial cells from irradiated mice with one copy of Atm truncated in the PI- 3 kinase domain were susceptible to radiation-induced genomic instability and generated a 10 % incidence of dysplastic mammary ducts when transplanted into syngenic recipients, whereas cells from Atm(+/+) mice were stable and formed only normal ducts. Since radiation-induced ductal dysplasia is a precursor to mammary cancer, the results indicate that AT heterozygosity increases susceptibility to radiogenic breast cancer in this murine model system...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostics imaging is an {{essential}} component of patient selection and treatment planning in oral rehabilitation by means of osseointegrated implants. In 2002, the EAO produced and published guidelines on the use of diagnostic imaging in implant dentistry. Since that time, there have been significant developments in both the application of cone beam computed tomography {{as well as in the}} range of surgical and prosthetic applications that can potentially benefit from its use. However, <b>medical</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> must always be justified and result in a net benefit to the patient. The as low a dose as is reasonably achievable principle must also be applied taking into account any alternative techniques that might achieve the same objectives. This paper reports on current EAO recommendations arising from a consensus meeting held at the Medical University of Warsaw (2011) to update these guidelines. Radiological considerations are detailed, including justification and optimization, with a special emphasis on the obligations that arise for those who prescribe or undertake such investigations.

40|$|The Ionizing Radiation (<b>Medical</b> <b>Exposure)</b> Regulations 2000, IR(ME) R, {{apply to}} the safety of the patient {{referred}} for a <b>medical</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> In Scotland, the Scottish Executive (Department of Health) is responsible for carrying out inspections of compliance with these regulations. IR(ME) R specifically addresses issues concerned with Employer's duties, responsibilities of the Practitioner, Operator and Referrer, justification of individual <b>medical</b> <b>exposures</b> for diagnosis and treatment, optimization of all procedures, clinical audit and adequate training of all duty holders. A proactive IR(ME) R inspection of the Clinical Oncology Department, Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, was carried out in November 2001 by inspectors based at the Department of Health, London, and seconded by the Scottish Executive, Department of Health. The aim of the inspection was to assess the degree of compliance with the regulations. In this case study the experiences of a proactive inspection are described in detail and some of the important elements of implementing IR(ME) R in a department that operates an ISO 9000 - 2000 Quality Management System addressed. The identification of IR(ME) R Duty Holders' responsibilities is one important aspect which may be inadequately described by the existing Quality Management System documentation. Other key elements of the inspection include the methods of authorizing the justification, the importance of the treatment prescription sheets in the demonstration of compliance with IR(ME) R, patient identification and pregnancy questions and dose recording procedures. The integration of the standard operating procedures as described in Schedule 1 of the regulations is also important. Where the existing Quality Management System documentation is written to include the IR(ME) R requirements of duty holder's responsibilities and the allocation of all the important tasks, then {{there is no need to}} re-badge these documents for IR(ME) R purposes. IR(ME) R encourages departments to focus on the safety of the patient and to document good practice. In order to comply, departments will have to show evidence of optimization of their procedures and must address the clinical governance issues associated with delivery of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Computed Tomography (CT) is {{the leading}} {{contributor}} <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Although the use of CT brain scans for patients with head injuries and convulsions has shown a tremendous growth, it has raised substantial concerns in the general public {{because of the risk}} of radiation-induced cataracts: the current available strategies <b>to</b> reduce the <b>radiation</b> dose <b>to</b> the eye lens region are limited. Therefore, the present research project was initiated with the aim of evaluating the potential benefit of the combined use of bolus and a bismuth shield on reducing the <b>radiation</b> dose <b>to</b> the eye lens region during CT brain examination. Materials and methods: We conducted a series of phantom studies to measure the entrance surface dose (ESD) that is delivered to the eye lens region during CT brain examination under the effect of different scanning and shielding setups. Results: Our results indicated, during CT brain examination: (1) a drastic reduction of 92. 5 % in the ESD to the eye lens region was found when the CT gantry was tilted from 0 degrees (overall ESD = 30. 7 mGy) to 30 degrees cranially (overall ESD = 2. 4 mGy), and (2) when the CT gantry was positioned at 0 degrees (the common practice in the clinical setting), the setups with the application of a) a bismuth shield, b) a bismuth shield with a face shield (air gap), c) a bismuth shield with bolus, and d) a bismuth shield with bolus and an air gap can result in an acceptable level of image quality with a smaller overall ESD delivered to the eye lens region (overall ESD = 23. 2 mGy, 24 mGy, 21 mGy and 19. 9 mGy, respectively) than the setup without the bismuth shield applied (overall ESD = 30. 7 mGy). Conclusion: When the primary beam scanning through the eye lens region is unavoidable during CT brain examination, the combined use of a bismuth shield with bolus and a face shield is an easy-to-use and inexpensive shielding setup <b>to</b> reduce the <b>radiation</b> dose delivered <b>to</b> the eye lens region while maintaining the correct CT number and a low degree of image noise in the resultant image.

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Despite {{the patient}} and <b>medical</b> staff <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> in {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair, the benefits of this abdominal aortic aneurysm type of surgical management are justfied by minor recovery time and hospitalization, {{as well as an}} option for patients not elected to conventional open repair. In this minimally invasive surgical aproach, time of procedure and radiation doses can be substantial - and the increasing frequency of these procedures and it's complexity have impelled vascular surgeons to face additional and successive risk <b>to</b> occupational <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure.</b> Meticulous study of the computed tomography angiography during the endovascular aneurysm repair preparation allows reduction of unnecessary radiation exposure, as also reduces consecutive image acquisition and contrast use (that may be related to renal overload in susceptible patients). Some studies have proposed strategies to optimize endovascular intervention to reduce contrast use and X-ray exposure. Although they might prove to be effective, they rely on use of additional specific and advanced equipment, available only in major centers. As an alternative to this expensive and restrict technology, it is presented a simpler technique through image manipulation on software OsiriX, aiming <b>to</b> reduce both <b>exposures.</b> OBJECTIVE: <b>To</b> analyze the efficacy of the adoption of a study protocol and a script-based guide in preparation for endovascular aneurysm repair through verifying it's impact over the surgical procedure - as referred to intravascular contrast infuse, effects over renal function, blood loss and operatory time. METHODS: A longitudinal prospective study from March 2014 through March 2015, where 30 performed endovascular aneurysm repair were compared to a historic control group. The planning for endovascular aneurysm repair through the patient's tomographic image manipulation in the prospective group was performed with OsiriX MD software. A script-based guide upon gathering detailed computed tomography angiography images was elaborated by the author and distributed to the performing surgical team for appreciation, instruction and pre operatory judgment. Based upon the script, the C-arm gantry angle was specifically corrected in each case of endovascular aneurysm repair, for image optimization and aneurysm's neck visualization. Arteriography was performed under digital subtraction angiography after catheters were positioned according to predicted level description in the referred guide. Statistical analysis were performed with a significance level of 5 % (P value< 0. 05). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant relationship between the two studied periods and the variables: contrast volume (284. 5 vs. 31. 8 mL), operative time (207. 5 vs. 140. 4 min.) and blood loss (798. 1 vs. 204. 4 mL), revealing that they are considerably larger in the historical control group than in the script guided current group. There was no difference related to the volume of contrast used in the two groups and the occurrence of renal impairment. CONCLUSION: In the present paper it was possible to demonstrate the impact of the ability to manipulate digital formats of medical images without the need of sophisticated equipment, in adoption of a guide based on the compilation of informations collected with assistance of an accessible software performed on a personal computer. Although we could not prove relation to occurrence of renal impairment, there were direct results on reduction of intravascular contrast use, even as surgical time and blood loss, compared to a previous historical period...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{compare the}} {{duration}} of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> among patients with fractures of the distal third of the tibia treated with an intramedullary nail or with a bridge plate. Methods: Intramedullary nails were used for 33 fractures, and bridge plates were used for 41 fractures. In the nail group, according to the AO classification, 14 patients had type A fractures, 15 had type B and four had type C. Twelve patients had closed fractures and 21 had open fractures. In the plate group, 10 patients had type A fractures, 22 had type B and nine had type C. Twenty-seven patients had closed fractures and 14 had open fractures. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in {{the duration of}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> between the patients treated using a nail and those treated using a plate (p = 0. 0001).
