5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if <b>mediastinitis</b> (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{situations}} in which endoscopic techniques are not indicated, such as for small blunt objects less than 2.5cm which have already passed into the stomach (as these usually do not obstruct anywhere else), when there is perforation of the esophagus or <b>mediastinitis</b> (inflammation of structures around the esophagus), and for narcotic-containing bags or condoms that have been ingested, {{because of the risk}} of overdose if they are ruptured.|$|E
25|$|For example, Bacillus anthracis is {{considered}} an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy spores, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary influenza-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal hemorrhagic <b>mediastinitis</b> within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients. Finally, friendly personnel can be protected with suitable antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|When a thymoma is suspected, a CT/CAT scan is {{generally}} performed {{to estimate the}} size and extent of the tumor, and the lesion is sampled with a CT-guided needle biopsy. Increased vascular enhancement on CT scans can be indicative of malignancy, as can be pleural deposits. [...] Limited biopsies {{are associated with a}} very small risk of pneumomediastinum or <b>mediastinitis</b> and an even-lower risk of damaging the heart or large blood vessels. Sometimes thymoma metastasize for instance to the abdomen.|$|E
2500|$|Disincentives: The Tax Relief & Health Care Act of 2006 {{required}} the HHS Inspector General to study ways that Medicare payments to hospitals could be recouped for [...] "never events", {{as defined by}} the National Quality Forum, including hospital infections. In August 2007, CMS announced that it will stop payments to hospitals for several negative consequences of care that result in injury, illness or death. This rule, effective October 2008, would reduce hospital payments for eight serious types of preventable incidents: objects left in a patient during surgery, blood transfusion reaction, air embolism, falls, <b>mediastinitis,</b> urinary tract infections from catheters, pressure ulcer, and sepsis from catheters. Reporting of [...] "never events" [...] and creation of performance benchmarks for hospitals are also mandated. Other private health payers are considering similar actions; in 2005, HealthPartners, a Minnesota health insurer, chose not to cover 27 types of [...] "never events". [...] The Leapfrog Group has announced that they will work with hospitals, health plans and consumer groups to advocate reducing payment for [...] "never events", and will recognize hospitals that agree to certain steps when a serious avoidable adverse event occurs in the facility, including notifying the patient and patient safety organizations, and waiving costs. Physician groups involved in the management of complications, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have voiced objections to these proposals, observing that [...] "some patients develop infections despite application of all evidence-based practices known to avoid infection", and that a punitive response may discourage further study and slow the dramatic improvements that have already been made.|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>mediastinitis</b> {{is usually}} {{bacterial}} {{and due to}} rupture of organs in the mediastinum. As the infection can progress rapidly, this is considered a serious condition. Chronic sclerosing (or fibrosing) <b>mediastinitis,</b> while potentially serious, {{is caused by a}} long-standing inflammation of the mediastinum, leading to growth of acellular collagen and fibrous tissue within the chest and around the central vessels and airways. It has a different cause, treatment, and prognosis than acute infectious <b>mediastinitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of modern cardiovascular surgery, cases of acute <b>mediastinitis</b> usually arose from either perforation of the esophagus or from contiguous spread of odontogenic or retropharyngeal infections. However, in modern practice, most cases of acute <b>mediastinitis</b> result from complications of cardiovascular or endoscopic surgical procedures.|$|E
50|$|In {{absence of}} proper {{treatment}} {{and especially in}} immunocompromised individuals, complications can arise. These include recurrent pneumonia, respiratory failure, fibrosing <b>mediastinitis,</b> superior vena cava syndrome, pulmonary vessel obstruction, progressive fibrosis of lymph nodes. Fibrosing <b>mediastinitis</b> is a serious complication and can be fatal. Smokers with structural lung disease have higher probability of developing chronic cavitary histoplasmosis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mediastinitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the tissues in the mid-chest, or mediastinum. It can be either acute or chronic.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic <b>mediastinitis</b> {{is usually}} a radiologic {{diagnosis}} manifested by diffuse fibrosis of the soft tissues of the mediastinum. This is sometimes the consequence of prior granulomatous disease, most commonly histoplasmosis. Other identifiable causes include tuberculosis, IgG4-related disease and radiation therapy. Fibrosing <b>mediastinitis</b> most frequently causes problems by constricting blood vessels or airways in the mediastinum. This may result in such complications as superior vena cava syndrome or pulmonary edema from compression of pulmonary veins.|$|E

50|$|While {{histoplasmosis}} is {{the most}} common cause of <b>mediastinitis,</b> this remains a relatively rare disease. Severe infections can cause hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and adrenal enlargement. Lesions have a tendency to calcify as they heal.|$|E
50|$|Deep neck {{infections that}} develop as a {{consequence}} of oral, dental and pharyngeal infections are generally polymicrobial in nature. These include extension of retropharyngeal cellulitis or abscess, <b>mediastinitis</b> following esophagus perforation, and dental or periodontal abscess.|$|E
50|$|Infection {{represents}} the primary non-cardiac complication from cardiothoracic surgery. Infections can include <b>mediastinitis,</b> infectious myo- or pericarditis, endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia, empyema, and bloodstream infections. Clostridum difficile colitis can also develop when prophylactic or post-operative antibiotics are used.|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} by Smith (1953), and elaborated upon by Cameron et al. (1976), internal pancreatic fistulas {{can result in}} pancreatic ascites, mediastinital pseudocysts, enzymatic <b>mediastinitis,</b> or pancreatic pleural effusions, depending on the flow of pancreatic secretions from a disrupted pancreatic duct or leakage from a pseudocyst.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the most}} common cause of esophageal {{perforation}} is iatrogenic. However, iatrogenic perforations, while still constituting a serious medical condition, are easier to treat and less prone to complications, particularly <b>mediastinitis</b> and sepsis. This is because they usually do not involve contamination of the mediastinum with gastric contents.|$|E
50|$|Anaerobic gram-positive cocci and microaerophilic streptococci {{are most}} {{frequently}} found in aspiration pneumonia, empyema, lung abscesses, and <b>mediastinitis.</b> These bacteria account for 10-20% of anaerobic isolated recovered from pulmonary infections.It is difficult to obtain appropriate culture specimens.

5000|$|George Sarton {{wrote in}} the Introduction to the History of Science: [...] "The Qanun is an immense {{encyclopedia}} of medicine.

50|$|With the {{exception}} of a few case reports describing survival without surgery, the mortality of untreated Boerhaave syndrome is nearly 100%. Its treatment includes immediate antibiotic therapy to prevent <b>mediastinitis</b> and sepsis, surgical repair of the perforation, and if there is significant fluid loss it should be replaced with IV fluid therapy since oral rehydration is not possible. Even with early surgical intervention (within 24 hours) the risk of death is 25%.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge of {{head and}} neck anatomy is of {{paramount}} importance for dental surgeons and students. Knowledge of anatomy of nerves and other vital structures in the {{head and neck}} allows the dentist to perform diagnosis and surgery. For example, infected teeth can on rare occasions cause infection to spread leading to cavernous sinus thrombosis, <b>mediastinitis,</b> or Ludwig's angina causing airway blockage. Which of these potentially fatal outcomes may occur depends largely on the anatomy of the head and neck.|$|E

50|$|Anterior {{disruption}} of a pseudocyst or a pancreatic duct leads to leakage of pancreatic secretions into the free peritoneal cavity, leading to pancreatic ascites. If the duct is disrupted posteriorly, the secretions leak through the retroperitoneum into the mediastinum via the aortic or esophageal hiatus. Once in the mediastinum, the secretions {{can either be}} contained in a mediastinal pseudocyst, lead to enzymatic <b>mediastinitis,</b> or, more commonly, leak through the pleura to enter the chest and form a chronic pancreatic pleural effusion.|$|E

50|$|Histoplasmosis {{is usually}} a {{subclinical}} infection that does {{not come to the}} attention of the person involved. The organism tends to remain alive in the scattered pulmonary calcifications; therefore, some cases are detected by emergence of serious infection when a patient becomes immunocompromised, perhaps decades later. Frank cases are most often seen as acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, a disease that resembles acute pneumonia but is usually self-limited. It is most often seen in children newly exposed to H. capsulatum or in heavily exposed individuals. Erythematous skin conditions arising from antigen reactions may complicate the disease, as may myalgias, arthralgias, and rarely, arthritic conditions. Emphysema sufferers may contract chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis as a disease complication; eventually the cavity formed may be occupied by an Aspergillus fungus ball (aspergilloma), potentially leading to massive hemoptysis. Another uncommon form of histoplasmosis is a slowly progressing condition known as granulomatous <b>mediastinitis,</b> in which the lymph nodes in the mediastinal cavity between the lungs become inflamed and ultimately necrotic; the swollen nodes or draining fluid may ultimately affect the bronchi, the superior vena cava, the esophagus or the pericardium. A particularly dangerous condition is mediastinal fibrosis, in which a subset of individuals with granulomatous <b>mediastinitis</b> develop an uncontrolled fibrotic reaction that may press on the lungs or the bronchi, or may cause right heart failure. There are a number of other rare pulmonary manifestations of histoplasmosis.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is not {{standardized}} {{for other}} instances of MRSA infection {{in a wide}} range of tissues. Treatment varies for MRSA infections related to: subperiosteal abscesses, necrotizing pneumonia, cellulitis, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, <b>mediastinitis,</b> myocardial, perinephric, hepatic, and splenic abscesses, septic thrombophlebitis, and severe ocular infections, including endophthalmitis. Pets can be reservoirs and pass on MRSA to people. In some cases, the infection can be symptomatic and the pet can suffer a MRSA infection. Health departments recommend that the pet be taken to the veterinarian if MRSA infections keep occurring in the people who have contact with the pet.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{operations on}} the pericardium (the sac {{that surrounds the}} heart) {{took place in the}} 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero (1801), Dominique Jean Larrey (1810), Henry Dalton (1891), and Daniel Hale Williams (1893). The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. Cappelen ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with a fever and died three days after the surgery from <b>mediastinitis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Radiography and CT (Computed tomography) {{are useful}} {{tools in the}} {{diagnosis}} of spirocercosis.

A pneumooesophagram or positive contrast oesophagram {{can be helpful in}} delineating the mass(es). An important factor is that the vet MUST take at least TWO orthogonal, thoracic views using a high kV (70 + 2 x cm thickness of chest) and low mAs (0.02) technique. Some authors have described the DV/VD evaluation of the aortic silhouette as the MOST accurate way of diagnosing spirocercosis on a radiograph, and spondylitis as an aid which increases sensitivity from 53% to 86%. One third of patients have spondylitis. Do not confuse spondylitis with spondylosis. A right lateral radiograph is the preferred lateral view in South Africa, as the normal oesophagus cannot ordinarily be seen in this view., ...|$|E
