40|$|International audienceThe {{authors of}} the paper are {{interested}} in an environmental incentive payment mode for risk-averse contracting farmers. The incitement joins the environmental output produced by the farmer to his effort through an environmental contract reported to be motivating. However, we suppose an environmental output depending on a weather signal and we consider {{the effect of a}} weather variable on the incentive contract. The first and usual incentive contract studied takes into account the average effect of a weather indicator on the farmer's environmental output. The paper studies a second incentive contract taking into account the instantaneous effect of a weather indicator on the fanner's environmental output. Then in complement of the reservation farmer's utility, authors consider a <b>minimum</b> incentive <b>payment</b> given to the farmer through a constraint of a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> for every point of farmer's output. It is possible to increase this <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> in the second type contract (compared to the first one) without reducing the expected utility of the principal and the expected utility of the fanner, by increasing the level of the farmer's environmental action.

50|$|Many {{forms of}} social {{insurance}} schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs {{in the health care}} delivery system.

Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver universal health care, {{which may or may not}} also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less.

40|$|Repayment decisions—how much of {{the loan}} to repay and when to make the payments—directly {{influence}} consumer debt levels. The authors examine how <b>minimum</b> required <b>payment</b> policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that though presenting <b>minimum</b> required <b>payment</b> information has {{a negative impact on}} repayment decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U. S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U. K. credit card field data indicates that these effects are also moderated by borrowers’ credit limit and balance due. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.

50|$|Table 1 below, {{given by}} Prosper (2005), shows data from Experian, {{one of the}} 3 main U.S. and UK credit bureaus (along with Equifax in the UK and TransUnion in the U.S. and internationally). (The data {{actually}} come from installment loans end loans, but {{can also be used}} as a fair approximation for credit card loans end loans). The table shows the loss rates from borrowers with various credit scores. To get a desired rate of return, a lender would add the desired rate to the loss rate to determine the interest rate. Though individual borrowers differ, lenders predict that, as an aggregate, borrowers will tend to exhibit the same payment behavior that others with similar credit scores have shown in the past. Banks then compete on details by making analyses of how to use data such as these along with any other data they gather from the application and history with the cardholder, to determine an interest rate that will attract borrowers by remaining competitive with other banks and still assure a profit. Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is another important factor for determining interest rates. The bank calculates it by adding up the borrower's obligated <b>minimum</b> <b>payments</b> on loans, and dividing by the cardholder's income. If it is more than a set point (such as 20% in this example) then loans to that applicant are considered a higher risk than given by this table. These loss rates already include incomes the lenders receive from payments in collection, either from debt collection efforts after default or from selling the loans to third parties for further collection attempts, {{at a fraction of the}} amount owed.|$|E
