5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

5|$|Irataba {{assisted}} Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves {{during his}} 1851 {{exploration of the}} Colorado. On March 19, 1851, a family of Mormon settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train {{in what is now}} Arizona, were attacked by a band of Western Yavapai, probably the Tolkepaya. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old Olive Oatman and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned that having a white girl among them <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as an offense by whites, brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell, releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites.|$|E

50|$|Méchain {{discovered}} either 25 or 26 deep-sky objects, {{depending on}} how one counts M102. However, Méchain specifically disavowed the observation from 1783 onwards as a mistaken re-observation of M101. Since that time, others have proposed that he did in fact observe another object, and suggested what they <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>See</b> the discussion The M102 Controversy for more details.|$|R

25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not one accepts those actual details, such a molecule-based system offers (i) {{an obvious}} scope for {{clear-cut}} encoding, (ii) an obvious explanation for any inherited behaviour-traits, (iii) a vastly {{greater number of}} candidate-codes from which to select-or-waste in a Darwinian contest; etc. Hence, this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as overcoming Crick's objections, at least partially.|$|E

25|$|The median is used {{primarily}} for skewed distributions, which it summarizes {{differently from the}} arithmetic mean. Consider the multiset { 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 14 }. The median is 2 in this case, (as is the mode), and it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a better indication of central tendency (less susceptible to the exceptionally large value in data) than the arithmetic mean of 4.|$|E
25|$|Qualified {{majority}} {{voting is}} {{designed by the}} Treaty of Rome to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the European Council of Ministers.

25|$|Brodovitch was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} color was relatively new in magazines, with laborious preparation and high costs. By using process or second color inventively, Brodovitch was able to give the magazine an added sense of currency and luxury. He applied color to his layouts expressively, often choosing to use colors bolder than <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the real world. Even after full-color reproduction became standard practice, he still used broad swaths of single colors for bold emphasis.|$|E

25|$|In a {{statement}} on 13 July 2007, which appeared on the Lubbock Trust website, Bennett said that {{the contents of the}} site had been agreed by all members of The Trust 13 months earlier, and the reason for including the information was that it related directly to the probable cause of Stuart Lubbock's death. He added that, due to concerns expressed by Lubbock Trust chairman Harry Cichy that some of the material <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as 'homophobic', and following a complaint to the website's server, NetPivotal, and a request from them, some of that page had been removed.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated {{to show up for}} an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E

25|$|The Indian National Congress had conditionally {{supported}} the Allied war effort, and the Indian expatriate nationalists were concerned during this early phase that they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as Quislings. This was particularly strong amongst {{members of the}} Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge, which together with the IIL formed {{what was called the}} Indian National Council. Swami Satyananda Puri, a prominent member of the Lodge reportedly mentioned before the Tokyo conference that Nehru had forbidden Indians residing outside India from interfering in her internal politics. It was in this context that in a meeting in Singapore in March 1942, a unanimous decisions were taken to seek approval of the Indian National Congress for taking Japanese assistance, and to press for Subhash Chandra Bose to assume leadership of the movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} {{for the creation of}} the Orton and Spooner Ghost House <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in 18th and 19th-century London and Paris, when literature, performances by magicians, spiritualists and psychics, as well as theatrical shows and attractions introduced the public to gruesome entertainment. In 1802, Marie Tussaud scandalized British audiences with an exhibition of wax sculptures of decapitated victims of the French Revolution, including King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre and Jean-Paul Marat. Her exhibits exist today as the Chamber of Horrors in Madam Tussauds in London. In France, from 1897, the Grand Guignol theatre was scaring audiences with graphically staged horror entertainment. The Phantasmagoria show existed even earlier, but a well-known version in 1797 Paris was the Fantasmagorie, which made use of magic lantern projections and crude special effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} by Harris (2002) tested these {{hypotheses}} among 210 individuals, 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men. Results {{found that more}} heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity, with heterosexual men being the highest, and that when forced to choose, gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be more troubling than sexual infidelity (Harris, 2002). These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion {{that there would be}} no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation; however more research in this area should be conducted. Blow and Bartlett (2005) suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as more acceptable in some relationships, the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy.|$|E
