40|$|The {{origin of}} Nardus stricta {{dominated}} subalpine grassland (Nardo-Caricion rigidae alliance) is a frequently discussed {{topic in the}} Giant Mountains (Karkonosze in the Czech Republic). Many researchers considered them, as secondary stands arisen after Pinus mugo removal and by consequent oligotrophization of original plant communities, caused by long-term rough grazing and hay making activities without manuring. On the contrary, they are recognized as natural due to inability of generative reproduction of N. stricta and the very slow vegetative spread there. The {{aim of this study}} was to find proofs for generative reproduction of <b>mat</b> <b>grass</b> in subalpine conditions of the Giant Mountains. We identified a Pinus mugo nursery with arable land abandoned in 1956 and compared its vegetation with that of the surrounding area. Dense and homogenous sward dominated by N. stricta developed during the succession on the old arable land for 48 years, and it is an indisputable proof of generative reproduction of N. stricta there. Synthesizing historical facts on human activities in the past and the results of our contemporary vegetation analysis, we conclude that the Nardo-Caricion rigidae grassland was capable to spread relatively quickly, when agricultural activities above the upper timber line were introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} to shade in growth and nutritive quality of buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) was {{compared with that}} of two other stoloniferous grasses, <b>mat</b> <b>grass</b> (Axonopus compressus) and kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum). The grasses were grown outdoors in Brisbane, Australia, in soil in pots over two growing seasons in 1985 / 86. Treatments in the first season (Expt 1) were shading at 0 (full sun), 42, 59 and 68 % with moderate N (two spaced applications of 50 kg/ha) and, in the second season (Expt 2), 0 and 59 % shade with high (50 kg/ha every 2 weeks) and low (5 kg/ha every 2 weeks) N. Unusually for tropical grasses, the top yield of all species was higher under shade than in full sun, except for S. secundatum at high N in Expt 2. 5. secundatum and A. compressus showed an increase in top yield up to 68 % shading whereas P. clandestinum reached a maximum at 42 % shading. Shade increased shoot: root ratio and specific leaf area in all species but had little effect on leaf: stem ratio and the proportion of dead material in the tops. Stubble yield (stem bases and stolons) was reduced under shade but to a much smaller extent than root yield. S. secundatum and A. compressus had similar morphological characteristics. Their yield was lower than that of P. clandestinum in Expt 1 (autumn growth) but was similar to that of P. clandestinum in Expt 2 (summer growth). These grasses had a higher leaf: stem ratio and lower proportion of dead material in tops than P. clandestinum. Shade generally increased herbage nutritive value through an increase in N cncentration and dry-matter digestibility. The latter response was somewhat variable and mostly small (1 - 3 % units). Under shade, the general trend was towards a decrease in total nonstructural carbohydrates, cell-wall content and insoluble ash, and an increase in lignin content. A. compressus was higher in digestibility and soluble carbohydrates than the other grasses. S. secundatum was not clearly superior in {{response to}} shade and its nutritive quality was lower than that of A. compressus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Sea {{grass on}} the beaches {{is a problem for}} {{tourists}} who demand nice, clean beaches. Hence, in many tourist areas beaches are cleansed of sea grass; the resulting removal of the collected sea grass causes financial and environmental problems. This has initiated research into an alternative use of the sea grass collected. In this paper, a continuous process and equipment for production of mats for insulation in buildings based on sea grass fibres are presented. The material properties obtained is presented. The sea <b>grass</b> <b>mats</b> possess essential material properties that are comparable to those of other organic insulation materials, e. g. the thermal conductivity which is determined to be 0. 0376 W/mK. Based on the test programme the viability of future CE marking of sea <b>grass</b> <b>mats</b> is evaluated in this paper. As a general rule all construction products to be sold on the market in the European Union have to be CE marked. The properties obtained indicate that sea <b>grass</b> <b>mats</b> can be CE marked when a stable production is obtained...|$|R
