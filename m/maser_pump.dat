40|$|In {{this thesis}} the first {{experimental}} {{production and the}} unambiguous measurement of photon number states of an extremely long lived resonator field are described. Three different methods are discussed, all of them using the one-atom-maser apparatus, which examines the interaction of single atoms of a weak thermal atomic beam with a single mode of a microwave resonator with a quality factor of 4. 10 " 1 " 0, corresponding to a photon lifetime of 0. 3 sec. This system is an ideal basis for the build-up of fields containing small photon numbers and detection of these fields using single atoms as detectors. The first method shows how photon number states can be produced using micromaser trapping states. The existence of trapping states can only be explained quantum mechanically and occur under certain special experimental conditions in a continuously pumped one-atom-maser. Trapping states directly reveal the quantization of the cavity field, approaching steady state Fock states under certain conditions. Experiments showing the production of trapping states both in maser lines and <b>maser</b> <b>pump</b> curves are discussed. It is also shown that {{in the limit of}} small pump rates, <b>maser</b> <b>pump</b> curves approach Rabi vacuum oscillations. The main part of this thesis discusses the generation of photon number states in a pulsed one-atom-maser experiment. In this method state reduction following the detection of one or two pump atoms in the maser ground state is used to generate the Fock states with n = 1 and n = 2. The purity of the created states of 99 % for n = 1 and 95 % for n = 2 was measured using the Rabi dynamics of a probe atom interacting with the cavity state. This experiment is the first ever unambiguous measurement of Fock states in a cavity. The comparison of the results to a theoretical model shows very good agreement. (orig.)

The radiative precursor {{from the surface of}} the collisional shock front rapidly diffuses through the cloud, heating the dust grains but leaving the H 2 molecules cool. Transient maser emission occurs as the conditions for the Goldreich and Kwan (1974) 'hot-dust cold-gas' <b>maser</b> <b>pump</b> scheme are realized locally within the cloud. In time, the local maser action quenches due to the heating of the H 2 molecules by collisions against the grains. Although this model cannot explain the very long-lived steady maser features, it is quite successful in explaining a number of the observed properties of the high-velocity features in such sources as Orion, W 51, and W 49.

40|$|Abstract. We {{performed}} NLTE-radiative transfer calculations for interstellar A-type methanol maser {{lines in}} order to find out under which physical conditions the level populations show strong inversion. In our model we considered collisional as well as radiative pumping and accounted for line overlap as well as for torsional excitation of the methanol molecules. The radiation field was calculated using a simple on-the-spot approximation. Our results show that torsional excitation can be essential for the <b>maser</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism while line overlap appears to be of minor importance. In addition to the well known Class I and Class II maser lines, we found two new transitions which possibly may show up as strong masers.

Water masers are found in both high- and low-mass star-forming regions, acting as a powerful tool to compare magnetic field morphologies in both mass regimes. In this paper, we show {{one of the first}} magnetic field determinations in the low-mass protostellar core IRAS 16293 - 2422 at volume densities as high as 10 ^(8 - 10) cm^- 3. Our goal is to discern if the collapsing regime of this source is controlled by magnetic fields or other factors like turbulence. We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to carry out spectro-polarimetric observations in the 22 GHz Zeeman emission of H 2 O masers. From the Stokes V line profile, we can estimate the magnetic field strength in the dense regions around the protostar. A blend of at least three maser features can be inferred from our relatively high spatial resolution data set (~ 0. 1 "), which is reproduced in a clear non-Gaussian line profile. The emission is very stable in polarization fraction and position angle across the channels. The maser spots are aligned with some components of the complex outflow configuration of IRAS 16293 - 2422, and they are excited in zones of compressed gas produced by shocks. The post-shock particle density is in the range of 1 - 3 x 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3, consistent with typical water <b>masers</b> <b>pumping</b> densities. Zeeman emission is produced by a very strong line-of-sight magnetic field (B ~ 113 mG). The magnetic field pressure derived from our data is comparable to the ram pressure of the outflow dynamics.

Comparisons with previous images of the 28 SiO v= 1, 2, J= 1 - 0 transitions at 7 mm (observed in 2001 - 2002) show that the bulk of the J= 2 - 1 transition emission follows the streamlines of the J= 1 - 0 emission and exhibits an overall velocity gradient consistent with the gradient at 7 mm. While there is spatial overlap between the 3 mm and 7 mm transitions, the 3 mm emission, on average, lies at larger projected distances from Source I (~ 44 AU compared with ~ 35 AU for 7 mm). The spatial overlap between the v= 1, J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 transitions is suggestive of a range of temperatures and densities where physical conditions are favorable for both transitions of a same vibrational state. However, the observed spatial offset between the bulk of emission at 3 mm and 7 mm possibly indicates different ranges of temperatures and densities for optimal excitation of the masers.

We searched for the 6. 7 GHz methanol line towards five hot corino sources in the Perseus region using the Arecibo radio telescope. To constrain the excitation conditions of methanol, we observed thermal submillimeter lines of methanol in the NGC 1333 -IRAS 4 region with the APEX telescope. We did not detect 6. 7 GHz emission in any of the sources, but found absorption against the cosmic microwave background in NGC 1333 -IRAS 4 A and NGC 1333 -IRAS 4 B. Using a large velocity gradient analysis, we modeled the excitation of methanol over a wide range of physical parameters, and verify that the 6. 7 GHz line is indeed strongly anti-inverted for densities lower than 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3. We used the submillimeter observations of methanol to verify the predictions of our model for IRAS 4 A by comparison with other CH 3 OH transitions. Our results indicate that the methanol observations from the APEX and Arecibo telescopes are consistent with dense (n ~ 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3), cold (T ~ 15 - 30 K) gas. The lack of maser emission in hot corinos and low-mass protostellar objects in general may be due to densities that are much higher than the quenching density in the region where the radiation field is conducive to <b>maser</b> <b>pumping.</b> Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of planetary nebulae (PNe) that show both OH maser and radio continuum emission (hereafter OHPNe). These have been proposed to be very young PNe, and therefore, they could be key objects for understanding the formation and evolution of PNe. Methods. We consulted the literature searching for interferometric observations of radio continuum and OH masers toward evolved stars, including the information from several surveys. We also processed radio continuum and OH maser observations toward PNe in the Very Large Array data archive. The high positional accuracy provided by interferometric observations allow us to confirm or reject the association between OH maser and radio continuum emission. Results. We found {{a total of six}} PNe that present both OH maser and radio continuum emissions, as confirmed with radio interferometric observations. These are bona fide OHPNe. The confirmed OHPNe present a bipolar morphology in resolved images of their ionized emission at different wavelengths, suggesting that the OH maser emission in PNe is related to nonspherical mass-loss phenomena. The OH maser spectra in PNe present a clear asymmetry, tending to show blueshifted emission with respect to the systemic velocity. Their infrared colors suggest that most of these objects are very young PNe. OHPNe do not form a homogeneous group, and seem to represent a variety of different evolutionary stages. We suggest that OH <b>masers</b> <b>pumped</b> in the AGB phase may disappear during the post-AGB phase, but reappear once the source becomes a PN and its radio continuum emission is amplified by the OH molecules. Therefore, OH maser emission could last significantly longer than the previously assumed 1000 yr {{after the end of the}} AGB phase. This maser lifetime may be longer in PNe with more massive central stars, which ionize a larger amount of gas in the envelope. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

40|$|In {{previous}} calculations for the luminosities of 22 GHz water <b>masers,</b> the <b>pumping</b> {{is reduced}} and ultimately quenched with increasing depth into the gas because of trapping of the infrared (approximately equals 30 - 150 micrometers), spectral line radiation {{of the water}} molecule. When the absorption (and reemission) of infrared radiation by dust grains is included, we demonstrate that the pumping is no longer quenched but remains constant with increasing optical depth. A temperature difference between the grains and the gas is required. Such conditions are expected to occur, for example, in the circumnuclear masing environments created by X-rays in active galaxies. Here, the calculated 22 GHz maser luminosities are {{increased by more than}} an order of magnitude. Application to the well-studied, circumnuclear masing disk in the galaxy NGC 4258 yields a maser luminosity near that inferred from observations if the observed X-ray flux is assumed to be incident onto only the inner surface of the disk...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the production of}} electron cyclotron maser emission by lowdensity, highly magnetized plasmas in relativistic jets. The population inversion required to drive cyclotron maser instability could occur in localized, transient sites where hydromagnetic instabilities, shocks, and/or turbulence lead to magnetic mirroring along current-carrying flux tubes. The <b>maser</b> is <b>pumped</b> by the conversion of kinetic and magnetic energy into j · E work as electrons are accelerated into the maser by the parallel electric field that develops {{as a result of}} the mirror. We estimate the maximum brightness temperatures TB that can be obtained in a single maser site and in an array of many masers operating simultaneously, under conditions likely to apply in blazar jets. Synchrotron absorption, by relativistic electrons within the jet, presents the largest obstacle to the escape of the maser radiation, and may render most of it invisible. However, we argue that a high brightness temperature could be produced in a thin boundary layer outside the synchrotron photosphere, perhaps in the shear layer along th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Atomic and {{molecular}} line emission from protoplanetary disks contains key in-formation of their detailed {{physical and chemical}} structures. To unravel those structures, {{we need to understand}} line radiative transfer in dusty media and the statistical equilib-rium, especially of molecules.

In a second part, the fundamentals of line radiative transfer are introduced along with the various broadening mechanisms. I explain general solution methods with their drawbacks and also specific difficulties en-countered in solving the line radiative transfer equation in disks (e. g. velocity gradients).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mid-infrared}} imaging survey of 21 sites of massive star formation associated with meth-anol masers. Images {{were obtained from}} the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m Blanco tele-scope using the University of Florida imager/spectrometer OSCIR. Of the 10 sites where the methanol masers are distributed in a linear fashion, we Ðnd three sources that are elongated at the same position angle as their linear methanol maser distributions. It is believed that these elongated mid-infrared objects are indeed circumstellar disks. It was found that the masers may arise inside the mid-infrared emitting regions of these young stellar objects, indicating that the methanol <b>masers</b> may be <b>pumped</b> by mid-infrared photons. Many mid-infrared sources in our survey have no detectable radio continuum emis-sion, and we advance the hypothesis that these sources are lower mass, nonionizing stars...|$|R
