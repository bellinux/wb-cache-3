40|$|The {{potential}} of an advanced analytical strategy {{based on the}} use of gas chromatography (GC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with two different analyzers and ionization sources has been investigated and applied to the non-target analysis of food packaging contaminants. Initially, the approach based on GC–time-of-flight (TOF) MS with electron ionization (EI) source allowed performing a library search and mass accurate measurements of selected ions. Then, a second analysis was performed using hybrid quadrupole (Q) TOF MS with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source in order to search for the molecular ion or the protonated molecule and study the fragmentation behavior. This analytical strategy was applied to the analysis of four polypropylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol/polypropylene (PP/EVOH/PP) multilayer trays and one PP/Al foil/PP film, each one subjected to migration assays with the food simulants isooctane and Tenax®, in order to investigate its potential on the determination of <b>migrant</b> <b>substances.</b> Generalitat Valenciana (research group of excellence) : PROMETEO/ 2009 / 054; ISIC 2012 / 01...|$|E
40|$|Food {{simulant}} E, also commercially named Tenax®, {{was established}} in Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 for testing specific migration into dry foodstuffs. This {{presents the results of}} an an Interlaboratory Comparison organised as Proficiency Testing on Food Simulant E containing a cocktail of potential <b>migrant</b> <b>substances.</b> The object of the ILC was to 1) expand the range of polarity and volatility of substance under the scope of the exercise; 2) test the ability of laboratories in the identification and quantification of substances with a free choice of any analytical method and 3) include the screening of unknown substances. The test material used in this exercise was a spiked food simulant E prepared by the EURL-FCM. The choice of the substances was based on the relevant scientific literature related to migration from food contact materials (plastic and paperboard) into simulant E. The participation of the laboratories on this PT on the identification and quantification of ACPH, BP, CAP, DEHA, DTBP, ETHX and OCT in the simulant E was satisfactory regarding the number of received results and thanks to the proactive involvement of the NRLs.

40|$|This {{report shows}} {{the results of}} the Interlaboratory Comparison ILC 01 - 2014, a {{follow-up}} of the previous ILC 01 - 2013. It is a Proficiency Testing (PT) on food simulant E spiked with potential <b>migrant</b> <b>substances</b> carried out by the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Food Contact Materials (FCM). Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 establishes food simulant E for testing migration compliance of plastics in contact with dry foodstuffs. The simulant E (Tenax®) was spiked with 7 substances at given concentrations tailored for this exercise, of which 3 were replaced from the previous year. A list containing 10 substances in which 7 were effectively present in the simulant was distributed to the participants. Homogeneity and stability studies were conducted. The main scope of this ILC 01 - 2014 was to evaluate the improvement on the performance of the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for specific analysis of potential migrants in Tenax®. The participants should identify and quantify the substances spiked in the food simulant by using the analytical method of their choice. The z-score values, for each substance/laboratory, were obtained by the assigned value calculated with the results reported by the participants (robust mean). The participation of the laboratories in this follow-up on identification and quantification of the substances in food simulant E was very satisfactory regarding the number of received results as well as the significant improvement in the performance of the NRLs.

40|$|Research on {{substance}} use among newcomers in Western countries {{has long been}} dominated by the medical paradigm. Their drug consumption has been generally conceptualised {{as a means of}} self-medicating migration-related problems. However, this qualitative study among the Iranian community in Belgium shows that <b>migrant</b> <b>substance</b> use is more complex. Changing (social) circumstances after migration create new contexts of use. Through mechanisms of social exchange, people may get acquainted with new substances, new routes of ingestion or new motives for substance use. This research is based on participant observations and open interviews with 129 Iranian migrants in Belgium. It provides information on both pre- and postmigration patterns of use among this population, emphasising the importance of their own perspective (the insider’s view). Covering a wide range of substances, focusing on opium, tobacco and alcohol, as consumed by Iranians from pre-Islamic times to present day, this book illustrates how different cultures have deﬁned drugs across the ages...|$|R
40|$|Professionals {{working in}} {{addiction}} care in both Belgium and other European countries {{have identified a}} discrepancy between the prevalence of problem substance use among people with a migration background, {{and the presence of}} people with a migration background in treatment facilities. However, little research is currently available on this topic. This study attempts to fill the knowledge gap in existing research by exploring the patterns of substance use, expectations and treatment needs of people with a migration background in four Belgian target groups (the Turkish community in Ghent; the Eastern European communities in Ghent; the Congolese community in Brussels; and asylum applicants, refugees and undocumented <b>migrants).</b> <b>Substance</b> users with a migration background can be particularly difficult for researchers to reach, so community researchers were recruited to interview substance users from within their own network. Over 200 people were interviewed. The project was carried out in close collaboration with the respective communities and with stakeholders in addiction care. This book presents the findings of the study, together with recommendations for health care policy and the practice of addiction care. It also details the explorative and qualitative community-based participatory research design (CBPR) that was used to facilitate the study...|$|R

40|$|Background: Structural {{determinants}} of health are gaining recognition {{as being a}} prominent force in influencing risk of infectious diseases. Both HIV and Chagas disease are strongly influenced by structural inequities and represent significant burdens of communicable disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years in Latin America. Objective: Using the risk environment framework as a guide, the primary objective of this dissertation is to explore physical, social, and individual factors associated with increased risk for two diseases of interest: HIV and Chagas disease. Specific aims of each manuscript chapter are: To test structural factors associated with smoking methamphetamine among a cohort of female sex workers (FSWs) in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico (Chapter 2); To determine the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors, HIV, and syphilis and to analyze variables associated with inconsistent condom use among casual partners among a sample of <b>substance</b> using <b>migrants</b> residing at the Mexico/Guatemala border (Chapter 3); To determine the seroprevalence of Chagas disease in regional and international migrant populations at the Mexico/Guatemala border and assess correlates of infection including migration path, sociodemographic, and socioeconomic variables (Chapter 4). Methods: Chapter 2 uses data from a longitudinal cohort study of FSWs in Tijuana (Mapa de Salud). Chapters 3 and 4 use data from a cross-sectional study among international and regional migrants at the Mexico/Guatemala border (Cruzando Fronteras). Chapter 4 also uses data from a UC MEXUS dissertation grant on Chagas disease. Results: We found that FSWs and <b>migrants</b> who used <b>substances</b> were at heightened risk for HIV via their substance use and sexual risk behaviors. The key social and physical structural factors associated with those risk behaviors were neighborhood, housing, and access to condoms. For Chagas disease, key physical structural factors were impoverished housing and being born in a rural area. Conclusions: The risk environment framework was a useful way to conceptualize the hypothesized relationships between structural factors and individual risk behaviors. This dissertation highlights multiple areas of structural vulnerability in order to suggest potential intervention points and shed greater light on the spaces in which our participants live...|$|R
