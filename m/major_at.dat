5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a <b>major</b> <b>at</b> the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E

5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840.

He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin.

He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E <b>major</b> <b>at</b> the age of seven.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lottah, Tasmania, on 17September 1903, Alan Charlesworth {{was the son}} of a storeman, Edwin Charlesworth, and {{his wife}} Louisa. The youth {{attended}} Lottah Public School and St Virgil's College, Hobart, before entering the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1920.
