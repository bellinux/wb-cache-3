5|$|This article lists {{aircraft}} {{accidents and}} incidents which resulted in at least 50 fatalities in a single occurrence involving commercial passenger and cargo flights, military passenger and cargo flights, or general aviation flights that {{have been involved in}} a ground or <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> with either a commercial or military passenger or cargo flight.|$|E
5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision.</b> A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision,</b> losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy. He ejected through the canopy, parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he could. He would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) {{as the future}} source of aircraft surveillance worldwide provides an opportunity to introduce high-precision airborne conflict alerting systems for operations in high-density traffic environments. Current alerting systems have been very successful at preventing <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> in the en-route environment but have limited benefit in high-density environments such as near airports where most <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> occur (59 %). Furthermore, introducing an ADS-B-enabled conflict alerting system generates an incentive for General Aviation users to voluntarily equip with ADS-B avionics.

5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions.</b> Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|R
50|$|Machol had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in aviation, starting with {{his days in}} the Navy. He continued to pursue his interest in aviation {{as a consultant to}} the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). The pilot’s union was concerned with safety issues — in particular, potential <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> of bunched planes — over portions of the North Atlantic that were not covered by radar. This work resulted in publications on the allowable separation distance between jet aircraft over the Atlantic and led to a protocol that exists to this day - and which has resulted in no <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> in this space.|$|R
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> {{occurred}} over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E
5|$|Born in Braunschweig, Waldmann {{volunteered for}} {{service in the}} Luftwaffe in 1940. After {{training}} at various pilot and fighter-pilot schools, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), operating on the Eastern Front, in August 1942. Here Waldmann fought in the aerial battles over Stalingrad, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the Crimea. He was credited with 84 aerial victories before briefly being transferred to the Western Front, where he was credited with one aerial victory. Back on the Eastern Front, Waldmann accumulated further victories, bringing his score to 125 victories by end of May 1944. He then fought in the skies over France after the Western Allied Invasion of Normandy, claiming seven aerial victories, before converting to the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in late 1944. Flying the Me 262, Waldmann shot down two North American P-51 Mustangs on 22 February 1945 before being killed in a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> {{with one of his}} squadron members on 18 March 1945 near Schwarzenbek, Holstein.|$|E
500|$|Wade is {{best known}} for his ability to convert {{difficult}} lay-ups, even after hard <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> with larger defenders. As crowd pleasing as his high-flying style of basketball may be, some have expressed concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner, as Wade has already hurt his knees and wrists after <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> with larger players. Wade has also established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals. He became the NBA's all-time leader in blocks for players listed 6'4" [...] (193cm) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games, over 400 games less than the previous record holder: Dennis Johnson (1100).|$|R
25|$|As {{near-misses}} and <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> continued, {{the public}} demanded action. Often-contentious congressional hearings followed, and in 1957 increased funding was allocated to modernize ATC, hire and train more air traffic controllers, and procure much-needed radar—initially military surplus equipment.|$|R
50|$|Versions {{are sold}} {{for use in}} light aircraft, helicopters, and gliders. Newer PowerFLARM models extend the FLARM range to over 10 km. They also have an {{integrated}} ADS-B and transponder Mode-C/S receiver, {{making it possible to}} also avoid <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> with large aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a rigid airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition to the pilot of the airplane. One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in {{what could have been}} a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E
5|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{human error}} include American Airlines Flight 965, which {{crashed into a}} mountain in Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, killing 151 passengers and eight crew members with four survivors, and the <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> of DHL Flight 611 near Überlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on July 1, 2002, {{with the loss of}} two on board plus 69 on a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154. The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the collision of DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors. Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its pitot tube sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{implementation}} of TCAS added a safety barrier {{to help prevent}} <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions.</b> However, further study, refinements, training and regulatory measures were still required, because the limitations and misuse of the system still resulted in other incidents and fatal accidents, which include: ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types and causes of <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions.</b> On some occasions, {{military}} aircraft conducting training flights inadvertently collide with civilian aircraft. Before 1958, civilian {{air traffic controllers}} guiding civilian flights and military controllers guiding military aircraft were both unaware of the other's aircraft.|$|R
500|$|... {{but there}} are some hazards. Although {{training}} and safe procedures are central to the ethos of the sport, a few fatal accidents occur every year, almost all caused by pilot error. In particular there is a risk of <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> between gliders, because two pilots might choose to fly to the same area of lift and so might collide. Because of this risk, pilots usually wear parachutes. To avoid other gliders and general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. In several European countries and Australia, the FLARM warning system is used to help avoid <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> between gliders. A few modern gliders have a ballistic emergency parachute to stabilize the aircraft after a collision.|$|R
5|$|The {{greatest}} number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 {{people died in the}} crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision,</b> to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths. The Boeing analysis suggests a decrease of commercial aviation accident fatality rates {{toward the end of the}} study period.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1955, 1955 Cincinnati <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision,</b> a Martin 2-0-2 was in {{the take}} off phase of {{departure}} from the airport when it collided with a privately owned Castleton Farm's DC-3. The <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> killed 13 people on the commercial airliner and 2 on the privately owned planes.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> in German {{airspace}} in ten years.|$|E
40|$|Aerial fire {{fighting}} is a high-risk, high-cost aviation environment. Normal aviation risks are magnified, sometimes significantly, {{by a number}} of factors. Over the years a number of accidents (<b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> and controlled flight into terrain), near <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions,</b> and other serious incidents involving {{fire fighting}} aircraft have occurred. The causes of these accidents or incidents have been primarily attributed to loss of situational awareness in the relatively unstructured aerial environment surrounding wildland fires. In an effort to improve safety and efficiency researchers at NASA Ames Research Center are working with aerial fire fighters to develop a standard phraseology, air space structure, and a navigatiodsituation display. This paper will focus on the results of an initial communication analysis, and will present a prototype airspace structure, and the preliminary design and evaluation of the navigatiodsituation display...|$|R
25|$|A {{collision}} with another canopy is a statistical hazard, {{and may be}} avoided by observing simple principles, including knowing upper wind speeds, the number of party members and exit groups, and having sufficient exit separation between jumpers. In 2013, 17% of all skydiving fatalities in the United States resulted from <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions.</b>|$|R
50|$|As bumps {{can cause}} serious injury, {{there are rules}} to protect players, {{particularly}} to protect {{the head of a}} player being bumped. <b>Mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> can happen in a marking contest when players are committed to the ball, however these collisions are considered accidental or incidental when players make the ball their sole objective.|$|R
