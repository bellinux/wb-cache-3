40|$|The major (gene VIII) {{coat protein}} of {{bacteriophage}} fd was radiolabelled by treating the virus with methyl[3 H]acetimidate without causing any loss of infectivity. Complete amidination of lysine- 8 in the {{amino acid sequence}} of the protein was achieved but little or no modification of the lysine residues near the C terminus was observed. This supports {{the assumption that the}} coat protein is oriented in the viral filament with its N terminus on the outside and its C-terminal region abutting the DNA. Escherichia coli was co-infected with radiolabelled bacteriophage and with unlabelled <b>miniphage,</b> a shorter defective form of phage fd. Radiolabel was detected in the progeny <b>miniphage,</b> proving that individual coat protein subunits can be recycled and assembled onto progeny <b>miniphage</b> DNA. About 35 % of the coat protein subunits of phage particles infecting E. coli were recycled in 1 h. These facts support a model of the assembly and disassembly of the virion at the bacterial membrane in which the end of the particle containing the minor adsorption (gene III) protein, which is presumably the first to disassemble during infection, is the last to assemble during morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Satellite or {{defective}} bacteriophage particles {{can appear}} in extensively recycled stocks of coliphage Mi 3. These particles, herein known as <b>miniphage,</b> replicate using the wild type bacteriophage asa helper. Their physical properties (u. v. spec-tra, sedimentation f DNA and bacteriophage, electrophoretic mobility) are de-scribed and {{a method for}} the isolation of specific satellite bacteriophageis presented...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that M 13 single-strand {{synthesis}} is inhibited at nonpermissive temperature in Escherichia coli polAexl, a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in the 5 ' leads to 3 ' exonuclease activity of polymerase I (T. -C. Chen and D. S. Ray, J. Mol. Biol. 106 : 589 - 604, 1976). Under these conditions the formation of covalently closed replicative form (RF) molecules is greatly reduced, and miniature forms of RF accumulate. We show here that the accumulation of mini-RFs is the consequence of a differential inhibition of the replication of unit-length phage and preexisting <b>miniphage</b> rather than a de novo production of <b>miniphage.</b> Mini-RFs do not accumulate even after as many as nine cycles of growth in the mutant host infected only with unit-length phage. Mixed infections of the mutant host with plaque-purified unit-length phage and a single cloned <b>miniphage</b> show that discontinuities in the mini-RFs are joined with higher efficiency than are those contained in unit-length RFs. After a shift to nonpermissive temperature during single-strand synthesis in cells infected with plaque-purified phage alone, M 13 RFs are found largely as RFII molecules (RF form having one or more single-strand discontinuities) containing only a single discontinuity in the viral strand. The inability of the accumulated unit-length RFII molecules to actively replicate may reflect the presence of either a bound protein or RNA primer on the 5 ' terminus of the viral strand and provides further support for the existence of distinct initiation and termination events in the synthesis of the viral strand...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} plasmid pfdC 1 {{with the}} replication origin of phage fd and fd gene 2 grows autonomously in E. coli cells. DNA sequencing revealed several mutations {{compared to the}} fd genome causing reduced expression of viral gene 2 protein, which can be toxic for the host cell. Another adaptation was noticed for E. coli strains {{with a copy of}} fd gene 2 on the F-episome and a pfdA-plasmid with a minimal fd replication origin, when maintained at 42 degrees C. The carrier cells adjusted their cellular metabolism to these stress conditions, whereas replication functions of the plasmid or expression of fd gene 2 on the F-episome were not changed. The filamentous bacteriophages tend to reduce their genome size into <b>miniphages,</b> which was also observed for phages with an antibiotic resistance gene. Bacteriophages with a transposon insertion in the viral gene 2 had a tendency to restore the mutated gene by exchange with the functional gene 2 carried in recA-host cells. Mobilization of pfd-plasmids with RP 4 transfer functions was reduced due to interference of replication and transfer in the rolling circle mode. The vectors used in these studies can also be applied as cloning vectors, which are compatible with many other plasmid vectors...|$|R
