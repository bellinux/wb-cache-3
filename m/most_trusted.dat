5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (it {{did not have a}} full-time executive director until 1960). The investigations were largely superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|The quarrel between Hamilton and Jefferson is {{the best}} known and {{historically}} the most important in American political history. Hamilton's and Jefferson's incompatibility was heightened by the unavowed wish of each to be Washington's principal and <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> advisor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
50|$|The names income {{trust and}} income fund are {{sometimes}} used interchangeably, even though <b>most</b> <b>trusts</b> have a narrower scope than funds.

5000|$|In Cayman it is {{possible}} to register a trust as an Exempt Trust [...] however it is voluntary registration regime only, so <b>most</b> <b>trusts</b> remain unregistered. As <b>most</b> Cayman <b>trusts</b> are therefore private arrangements, it is hard to give exact figures for the popularity of AP Trusts governed by Cayman law. However the number of licensed trust companies give us some indication of how the jurisdiction is viewed. As of 30 September 2012 the Fiduciary Services Division of CIMA, the body responsible for licensing and regulating trust companies in the Cayman Islands has supervisory responsibility for 146 active trust licences.|$|R

5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for martial law was to {{maneuver}} troops in readiness for a coup, {{and he had}} no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Federer lost a much-anticipated {{semifinal}} {{match to}} Novak Djokovic, after squandering two match {{points in the}} fifth set, which repeated his previous year's result against Djokovic and added a second loss from two sets up in Grand Slam tournament play to his record. With that loss, it meant that Federer did not win {{at least one of}} the four majors in 2011, the first time since 2002. Later that month in September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> and respected person in the world, next to Nelson Mandela.|$|E

Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at Compiègne where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside {{the safety of the}} Castle, Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trailed by the English as a heretic, and burned at the stake.

5|$|Justinian {{selected}} {{one of his}} <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> {{and talented}} generals, Belisarius, who had recently distinguished himself against the Persians and in {{the suppression of the}} Nika riots, to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous of the welfare of the local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population. Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, Antonina, and by Procopius, his secretary, who wrote the history of the war.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E

60|$|Doubts and suspicions which {{distract}} some lovers to imbecility {{only served}} to bring out Jim's great qualities. Where he trusted he was the <b>most</b> <b>trusting</b> fellow in the world; where he doubted he could be guilty of the slyest strategy. Once suspicious, {{he became one of}} those subtle, watchful characters who, without integrity, make good thieves; with a little, good jobbers; with a little more, good diplomatists. Jim was honest, and he considered what to do.|$|R

However, after his loss at Berat in 1455 at the hands of Isak bey, Skanderbeg was betrayed by some of his <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> officers, among them Moisi Arianit Golemi. Golemi returned the next year with an Ottoman force under his command, but was defeated at the Battle of Oranik and rejoined Skanderbeg's army. Later, the dissatisfied Hamza Kastrioti betrayed Skanderbeg and was offered joint-command with Isak bey over a second Ottoman invasion force.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one. In early July 1307, Edward I {{fell ill}} while once more campaigning in the north, and lay dying at Burgh by Sands near the Scottish border. According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} some of his <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> men around him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates with the care of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E

He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two of the guilds of the town in 1352.|$|E
