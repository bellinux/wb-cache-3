A source of chlorine gas, {{a source of}} inert gas {{and a source of}} hydrogen gas are connected to the bottom inlet through a <b>manifold</b> and a <b>heater.</b> A flow controler operates servos in a manner to continuously and sequentially suspend coal in the three gases. The sulfur content is reduced at least 50 % by the treatment...|$|R
5000|$|Polyphthalamide based resins are {{injection}} moulded into parts {{that are used}} {{in a wide variety of}} applications. Automotive uses include fuel and coolant lines, pump wear rings, motor bobbin parts, fuel line connectors, water <b>heater</b> <b>manifolds</b> fuel modules, fuel cut-off valves, thermostat housing, air coolers, coolant pumps, and LED headlights. In electronics, the high melting point of PPA allows SMD parts molded from PPA to be assembled using a lead-free soldering process. [...] PPAs are also used for USB Type-C connectors, LED mounts and cable/wire protection. Other applications for PPA based resins include gas pipes and supply lines for the oil industry (due to their ability to withstand high pressures), Medical applications such as tubing for catheters, in personal care, for toothbrush bristles as well as hairbrushes. PPAs are also used in sports equipment, valve bodies for showers, bushings and bearing pads in aircraft engines ...|$|R
40|$|The Velocity Control Propulsion Subsystem (VCPS) was {{designed}} the propulsion required for trajectory and lunar orbit corrections of the spacecraft. A GFE clamp assembly physically attaches the VCPS to the spacecraft and {{the unit is}} ejected after completing the required corrections. The VCPS is physically and functionally separated from the spacecraft except for the electrical and telemetry interfaces. A GFE transtage provides the superstructure on which the VCPS is assembled. The subsystem consists of two 5 foot pound rocket engine assemblies, 4 propellant tanks, 2 latching valves, 2 fill and drain valves, a system filter, pressure transducer, gas and propellant <b>manifolds</b> and electrical <b>heaters</b> and thermostats. The RAE-B VCPS program covered the design, manufacture and qualification of one subsystem. This subsystem was to be manufactured, subjected to qualification tests; and refurbished, if necessary, prior to flight. The VCPS design and test program precluded the need for refurbishing the subsystem and the unit was delivered to GSFC {{at the conclusion of}} the program...|$|R
40|$|A novel all-glass {{evacuated}} tube collector manifold header with an inserted tube is proposed {{in this paper}} which makes water in all-glass evacuated solar collector tube be forced circulated to improve the performance of solar collector. And a dynamic numerical model was presented for the novel all-glass {{evacuated tube}} collector <b>manifold</b> header water <b>heater</b> system. Also, a test rig was built for model validation and comparison with traditional all-glass evacuated tube collector. The experiment {{results show that the}} efficiency of solar water heater with a novel collector manifold header is higher than traditional all-glass evacuated tube collector by about 5 % and the heat transfer model of water heater system is valid. Based on the model, the relationship between the average temperature of water tank and inserted tube diameter (water mass flow) has been studied. The results show that the optimized diameter of inserted tube is 32 [*]mm for the inner glass with the diameter of 47 [*]mm and the water flow mass should be less than 1. 6 [*]Kg/s...|$|R
40|$|A {{proprietary}} heat-pipe Evacuated Tube Solar Water Heater (ETSWH) {{originally designed}} for collection of solar energy using forced fluid circulation was operated using thermosyphon fluid circulation. The thermal performance of this solar water heating system was monitored from October 2006 to June 2007. The ETSWH array was inclined with the expected collector outlet {{at a higher}} datum level than the expected collector inlet to provide a hydrostatic pressure differential across the manifold. During the monitoring period {{it was observed that}} thermosyphon flow was not always in the expected direction, with flow reversal occurring when the collector inlet temperature was greater than that of the outlet. When the evacuated tube solar water <b>heater</b> <b>manifold</b> was inclined at 1 ° to the horizontal, reverse fluid flow was observed to occur for 69 % of the monitored diurnal periods. Diurnal reverse circulation lowers system efficiency by reducing thermal stratification in the hot water storage tank via convective entrainment and mixing. The thermal performance of the ETSWH was monitored continuously from January 2007 to June 2007 with the manifold inclined at 5 ° to the horizontal. Over this time period it was found that fluid flow reversal arose for 22 % of the diurnal periods considered, resulting in a 47 % improvement in diurnal storage efficiency compared to when the system had its manifold inclined at 1 °. The long term diurnal storage efficiency of the optimised system inclined at 5 ” was measured as 66 %...|$|R
