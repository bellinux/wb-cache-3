5|$|While {{conducting}} {{an investigation of}} the Mint at San Francisco, deputy comptroller of the currency John Jay Knox began discussing the <b>monetary</b> <b>situation</b> with Louis A. Garnett, a man who had worked as both the treasurer and assayer of the San Francisco Mint. Garnett recommended that the United States mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to the Orient to compete with other countries' silver trade coins that were already popular in that region. Garnett's rationale was {{that the majority of the}} coins would be hoarded or melted in Asia and would never be presented for redemption, allowing the government to make a profit from the seigniorage. During his time in San Francisco, Knox also discussed the proposed commercial dollar with Henry Linderman, who was working as a special agent for the Treasury Department at that time. In 1870, Knox wrote a report to the Treasury and wrote the draft for a bill on coinage. Knox's bill was approved by George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury. After modification and review from current and former government officials, the bill was put before Congress.|$|E
5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the coin issuance {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to sequester more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the <b>monetary</b> <b>situation.</b> The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{adjusts the}} Chen and Giovannini (1992) {{methodology}} {{to estimate the}} unconditional distribution of exchange rates under a one-sided target zone regime, where a central bank commits itself to intervene on foreign exchange markets to prevent its currency to move beyond a previously announced target level vis-à-vis a specific foreign currency. An application of this methodology to the 2011 – 2015 EUR/CHF minimum exchange rate regime shows that the Swiss National Bank presumably intervened only at (or very close to) the floor level of EUR/CHF 1. 20 and not at a level significantly above that boundary. Hence, contrary to previous studies, the reported results accord with the predictions of the Krugman (1991) target zone model about the behavior of exchange rates, allowing investors to gain insights about the central bank’s policy function in extraordinary <b>monetary</b> <b>situations</b> and with important consequences for the descriptive validity of theoretical one-sided target zone models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{observation}} that the standard theory of high inflation, derived from Cagan's works in the Fifties, {{is not able to}} explain the main characteristics of the high inflationary process in the transition countries of Eastern Europe (Part I.). This literature, which is rooted in the quantity theory, focuses on the direct link from issue of money to price changes. This paper asserts that the understanding of high inflationary pressures in Eastern Europe involves a reversal of methodology for the two following reasons. First, the main question is not to know how the money creation acts on the price level but why governments of centrally planned economies raise seigniorage revenues to satisfy their financing requirements. Second, the standard monetary and finance modelling - in the line of the famous paper of 1956 - deals with short periods of extremely high <b>monetary</b> instability. Such <b>situations</b> do not correspond with the economic reality of the transition countries suffering of both persistent and high inflation.

50|$|Austrian School economists {{view the}} {{nationwide}} recession {{resulting from the}} Panic of 1819 as the first failure of expansionary monetary policy. This explanation {{is based on the}} Austrian theory of the business cycle. The US Government borrowed heavily to finance the War of 1812, which caused tremendous strain on the banks’ reserves of specie, leading to a suspension of specie payments in 1814, and then again during the recession of 1819-1821, violating contractual rights of depositors. The suspension of the obligation to redeem greatly spurred the establishment of new banks and the expansion of bank note issues, and this inflation of money encouraged unsustainable investments to take place. It soon became clear the <b>monetary</b> <b>situation</b> was threatening, and the Second Bank of the United States was forced to call a halt to its expansion and launch a painful process of contraction. There was a wave of bankruptcies, bank failures, and bank runs; prices dropped and wide-scale urban unemployment began.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{international}} transmission of economic shocks, their consequences for exchange rates and the reconciliation of exchange rate management with monetary policy. The theoretical {{part of the study}} consists of a mainstream model of two large, interdependent economies with special emphasis on the effects of various shocks on the inflation rate and exchange rate. The empirical application uses US and German data to shed light on the exchange rate implications of the choices faced by European and US monetary policymakers. The results suggest that the inflation rate is dominated by domestic supply shocks in both economies studied. When such shocks raise the domestic price level, the currency also depreciates. This aspect of the results means that, from a single-country perspective, monetary policy measures aimed at stabilizing the price level can be compatible with stabilization of the exchange rate as well. However, from the viewpoint of the other country, a conflict emerges between exchange rate and price stability. This difference causes a dilemma in international monetary coordination.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters that focus on topics in fields of experimental economics and health economics. The first chapter, “Do I Care if You Know I Betrayed You?”, examines how concern for others’ disutility from betrayal can affect the decision to repay trust in the trust game. We use a laboratory experiment to compare trustees’ behavior when betrayal is obfuscated to an identical <b>monetary</b> payoffs <b>situation</b> where betrayal is revealed. We find that more trustees choose to defect in our experiment when betrayal is obfuscated than when it is revealed. Our result suggests that concern for betrayal costs influences not only the decision to trust but also the decision to repay trust. The second chapter, “Increasing Organ Donation via Changes in the Default Choice or Allocation Rule”, utilizes a laboratory experiment {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of alternative public policies targeted at increasing the rate of deceased donor organ donation. The experiment includes treatments across different default choices and organ allocation rules inspired by the donor registration systems applied in different countries. Our results indicate that the opt-out with priority rule system generates the largest increase in organ donation relative to an opt-in only program. However, sizeable gains are achievable using either a priority rule or opt-out program separately, with the opt-out rule generating approximately 80 % of the benefits achieved under a priority rule program. The third chapter, “Improving the Approach to Organ Donor Registration”, proposes to improve organ donor registry by providing a persuasive message with the registration request. I designed a laboratory experiment to examine the impact of the persuasive message on donation decisions. The results indicate that the persuasive message has a positive impact on donation decisions in the early rounds of the experiment. Subjects were about 21 percent more likely to register as a donor in round 1 of the experiment when they were provided with a persuasive message. This behavioral difference across treatment decreased as subjects played more rounds, since subjects in the control treatment learned the information in the persuasive message through playing the game. We further find this treatment effect is mainly from subjects who are not organ donors in real life, while the treatment effect is very small for those who are self-reported organ donors...|$|R
