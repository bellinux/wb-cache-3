25|$|This {{was perhaps}} the <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> game played during the series.

25|$|As a {{synthesizer}} {{and electric}} keyboard player, Sun Ra ranks among {{one of the}} earliest and most radical pioneers. By the mid-1950s, he used a variety of electric keyboards, and almost immediately, he exploited their potential perhaps more than anyone, sometimes modifying them himself to produce sounds rarely if ever heard before. His live albums from the late 1960s and early 1970s feature some of the noisiest, <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> keyboard work ever recorded.|$|E

25|$|In his teen years, Cuccurullo {{became a}} devoted fan of Frank Zappa and began {{traveling}} to every show within 500 miles of his Brooklyn home. During the mid-1970s, he befriended {{several members of}} Zappa's band, including Terry Bozzio and Patrick O'Hearn. Over the next three years, he appeared with the band on stage {{at a couple of}} shows {{as well as in the}} 1979 Zappa film Baby Snakes (filmed October 1977).

25|$|In 2002, Sinclair {{scored the}} <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> {{of his own}} goals. After 3 minutes into a game at Middlesbrough, he coolly slotted the ball past keeper Ian Walker in a {{seemingly}} laid-back situation. This resulted in a 1–0 defeat for Leicester. This own goal against Middlesbrough {{was not to be}} his last for the club. In March 2004, Sinclair and his Leicester City teammates, Paul Dickov and Keith Gillespie were arrested in Spain over sexual assault charges, while on a training holiday. The charges were later dropped. Leicester released Sinclair {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|The first {{objective}} of the AFDL was the clearing of the string of rebel camps along the Rwandan border, {{setting the stage for}} what has been called one of the <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> and macabre situations of modern times. As the AFDL captured a series of Kivutian border towns in November 1996, the Hutu militants herded the refugees into Mugungu, creating a teeming mass of around half a million people who were prohibited from returning across the border by Hutu forces arrayed facing the border. The Hutu resistance was broken after the RPF swung southwest and flanked the Hutu force. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled back into Rwanda as the aid organizations and foreign countries stood impotent to affect the course of events.|$|E

25|$|The Cardinals {{followed}} with wins in Games 3 and 4, including another victory by Bob Gibson over Denny McLain in Game 4. Lou Brock stole three bases in Game 3 and had six steals {{in the first}} three games. In Game 4, McLain pitched poorly, giving up six runs in three innings. Game 4 also saw one of the <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> strategic battles in World Series history. The Cardinals led 4–0 in the third inning, when the game was delayed by rain for over an hour. When play resumed, the Tigers began to stall, hoping to have the game called before it became official. The Cardinals responded by intentionally trying to make outs to move the game forward. As a result of the tactics, Game 4 of the 1968 series was criticized as one of the worst games in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rudd won {{his only}} {{race of the}} year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of {{controversy}} in one of the <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd drove up to second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line he waved to his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians as one of the <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down {{to the middle of the}} ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E

5000|$|Allmovie rated it 2.5/5 {{stars and}} {{labeling}} it [...] "an especially unique {{entry into the}} slasher film cycle in the 1980s" [...] based on its influences, 1960s Gothic horror films. [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Unfolding deftly under Asher's direction, [...] "Night Warning" [...] combines darkly outrageous humor with persuasive psychological validity." [...] Variety called it [...] "a fine psychological horror film" [...] in which Tyrrell [...] "gives a tour-de-force performance".

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{cortical}} influences provided reasons {{to raise questions}} about the process of parturition among humans, characterized by a high encephalization quotient. Odent had observed that, in situations that are exceptionally rare, women can occasionally experience such a reflex, characterized by a birth after a short series of irresistible and powerful contractions without any room for voluntary movements. When a typical reflex occurs among humans there is an obvious elimination of neocortical control: women seem to be “on another planet”, talking nonsense, behaving in a way usually considered unacceptable regarding civilised women, finding themselves in the <b>most</b> unexpected, <b>bizarre,</b> often mammalian bending forward or quadrupedal postures. It appears that among humans the primary and necessary phenomenon is a reduced neocortical activity.|$|R
