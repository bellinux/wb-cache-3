5|$|Brahmousin cattle are {{a hybrid}} {{purebred}} breed of Brahman and Limousin first {{created in the}} USA in the late 1970s. The goal was to blend {{the best of the}} Limousin and Brahman traits to create a breed that has reproductive efficiency, <b>mothering</b> ability, good muscling and growth traits, and is adaptable to varying environmental conditions. Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Brahmousin {{are between}} one quarter and three {{quarters}} of the parent breeds with the objective of combining the muscle growth and meat quality of Limousins with the heat and parasite resistance, fast growth and good <b>mothering</b> ability of the Brahman. Brahmousin is formally recognised as a cattle breed in Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, <b>mothering</b> abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong <b>mothering</b> instincts.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around Â£1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before <b>Mothering</b> Sunday.|$|E

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says <b>mothering</b> reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
