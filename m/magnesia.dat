5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from <b>Magnesia</b> (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called <b>magnesia,</b> known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a <b>magnesia</b> negra (the black ore) from <b>magnesia</b> alba (a white ore, also from <b>Magnesia,</b> also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called <b>magnesia</b> negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name <b>magnesia</b> eventually was then used to refer only to the white <b>magnesia</b> alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus gives a {{detailed}} description of the Persian fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table). However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of <b>Magnesia,</b> approximately one third of the fleet was lost. Thus, by Herodotus's reckoning, the Persian fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|Hordern's mother, Margaret Murray, was {{descended from}} James Murray, an Irish {{physician}} whose research into digestion {{led to his}} discovery of the stomach aid milk of <b>magnesia</b> in 1829. The invention earned him a knighthood and brought the family great wealth. Margaret grew up in England, and attended St Audries School for Girls in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} Roman-Pergamese army {{started their}} march from Ephesus. They advanced inland passing <b>Magnesia</b> on the Maeander {{and into the}} territory of Alabanda where they were met by 1,000 infantry and 300 cavalry led by Attalus' brother. They then marched to Antiochia where they were met by Antiochus' son, Seleucus who offered corn {{as part of the}} treaty that was being concluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important {{exceptions to this}} and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, <b>magnesia,</b> potash, and soda.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of <b>Magnesia</b> in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|In 191 BC, Antiochus the Great, the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia, invaded Greece. The Romans {{decided to}} {{intervene}} and they defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae. The defeat by Rome forced the Seleucids to retreat back to Asia Minor. The Romans followed them across the Aegean Sea and together with their allies, Pergamum, they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of <b>Magnesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of <b>Magnesia,</b> and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la <b>Magnesia,</b> commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus II {{took a deep}} {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at <b>Magnesia</b> and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E
5|$|Antiochus III {{launched}} a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted {{the title of}} king (Greek: basileus) in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior. The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at <b>Magnesia</b> in 190BC. Phriapatius of Parthia (r. c.191–176BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I of Parthia (r. c.176–171BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.|$|E
5|$|Approaching Artemisium {{towards the}} end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of <b>Magnesia</b> and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After {{arriving}} at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but {{pulling out}} of {{recently}} pacified Spain and Gaul. They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome {{in the years after}} the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again {{for the first time since}} that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of <b>Magnesia,</b> resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following <b>Magnesia,</b> Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.|$|E
5|$|On the day Alexander was born, Philip was {{preparing}} a siege {{on the city}} of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of <b>Magnesia</b> {{to say that it}} had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{now turned}} its attentions to Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire to the east. After campaigns as far abroad as Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, Antiochus moved to Asia Minor and Thrace to secure several coastal towns, {{a move that}} brought him into {{conflict}} with Roman interests. A Roman force under Manius Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Thermopylae and forced him to evacuate Greece: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the Battle of the Eurymedon and Battle of Myonessus, and finally in a decisive engagement of the Battle of <b>Magnesia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of <b>Magnesia</b> and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at <b>Magnesia</b> and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians. Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet {{had been caught}} in a gale {{off the coast of}} <b>Magnesia,</b> losing many ships, but could still {{probably}} muster over 800 ships {{at the start of the}} battle. On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet. Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels. That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, <b>magnesia</b> and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The Seleucids {{sued for}} peace and began {{settling}} it with Scipio Asiaticus. In spring, the new consul, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, arrived {{to take control of}} the army from Scipio Asiaticus. He was sent to conclude the treaty that Scipio was arranging. However, he was not content with the task given to him and he started to plan a new war. He addressed the soldiers and congratulated them on their victory and then proposed a new war, against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor. The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of <b>Magnesia.</b> The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians, who had become rich from plundering their neighbours, and to gain glory for himself.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles left {{three sons}} by Archippe, {{daughter}} to Lysander of Alopece,—Archeptolis, Polyeuctus, and Cleophantus. Plato the philosopher mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant person. And Themistocles had two sons older than these three, Neocles and Diocles. Neocles {{died when he}} was young by the bite of a horse, and Diocles was adopted by his grandfather, Lysander. Themistocles had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother by another mother, and became priestess of Cybele; Italia was married to Panthoides, of the island of Chios; Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After the death of Themistocles, his nephew, Phrasicles, went to <b>Magnesia,</b> and married, with her brothers' consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest of all ten children.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in <b>Magnesia,</b> founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going on, but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of <b>Magnesia</b> was the {{concluding}} {{battle of the}} Roman–Seleucid War, fought in 190 BC near <b>Magnesia</b> ad Sipylum on the plains of Lydia between Romans, led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio and the Roman ally Eumenes II of Pergamum, and the army of Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire. A decisive Roman victory resulted in Roman domination over {{the internal affairs of}} {{a large part of the}} territory once controlled by the Seleucid Empire.|$|E

25|$|In 1817, {{he joined}} the Filiki Eteria secret society and {{returned}} to his homeland, recruiting others in preparation for an anti–Ottoman revolt. In 1821, with the start of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire he led the Greek insurgents in <b>Magnesia.</b> After the suppression of the revolt there, he went to Central Greece. He represented <b>Magnesia</b> in National Assemblies of Epidaurus and Astros and worked in commissions regarding military affairs and education. In 1827, he fell ill and his condition steadily deteriorated until his death on 24 June 1828 in Ermoupoli, Syros. Gazis died in poverty, having donated most of his savings to the Greek army.|$|E
25|$|Aluminosilicate glass: silica + alumina + lime + <b>magnesia</b> + {{barium oxide}} (BaO) + boric oxide (B2O3). Extensively used for fiberglass, used for making {{glass-reinforced}} plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.) and for halogen bulb glass. Aluminosilicate glasses are also resistant to weathering and water erosion.|$|E
25|$|Stabiliser: Glasses formed of silica {{and soda}} are {{naturally}} soluble, and require {{the addition of}} a stabiliser such as lime or <b>magnesia.</b> Lime was the primary stabiliser in use during the Roman period, entering the glass through calcareous particles in the beach sand, rather than as a separate component.|$|E
25|$|The Scythian {{women may}} have {{inspired}} the myth. From {{the early modern}} period, their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons {{were said to have}} founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, <b>Magnesia,</b> Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Faraday is {{best known}} for his work {{regarding}} electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a voltaic pile with seven ha'penny coins, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With this pile he decomposed sulfate of <b>magnesia</b> (first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).|$|E
25|$|The coal used in {{the next}} step must be low in {{nitrogen}} to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, {{in the form of}} limestone or chalk, should be low in <b>magnesia</b> and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a reverberatory furnace at about 1000°C.|$|E
25|$|Stabiliser: Lime or <b>magnesia.</b> In Anglo-Saxon glass {{the main}} {{stabiliser}} was lime. This {{may have been}} deliberately added to the glass batch, but may simply have been {{a component of the}} sand that was used. Roman writer Pliny stated that sand from the River Belus was particularly suitable for glass-making, this is a calcareous sand, rich in marine shells, and therefore lime.|$|E
25|$|In {{a message}} found after his death, Lébl {{assigned}} Czech publicist Radka Denemarková {{to write a}} book about him. She worked on it for eight years in Lébl's abandoned flat. In 2008, the book was published under the title Smrt, nebudeš se báti aneb Příběh Petra Lébla (Death, thou shall not be afraid alias the Story of Petr Lébl), and a year later it received the <b>Magnesia</b> Litera Award for Journalism.|$|E
25|$|Mid-7th century BC: In the war {{waged by}} the Ephesians against <b>Magnesia</b> on the Maeander, the Magnesian {{horsemen}} were each {{accompanied by a}} war dog and a spear-bearing attendant.

An epitaph records the burial of a Magnesian horseman named Hippaemon with his dog Lethargos, his horse, and his spearman.|$|E
25|$|This defeat proved crushing, and Antiochus {{was forced}} to retreat from Greece. The Romans {{under the command of}} Scipio Asiaticus {{followed}} him across the Aegean. The combined Roman-Rhodian fleet defeated the Seleucid fleet commanded by Hannibal at the Battle of the Eurymedon and at the Battle of Myonessus. After some fighting in Asia Minor, the Seleucids fought against the armies of Rome and Pergamum at <b>Magnesia.</b> The Roman-Pergamese army won the battle, and Antiochus {{was forced to}} retreat.|$|E
25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + <b>magnesia</b> (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3). Is transparent, easily formed and most {{suitable}} for window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. Container glass is a soda-lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
