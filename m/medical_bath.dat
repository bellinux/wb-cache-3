Between the hospital and the steps leading to the rock are the ruins of a large monastery. On the floors of the square building which is 125 ft on one side, are beautiful carvings and also are stone balustrades and guard stones. As this side is precipitous, the steps are on {{the eastern side of the}} slope, spacious and in 4 sections. The stairway has 1840 steps made of granite, leading to the summit. At the end of the first set of steps on the right side of the plain, is a small mountain peak. On this is situated the most famous Kantaka Cetiya.|$|E
40|$|To {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} clinical effects {{and safety of}} traditional Chinese <b>medical</b> <b>bath</b> therapy (TCMBT) combined with ultraviolet irradiation {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis. Electronic database retrieval was utilized. The foreign retrieval databases consulted included those of the Cochrane Library, PubMed and EMBASE; the domestic retrieval databases included the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (Sino-Med), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and the WangFang Database. Clinical randomized controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of TCMBT combined with ultraviolet irradiation in the treatment of psoriasis; the language of the retrieved articles was Chinese or English. Each database was searched from its inception to August 1, 2015. Two researchers independently collected the data and analyzed the methodology of the documented literature. The researchers conducted a meta-analysis with RevMan 5. 2. 3 software. According to the available literature, 25 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) of low research quality were conducted. According to the meta-analysis, the total effective rate of TCMBT combined with ultraviolet irradiation was relatively higher than that of ultraviolet irradiation alone. The recurrence rate, incidence of adverse reactions and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) for the combined therapy was lower than that of ultraviolet irradiation (P< 0. 05). For the treatment of psoriasis, the clinical effects and safety of TCMBT combined with ultraviolet irradiation are generally better than those of ultraviolet irradiation alone. However, the original literature was written in Chinese, {{and the quality of the}} studies was not high. Thus, it is difficult to confirm the clinical effects and safety of TCMBT combined with ultraviolet irradiation. It is necessary to conduct a scientific, normalized and high-quality RCT with multiple large samples and centers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Due to patients’ safety, {{increased}} {{blood pressure}} often restricts wider use of mineral water for therapeutic purposes in rehabilitation practice. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the effect of radon mineral water applied in the form of full baths on blood pressure in people with hypertension. Methods: A total of 27 patients, average age 58. 10 years with hypertension were included in the study. Balneotherapy was applied in the form of full baths with mineral radon water of neutral temperature. Values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before and after twenty minutes therapy on the first and fifth day of treatment. Results: On the first day of treatment there was no significant change in blood pressure after the application of full baths with mineral radon water of neutral temperature (systolic pressure t = 0. 697, not significant; diastolic pressure t = 0. 505, not significant). On the fi fth day of treatment there was no significant changes in blood pressure after the application of <b>medical</b> <b>baths</b> with mineral radon water of neutral temperature (systolic pressure t = 1. 372, not significant; diastolic pressure t = 1. 372, not significant). Conclusion: The significant increase of blood pressure in patients with mild and moderate hypertension is not expected when Fojnica water (radioactive mineral water) is being used in the form of full baths of neutral temperature, which allows a broader application of this balneo procedure in rehabilitation practice...|$|R

50|$|Oliver's {{position}} in the <b>medical</b> world of <b>Bath</b> involved him in trouble. Archibald Cleland, one of the hospital surgeons, was dismissed in 1743 {{on a charge of}} improper conduct, and the dismissal led to many pamphlets. An inquiry was held into the circumstances, under the presidency of Philip, brother of Ralph, Allen; this resulted in Oliver's conduct being highly commended. In 1757 Oliver and some other physicians in the city declined to attend any consultations with William Baylies, M.D. and Charles Lucas, M.D., in consequence of their reflections on the use and abuse of the waters, and their censures on the conduct of the physicians at the hospital. Much correspondence ensued, and it was published as proving the existence of a ‘physical confederacy in Bath.’ His medical skill is mentioned by Mrs. Anne Pitt. and by Mrs. Delany He and Peirce attended Ralph Allen in his last illness, and each received a complimentary legacy of £100.|$|R
50|$|A ray {{of light}} {{illuminates}} Mother-Superior Agnès Arnauld, who experienced on the ninth day of her novena for Champaigne's daughter, Sister Catherine de Sainte Suzanne, the hope that a cure would come for Sister Catherine. Catherine (seated, praying) was the painter's only surviving child, and had been suffering from a paralyzing illness. Until that point, prayer and <b>medical</b> treatments ("potions, <b>baths,</b> unctions, and thirty bleedings") had proven futile. After the Mother-Superior's novena, Sister Catherine soon attempted to walk, and found herself increasingly mobile; the illness no longer seemed present. The painting is a statement of gratitude by the father for the cure of his daughter. The miracle it portrays also symbolized hope {{for the cause of}} the Jansenists, who were subject to persecution by ecclesiastical and civil authorities. The Jansenists followed Cornelius Jansen, who reasserted the theology of St. Augustine, and were in conflict with the Jesuits. Their refusal to sign a document condemning five propositions found in Jansen's Augustinus resulted in their being deprived of the sacraments and confined to the abbey, which was eventually torn down.|$|R
40|$|Aim of the {{research}} : Evaluation studies {{have been carried out}} of the effectiveness of rehabilitation procedures with balneotherapy in osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK). Material and methods: Sulphide and hydrogen-sulphide salt waters, and kinesitherapy and chosen physiotherapy methods were used in treatment. Sixty-five people with osteoarthritis of the knee, with an average period of 20 years of duration of the disease, took part in the studies. These patients were divided into two groups. In the first group, baths in sulphide and hydrogen-sulphide salt waters with physiotherapy treatment were used. In the second group, analogous physiotherapy treatment was used, however, due to <b>medical</b> contraindications, sulphide <b>baths</b> were not used. Results : In both groups, a significant improvement of knee joint functions, alleviation of pain and improvement of endurance and aesthetics of walking were observed. Slightly better effects were observed in patients using baths in sulphide and hydrogen-sulphide salt waters. Conclusions: In view of the achieved improvement of the clinical state in patients with OAK, this form of comprehensive sanatorium rehabilitation is recommendable...|$|R
50|$|The Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners' Royal Benevolent Society or the Shipwrecked Mariners for short, is a {{national}} charity founded in 1839, which operates throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, whose purpose is to provide help to former merchant seamen, fishermen and their widows and dependants who are in need. It was founded at the instigation of Mr John Rye, a philanthropic retired <b>medical</b> man of <b>Bath,</b> Somerset and his servant Mr Charles Gee Jones, born in Weston-super-Mare , a former Bristol Pilot and Landlord of the Pulteney Arms in Bath, following the tragic loss of life from the Clovelly fishing fleet in a severe storm in November 1838. Aided by Sir Jahleel Brenton, at that time Governor of Greenwich Hospital, Mr. Rye succeeded in establishing the Society, and of collecting a respectable sum as a first subscription, initially by going {{from house to house}} in Bath collecting half crowns. The portrait (below) of Mr Rye and Mr Gee Jones was painted to commemorate the founding of the Society, which now hangs in the boardroom of the Society's Headquarters in Chichester.|$|R
40|$|To examine {{environmental}} feature utilization (EFU) and {{the types}} and prevalence of performance difficulties during a videotaped bath transfer and to determine the personal characteristics associated with total EFU and performance difficulties. DESIGN : Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING : Two congregate housing facilities in southeastern Michigan. PARTICIPANTS : Eighty-nine older adults who reported independence in bathing. MEASUREMENTS : Trained video coders recorded EFU (defined as upper extremity contact with features in the environment) and rated performance difficulties (defined as lack of fluid movement or difficulty negotiating the environment). EFU was measured by determining whether features used were safe (i. e., designed {{for use as a}} transfer support) or unsafe and by total EFU (i. e., number of environmental features used during the transfer). Personal characteristics included self-reported <b>medical</b> conditions, <b>bath</b> transfer difficulty, functional mobility, lower extremity strength, range of motion functional impairment, and falls efficacy. RESULTS : For participants with a tub-shower, safe EFU was higher than unsafe EFU (85 % vs 19 %; P <. 001). Participants with shower stalls had the same rate of safe and unsafe EFU (71 %). In multiple regression analysis, self-reported bath transfer difficulty was associated with total EFU (P =. 01). One-third of the sample had performance difficulties. In multivariate analysis, range of motion functional impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 13. 49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 11 – 163. 53) and lowest quartile in falls efficacy scores (OR= 5. 81, 95 % CI= 1. 24 – 27. 41) were associated with performance difficulties. CONCLUSION : Unsafe EFU and performance difficulties were common in independently bathing older adults. Self-reported bath transfer difficulty appears to be a good indicator of high total EFU and may be used as a screening question for clinicians. Important strategies to reduce unsafe EFU and to increase falls efficacy include removing shower sliding glass doors and training older adults in safe transfer techniques...|$|R
5000|$|At each {{of these}} conferences, brief reports on {{conditions}} in their respective countries {{were made by the}} delegates from foreign countries and the one delegate representing the US, Louise DeKoven Bowen, appointed by President Harding. A visiting delegate from Poland paid a high tribute to the participation of the United States {{in the work of the}} great World War. In her own words, [...] "Were it not for the American Red Cross, there would probably not be alive in Poland today, a single child." [...] The delegate from Argentina contrasted the objective of international organizations of men with that of women's organizations. [...] "Not commerce, which men have called the blood of nations, nor any other material consideration," [...] she said, [...] "but international peace, permanent peace, is the ultimate objective of international conferences of women, such as the PanAmerican Conference." [...] In the conference on Traffic in Women, a hopeful note was sounded by the delegate from Panama, who presented clearly and in forceful terms, the spiritual aspect of the problem. Again at this conference Graciela Mandujano, of Chile, a student at Columbia University, spoke of the White Cross League, organized by women of her nation for protective work among girls. A high water mark in progress was reported by Aurora Herrera de Nóbregas, of the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico, with its budget of $3,000,000 for education. Shower <b>baths,</b> <b>medical</b> attention and play grounds are a part of the equipment of the schools. Another Mexican delegate reported 1,000 free beds for maternity service in Mexico City. All delegates with the exception of Maria Clotilde Voga, of Nicaragua, stressed the importance of government aid in child welfare work. She said, in part, [...] "We do not need state legislation to take care of children. The women of my country without such aid, are sponsoring day nurseries, schools of hygiene, and schools for special care of children." [...] Matilde de Carbo said: [...] "It is almost a disgrace in Ecuador to have less than six children in a family, and often there are a dozen." [...] She outlined legislation projected by women of her country. Eighty-nine foreign newspapers in 15 countries requested current reports for publication.|$|R
