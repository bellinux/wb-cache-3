5|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of people {{employed}} in the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> industry in Ohio was reported to be around 31,000, down from about 40,000 throughout the 1990s, while in the motor vehicle parts production industry in Ohio, in December 1997, employment stood at approximately 122,000 employees; however, that number dropped by about 26% to 90,000 employees by 2004. Despite the growth facts above, the loss of employment is more likely to directly affect Ohio's economy. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information estimates that there will be 3,300 less assembly employees and 2,400 less parts manufacturing employees in 2012 than 2002. Major firms operating in the state include Ford, Honda, and General Motors. Some major <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> production plants in the state include the Toledo Complex, Lordstown Assembly, Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant, Ohio Assembly, and Toledo North Assembly.

50|$|In New Zealand, {{during the}} 1960s a local company, JNZ Manufacturing Ltd {{assembled}} the 'ÄŒezeta' {{under the name}} 'N-Zeta'. It was fitted with a larger, 200cc two stroke motor.New Zealand production was from 1958 or 1959 to perhaps 1964. The point of New Zealand production was that high import duties were placed on imported <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> New Zealand <b>assembly</b> reduced the imported cost and hence the duty. Further, New Zealand manufacture of components further reduced the duty. The JNZ Man Ltd apparently achieved 50% New Zealand manufacture by value, with tyres, seat, trim, lights, controls etc. The 501 model is identified visually by a center skirt horn and dual exhausts. It produced 8 bhp and could go 50 mph. The 502 model is identified visually by no center skirt horn and a single exhaust. Output was 9.5 bhp, and top speed was 59mph.

40|$|Intermediate parts {{contribute}} roughly 70 {{percent of}} the value added in production of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Carmakers like Ford and General Motors once made many of these parts in-house, but now procure most of them from independent producers. Outsourcing of parts extends globally, with more than one-fourth of the parts in vehicles assembled in the United States imported from other countries. This paper describes the growing role of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> parts imports for U. S. based light <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly.</b> Imports of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> parts have increased to both substitute for U. S. -based parts production {{as well as to}} complement U. S. -based vehicle production of foreign producers. The paper assesses the effect of imports on production costs by distinguishing highand low-cost source countries. This analysis is supplemented with anecdotal evidence on two key measurement issues: the globalization of supply chains as well as the relocation of production from a developed to a less developed country and attendant changes in the structure of production costs.
