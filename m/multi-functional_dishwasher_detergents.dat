50|$|Users operate dishwashers by {{scraping}} {{food from}} dirty dishes, loading {{them into the}} dishwasher racks, adding <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent,</b> turning on the device, then removing the clean dishes.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> are {{incompatible}} {{for use with}} silver, brass, cast iron, bronze, pewter, and goldleaf. They can also harm disposable plastic, anything wood, knives with hollow handles, and fine glassware.|$|R
5000|$|National {{voluntary}} ban on phosphates in <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> {{is implemented}} {{by members of}} the American Cleaning Institute (formerly the Soap and Detergent Association), a manufacturer's trade group representing most detergent companies.|$|R
50|$|Dishwashers are {{designed}} to work using specially formulated <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent.</b> Over time, many regions have banned the use of phosphates in detergent because wastewater from dishwashers was polluting water and harming ecosystems.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{announced}} that the European Parliament had ordered a ban of phosphates in consumer laundry detergent by June 2013 and a ban in <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> by January 2017.|$|R
50|$|Gansler {{also led}} the {{successful}} charge to have phosphates banned from <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> and arsenic banned from chicken feed, and helped secure standing for environmental groups to sue polluters in State court.|$|R
50|$|Anti-foams {{are added}} in {{certain types of}} {{detergents}} to reduce foaming that might decrease {{the action of the}} <b>detergent.</b> For example, <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> have to be low foaming for the dishwasher to work properly.|$|R
5000|$|These are {{a primary}} component, in older and original-style <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> powders [...] Highly {{alkaline}} salts attack and dissolve grease, but are extremely corrosive (fatal) if swallowed. Salts used may include metasilicates, alkali metal hydroxides, Sodium carbonate etc.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> {{contains}} complex phosphates, as {{they have}} several properties that aid in effective cleaning. However, the same chemicals {{have been removed from}} laundry detergents in many countries as a result of concerns raised about the increase in algal blooms in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see eutrophication). Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent, and two US states (Maryland and New York) ban phosphates in commercial dishwashing. Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents.</b>|$|R
50|$|MonoSol {{is one of}} the {{companies}} that develops the water-soluble film used for laundry and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> packs, used by brands including Tide, with roughly $250 million in annual sales and controlling around 90-percent of the market. The film is designed to be soluble within cold water.|$|R

5000|$|In the 21st century {{phosphates}} {{began to}} be reduced in percentage terms as an ingredient, leading to a New York Times report that said [...] "low- or phosphate-free <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> it tested, including those from environmentally friendly product lines that {{have been on the}} market for years, none matched the performance of products with phosphates".|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} the ecotoxicity of <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents.</b> Indeed, despite the high consumption of such products, available information regarding their environmental impact is still limited. Thus, twenty {{five of the}} most representative products available on the French market were selected, covering the different <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> categories : 'multibenefit' tablets, 'classical' products (tablets and powder) and 'gel' (both 'classical'products and 'gel'need the use of rinse aid). Our approach was taken into account the ecotoxicity of solutions simulating a wash cycle in a dishwasher in typical use conditions, as recommended by the manufacturer. The ecotoxicity of these 'washing solutions'was determined by performing a battery of aquatic bioassays from two trophic levels (algae and micro-invertebrates) covering both acute and chronic endpoints. In addition, {{the assessment of the}} ecotoxicity of two hand-dishwashing detergents, ten rinse aids (alone) and four dishwashing detergents (without addition of rinse aid in the 'washing solution') was performed. Both approach and selected battery of bioassays were relevant and allowed the classification of the different <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents.</b> Mostly, it was shown that there production of C. dubia was the most sensitive endpoint compared with the inhibition of the mobility of D. magna and the growth of the algae P. subcapitata. The 'washing solutions'prepared with hand dishwashing detergents were found to be more toxic than those prepared with <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents,</b> except for the gel products. Regarding the automatic dishwasher products, it was shown that the ecotoxicity of 'washing solutions'from the 'gel'products was higher than the ecotoxicity recorded for 'classical'products and 'multibenefit' tablets. This study also revealed that the ecotoxicity of 'classical'tablets was, most of the time, higher than the ecotoxicity of 'multibenefit' tablets. Additional studies confirmed that the ecotoxicity recorded for 'classical'products was mostly due to the addition of rinse aid in the 'washing solution'. These results suggested that the ecotoxicity recorded for ecolabelled products should be weighted regarding to the intrinsic ecotoxicity of the rinse aids which are currently not covered by 'European Ecolabel'...|$|R
50|$|Food {{additives}} {{generally do}} not fall under this category, unless they have a use other than for human consumption. Additives in general (e.g. stabilizers and coloring found in washing powder and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents)</b> make the classification of household chemicals more complex, {{especially in terms of}} health - some of these chemicals are irritants or potent allergens - and ecological effects.|$|R
50|$|Today, Persil {{is sold in}} powder, liquid detergent, liquid capsule, liqui-gel, and tablet forms. There are biological, non-biological (with {{and without}} enzymes, respectively) and colour care (biological and bleach-free) {{formulations}} as well. The Persil line also includes specialist care products for wool and silk items. In the UK, Unilever uses the Persil brand to market {{a wide range of}} washing up liquids and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inexpensive powders {{may contain}} sand. Such {{detergents}} may harm {{the dishes and}} the <b>dishwasher.</b> Powdered <b>detergents</b> {{are more likely to}} cause fading on china patterns.|$|R
50|$|A mix {{of water}} and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> is pumped {{to one or more}} {{rotating}} spray arms, which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water is pumped in and a rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a rinse aid is used to eliminate water spots for streak-free dishes and glassware resulting from hard water or other reasons.|$|R
50|$|The best <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> {{would be}} those that clean dishes the best, leave the least cleaner after rinsing, have {{versatility}} in cleaning {{various types of}} dish surfaces and food, are easiest to use, and the best value for price. There is variation in how effective different detergents are in removing dried food from glass and baked-on sticky food from pots. In the course of washing, a better detergent will both prevent washed-away food from redepositing on the dishes, and also prevent mineral accumulation or discoloration of the dishes.|$|R
50|$|Washing out {{mouth with}} soap {{is meant to}} be unpleasant, but is usually not {{intended}} to cause death or serious harm. Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents. Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many automatic <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> and laundry detergents. Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid hand soaps may cause harmful effects including vomiting, diarrhea, irritation of the lining of the mouth and digestive tract, and in rare instances, pulmonary aspiration. This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.|$|R
5000|$|With his team, Weatherby {{developed}} {{a solution that}} employed a category of dyes {{that could be used}} in products containing bleach and, at the same time, would give the soap a lemon-yellow color that would not stain dishes. Before his invention, pigments were used in such solutions that often stained dishes and dishwasher interiors. With fellow inventor Brian J. Roselle, he received U.S. patent No. 4,714,562, issued on December 22, 1987, for his breakthrough [...] "Automatic <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> composition." [...] The solution serves as the basic formula behind all of today's [...] "lemon-scented" [...] cleaning products containing bleach.|$|R
50|$|Phosphates {{are found}} in many <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents,</b> laundry detergents, and {{bathroom}} cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them fertilizers, nutrients, and wastes from the land. Phytoplankton and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and hypoxic zones become apparent.|$|R
40|$|In 2010, {{seventeen}} US states implemented mandatory bans on {{the sale}} of phosphates in automatic <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent,</b> due to concern over the adverse effects that arise from excess phosphorus loads to our lakes, rivers, and streams. 1 Excess phosphorus can lead to harmful algal blooms, excessive aquatic plant growth, and alterations to the composition of aquatic species, among other changes. Accordingly, the US EPA considers nutrient pollution {{to be one of the}} most important environmental challenges we face in the twenty-first century (USEPA 2009). Effectively and efficiently addressing this challenge requires a sound understanding of phosphorus control policies. We find that the effectiveness of these bans to reduce phosphorus pollution is highly dependent upon regulations that are in place at wastewater treatment facilities and that pre-existing regulations at certain wastewater treatment facilities render these bans ineffective precisely in the areas in which phosphorus pollution is most problematic...|$|R
50|$|Lead crystal {{should not}} be cleaned in a {{dishwasher}} as the corrosive effect of <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> is high on such types of glass - that is, it will quickly go 'cloudy'. In addition, {{the lead in the}} crystal glass can be converted into a soluble form, which could endanger the health of subsequent users. Some items can be damaged if washed in a dishwasher because {{of the effects of the}} chemicals and hot water. Aluminium items will discolor. Saucepan manufacturers often recommend handwashing due to the harsh effects of the chemicals on the pan coatings. Valuable items, such as antiques or hand-painted items, should only be washed manually as they may be dulled or damaged, and detergents will gradually fade the glazing and print. Sterling silver and pewter will oxidize and discolour from the heat. Furthermore, pewter has a low melting point and may warp in some dishwashers.|$|R
50|$|The user scrapes dishes clean, such as {{by pushing}} uneaten food from a plate into a waste {{container}} as food waste. From the early 2010s, manufacturers have designed consumer dishwashers for use without pre-rinsing or pre-washing, so after scraping the user places dishes into the dishwasher. Dishwashers {{are designed to}} hold different dishes in different places. For the most common installed two-rack consumer style of dishwasher, the user loads cups, bowls, and small dishes onto the top rack. Eating utensils go in the bottom rack into a container, with pointed ends down for safety. Some dishwashers have a third rack for utensils. Heavier dishes go on the bottom rack, with large pots facing downward toward the spray nozzle. After the dishwasher is loaded, the user puts <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> into the machine. Contemporary dishwashers use sensors {{to determine how much}} washing is required, and when they finish, will provide clean dishes.|$|R
40|$|As {{the use of}} {{consumer}} products grows, quality control becomes a more and more important aspect. In this thesis, three different high volume consumer products are investigated {{through the use of}} optical instrumentation; these are hair dye, <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> and clothes detergent. A bespoke Raman tweezer system was built around microfluidic channels to investigate the reactions which occurin a dishwasher via flowing solutions past a trapped species made from acrylic, a common problem item in dishwashers. It was found {{that it is possible to}} predict some of the reaction processes via this method, although the particle build-up can lead to some instabilities in the system. An absorbance spectrometer system was also built around microfluidic channels to investigate the reactions which develop the colour of hair dye, to advance a current method by Proctor and Gamble. Another spectrometer system built to study the reflection and transmission of light by stained fabric was developed to quantify the performance of fabric detergents...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve water quality the Netherlands will have to reduce {{the high levels of}} {{nutrients}} in its surface waters. This report introduces a balancing framework {{that can be used for}} deciding upon/between national and/or regional measures. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted on 23 October 2000. The main objectives of this directive are to restore polluted waters to an acceptable status and to provide the assurance that the good status of these waters will be maintained. A major problem facing the Netherlands is the high levels of nutrients in the surface waters. These high nutrient concentrations are the primary causal factors for the transition of clear-water lakes and ditches, which provide habitats for water plants, pike and the stickleback, into turbid, algae- or duckweed-dominated waters. Various measures can be implemented to lower the high levels of nutrients and consequently restore these surface waters; these include the removal of duckweed and/or the introduction of pike into the body of water, the use of phosphate-free <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> and/or stricter adaptations of the manure and fertilizer policy. Some of these measures are best implemented at the national level, while others are strongly dependent on the regional situation. Governmental policy is generally determined at the national level, while municipalities, provinces, water boards and/or nature organizations determine 'regional' measures. By order of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) of the Netherlands, the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) has developed a balancing framework aimed at differentiating national and regional measures. In accordance with this framework, measures that reduce the direct emissions from nutrients to soil and water, such as the manure and fertilizer policy or phosphate-free <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergents</b> - termed 'generic' measures - are best implemented at the national level. In contrast, measures that reduce the indirect loads to the surface waters or limit the ecological effects of the nutrient concentrations, such as the removal of duckweed of the introduction of pike, are usually regarded as being 'regional'. For most measures the balancing framework works well, as has been verified in a test conducted by independent experts...|$|R
500|$|Reverend Lovejoy's {{sermon on}} [...] "" [...] almost sends the entire {{congregation}} to sleep. After church Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield dump {{to dispose of}} their old Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent</b> known as Mr. Sparkle. The face of the character on the box of the detergent strongly resembles Homer. Meanwhile, Marge becomes concerned with Lovejoy's lack of enthusiasm about helping people. He explains to Marge that he was enthusiastic about the ministry and helping his fellow man when he first arrived in Springfield. However, his passion for helping people gradually degraded as he dealt with Ned Flanders and his constant complaints over trivial and common issues. Marge begins working for the Church as [...] "The Listen Lady", listening to people's problems and helping solve them. Reverend Lovejoy soon realizes his inadequacy and begins to feel depressed. While he is alone in the church the stained glass images of saints appear and chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation.|$|R
5000|$|Silicate filming, etching, and {{accelerated}} crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or [...] "oil-film" [...] effect on glassware, and progresses into a [...] "milky" [...] or [...] "cloudy" [...] appearance (which {{is not a}} deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution. It becomes less soluble {{in the presence of}} silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the <b>dishwasher</b> <b>detergent).</b> Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) less marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks {{as a result of the}} items' manufacturing. Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.|$|R
