Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes {{exists in}} four {{distinct}} versions. The original two-plinth Xerxes (1985) was discontinued after about eight years' production, after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) was launched. On the 10th {{anniversary of the}} company (1995), Roksan reprised the entry-level Xerxes turntable with a 3-plinth design named Xerxes.X. Its top plinth houses the tonearm and the main bearing, and is isolated from the base by five Blobs, which also allow the plinth to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and main bearing. The motor is driven by XPS V Reference <b>motor</b> <b>drive,</b> which receives power from DS1.5 Reference Power Supply.|$|E

25|$|Compressors used in {{refrigeration}} {{systems are}} {{often described as}} being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> are situated {{in relation to the}} gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is hermetically sealed compressor, while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of hermetic compressors {{is that the}} <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared {{to the value of}} the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device.|$|E
25|$|A CNC wood router is a {{computer}} controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part {{that is to be}} created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.|$|E

500|$|The building, itself, is in a {{traditional}} observatory design, Colonial Revival style, following a T-plan. The dome rises [...] in the air. The observatory was built on a one story T-plan, facing north, of buff-colored Roman brick (from Indiana) and features limestone lintels and sills. The cross of the T is [...] long east to west and [...] deep, its stem is located to the south, centered along the east-west axis and is [...] deep by [...] wide. The octagonal observation tower rises [...] into the air {{at the intersection of}} the T where it becomes a dome and continues to a height of [...] At floor level of the second equatorial room a balustrade circles around the exterior of the tower. The tower is capped by a great circular limestone plate, which carries the dome track. Internally, the diameter of the dome is [...] and its zenith [...] above the floor. The dome slit, which still operates, has an opening of [...] and can be opened or closed by hand in seconds. The dome tower and equatorial room are original save a <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> which replaced the old rope and sheave method of rotating the dome.

2500|$|With {{suitable}} port connections, {{the devices}} may {{be either a}} compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., [...] ) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about [...] in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some stepper motor {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|E

Six of the sections could fold underneath two—in 2½ minutes—making the Civic Arena the world's first major indoor sports stadium with a retractable roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections.

2500|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. [...] PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. [...] Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". [...] Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. [...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. [...] Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.|$|E

The need for the hydraulic spindle arises because of the limitations placed on conventional electric <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> spindles by the low cutting power and the presence of vibrational phenomena associated with voltage frequency at high rotational speeds. Also, the electric motors are usually large and expensive when power requirements are moderately high. In contrast, hydraulic <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> spindles promise a distinct increase in spindle life over the conventional electric <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> spindles.
