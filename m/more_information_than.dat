5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

40|$|In {{studies of}} autobiographical memory, women {{typically}} remember <b>more</b> emotional <b>information</b> <b>than</b> do men. The present study evaluated whether women recall <b>more</b> emotional <b>information</b> <b>than</b> men when {{the content of}} an event is controlled. Participants read a script containing emotional and neutral information, under instructions to prepare advice for the characters addressing either interpersonal issues (emotional focus), concrete plans (neutral focus), or with no particular topic suggested (undirected focus). After writing out advice, on a surprise memory test women recalled <b>more</b> emotional <b>information</b> <b>than</b> men in all focus conditions with no deficit in neutral recall. Women recalled <b>more</b> neutral <b>information</b> <b>than</b> men in the neutral focus condition. A measure of emotional sensitivity mediated the gender difference in emotional recall suggesting that memory for emotional information is not solely a function of gender. In recent {{years there has been}} a growing interest in the relation between gender and memory. A number of studies demonstrate that men and women’s memories for personal experiences (autobiographical memories) and laboratory materials differ in quantitative and qualitative ways. In studies of autobiographical memory, men’s and women’s accounts of personal experiences differ in richness and complexity. Women’s autobiographical memories are longer and more detaile...|$|R

25|$|The main {{motivation}} for introducing this component was {{the observation that}} some (in particular, highly intelligent) patients with amnesia, who presumably have no ability to encode new information in long-term memory, nevertheless have good short-term recall of stories, recalling much <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> could {{be held in the}} phonological loop.|$|E

25|$|Inductive {{reasoning}} contrasts {{strongly with}} deductive reasoning in that, {{even in the}} best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, {{the truth of the}} premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.|$|E

25|$|Eliminating losing {{candidates}} in reverse {{order of their}} Borda count, STV-B, affects some issues of STV. Borda counts include deeper preferences, and so contain <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> is held in current first place votes. Borda counts would capture the popularity of that Condorcet winner described in the preceding paragraph, preventing immediate elimination. Elimination by Borda counts creates other features for STV including promotion of moderate candidates and increased stability {{in the face of}} small changes of preferences.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{in scientific}} measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate {{at least one}} additional digit {{if there is any}} information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).|$|E
25|$|The {{peptides}} may be desalted {{to remove}} ionizable contaminants {{and subjected to}} MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Direct measurement of the masses of the peptides may provide sufficient information to identify the protein (see Peptide mass fingerprinting) but further fragmentation of the peptides inside the mass spectrometer {{is often used to}} gain information about the peptides’ sequences. Alternatively, peptides may be desalted and separated by reversed phase HPLC and introduced into a mass spectrometer via an ESI source. LC-ESI-MS may provide <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> MALDI-MS for protein identification but uses more instrument time.|$|E

25|$|Several {{companies}} offered optional commercial feelies (physical props {{associated with}} a game).

When writing this game, {{it was not possible to}} include all of the information in the limited (80KB) disk space, so Infocom created the first feelies for this game; extra items that gave <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> could be included within the digital game itself. These included police interviews, the coroner's findings, letters, crime scene evidence and photos of the murder scene.|$|E
25|$|It was rumoured that Robertson was {{angling for}} Haig’s job in July, {{although}} there is no clear evidence that this was so. This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, {{at a time when the}} German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig’s daily telegrams to him contained little <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>than</b> the daily press releases. “Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!” was Haig’s comment on one such letter (29 July). F.E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (then out of office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain’s losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and Esher wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig’s back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him “the necessary data with which to reply to the swines” (7 and 8 August).|$|E
