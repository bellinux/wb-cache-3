There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne <b>microbial</b> <b>community</b> may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a <b>microbial</b> <b>community,</b> first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal <b>microbial</b> <b>community</b> profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that plant-soil {{interactions}} {{play an important role in}} determining the impact of global change phenomena on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Little is known, however, about the individual and relative importance for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling of non-random changes in plant and soil communities that result from global change phenomena, such as fertilization and agricultural intensification. We set up a field-based mesocosm experiment in which we re-inoculated soil with contrasting <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> taken from extensively managed and from intensively managed grasslands. In a full-factorial design, we subsequently established plant communities representative of intensively and extensively managed grasslands and imposed a fertilization treatment. We then measured plant biomass and diversity, and leaching of C and N as key measures of C and N loss. We hypothesized that non-random changes in both <b>microbial</b> and plant <b>communities</b> would impact C and N leaching, but via different mechanisms. We predicted that plant communities representative of extensively managed grassland would reduce C and N leaching directly through increased water or N uptake, or indirectly via promoting <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> that immobilize C and N, whereas plant communities of intensively managed grassland would have the opposite effect. We also hypothesized that <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> of extensively managed grassland would feed back positively to plant diversity and that matching' plant and <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> would reduce C and N leaching. We found that both plant and <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> from extensively managed grassland reduced C and N leaching, especially when matched'. Plant community effects on C and N leaching operated directly through root C inputs and N uptake, rather than through changes in soil <b>microbial</b> <b>communities.</b> In contrast, <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> modified C and N leaching both directly by immobilization and indirectly through modifying plant community composition. Synthesis. Our results show that changes in plant and <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> both individually and interactively modify C and N loss from grasslands.

We compare soil <b>microbial</b> <b>communities</b> from paired reference and dairy manure-exposed sites across the US. Given that manure exposure has been shown to elicit increased antibiotic resistance in soil <b>microbial</b> <b>communities,</b> we expect that manure-exposed sites will exhibit 1) compositionally different soil <b>microbial</b> <b>communities,</b> with shifts toward taxa known to exhibit resistance; 2) greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes; and 3) corresponding maintenance of antibiotic resistance would lead to decreased microbial efficiency. We found that bacterial and fungal communities differed between reference and manure-exposed sites. Additionally, β-lactam resistance gene ampC was 5. 2 -fold greater under manure exposure, potentially due to the use of cephalosporin antibiotics in dairy herds. Finally, ampC abundance was positively correlated with indicators of microbial stress, and microbial mass-specific respiration, which increased 2. 1 -fold under manure exposure.

2500|$|This {{high rate}} of {{decomposition}} {{is the result of}} phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities. In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon. The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the <b>microbial</b> <b>community</b> is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen. High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants [...] through surface or ground waters. [...] The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.|$|E
