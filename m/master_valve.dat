2500|$|In May 1965 five infill wells were sabotaged. The {{incident}} {{occurred during the}} reign of King Idris before the 1969 coup led by Colonel Qaddafi. The wild wells were not reported in the news media and the perpetrations not revealed. Until the Persian Gulf War of 1991 this was the largest simultaneous well fire ever. In recognition of the number and ferocity of the blowouts BP called for the fire fighter Red Adair plus his lieutenants Boots & Coots. On arrival the crew drove around the field to assess the task. One of the wells had not caught fire but was erupting crude. Living up to his larger than life reputation mirrored by John Wayne in the film Hellfighters Adair approached the well and closed the undamaged <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> saying (reputedly) [...] "one down four to go". On return to the main camp he informed BP that he could cap the wells unaided and dispatched Boots & Coots back to Houston. He extinguished the fires in 3 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{sophisticated}} surface tree {{will have}} at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term [...] "Christmas tree"). The two lower valves are called the master valves (upper and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are never opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces. The lower <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> will normally be manually operated, while the upper <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it {{to be used as}} a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated wing valve is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. Hydraulic operated wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action.|$|E
50|$|Braided line is {{more complex}} than {{slickline}} due to the need for a grease injection system in the rigup to ensure the BOP can seal around the braided contours of the wire. It also requires an additional shear-seal BOP as a tertiary barrier as the upper <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> on the Christmas tree can only cut slickline. Braided line includes both the core-less variety used for heaving fishing and electric-line used for logging and perforating.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Two {{patients}} who suffered acute failure of their St Jude Medical <b>Masters</b> aortic <b>valve</b> prostheses due to leaflet arrest that were unrelated to suture material are presented. It {{was hypothesized that}} the valves failed because force applied to bear upon the valve annulus caused the hinge mechanism to become restricted or to arrest. Methods: A {{study was designed to}} measure the force that would cause leaflet arrest in three sizes of St Jude Medical <b>Masters</b> <b>valves</b> and CarboMedics mechanical valves. A specially manufactured pushrod device was used to apply a variable force to the sewing cuff, low annulus level, or to the pivot guards of all the valves. Results: For every valve size tested, the St Jude Medical <b>Masters</b> <b>valves</b> required significantly less force applied than did the CarboMedics valves to cause one or both leaflets to arrest (P < 0. 0004). Conclusions: A force applied on the valve ring of mechanical valves can cause leaflet arrest. The force required to arrest the leaflets is within an order of magnitude of that measured in other in vivo animal studies. We conclude that force on the valve rings in patients after aortic valve surgery could cause leaflet malfunction and even arrest in some patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|To {{accommodate}} {{extremely high}} temperatures and seldom corrosive and hostile reservoir fluids, the wellhead assembly {{has to be}} diligently selected. The choice should be a compromise between wellhead quality, cost, and safety requirements. All wellhead implemented into geothermal wells have to follow API and ASME regulations. The wellheads used for both IDDP projects were ANSI class 1500 <b>master</b> <b>valves</b> with ANSI class 2500 flanges, whereas the wellhead employed for the recent Venelle- 2 project was API class 10, 000 rating (Bertani et al. 2018; Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017). In the Venelle- 2 well, the base flange was realized with high corrosion resistance material. In both mentioned projects, steel cladding was realized on {{some parts of the}} surface valves and spools potentially exposed to aggressive reservoir fluids.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{professor}} Dreyfus, {{along with}} three other famous European surgeons specialized in mitral valve repair, developed the <b>Master</b> of <b>Valve</b> Repair, a training course supported by Edwards Lifesciences, happening twice or thrice a year, where more than 2000 European surgeons {{have been trained to}} advanced techniques in mitral valve repair.|$|R
50|$|Some {{trees have}} a second swab valve, the two {{arranged}} {{one on top of}} the other. The intention is to allow rigging down equipment from the top of the tree with the well flowing while still preserving the Two-barrier rule. With only a single swab valve, the upper <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> is usually closed to act as the second barrier, forcing the well to be shut in for a day during rig down operations. However, avoiding delaying production for a day is usually too small a gain to be worth the extra expense of having a Christmas tree with a second swab valve.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if {{a section}} of pipe from a {{production}} line leading from a [...] Christmas tree to the process plant, were to need replacement, {{this area of the}} piping would need isolation before the offending section was removed or oil would be able to flow freely out of the piping into the environment, causing environmental damage, a health and safety hazard and waste of a precious resource. Under the two barrier rule, there must be two separate isolations between the oil flowing from the well to this area of the piping. The logical barriers in this case would be the production wing valve and the upper <b>master</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system (e.g., suspension strut or steering ram) are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|E
50|$|For an {{oil and gas}} {{separator}} {{to accomplish}} its primary functions, pressure must be maintained in the separator so that the liquid and gas can be discharged into their respective processing or gathering systems. Pressure is maintained on the separator by use of a gas backpressure valve on each separator or with one <b>master</b> backpressure <b>valve</b> that controls the pressure on a battery {{of two or more}} separators. The optimum pressure to maintain on a separator is the pressure that will result in the highest economic yield from the sale of the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.|$|R
5000|$|Rear Admiral S. E. W. Kittelle, Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, {{subsequently}} cited Lt. Cmdr. Calhoun's {{display of}} leadership and personality that saved [...] "three-quarters of {{the crew of the}} Young" [...] and Lt. Herzinger for his [...] "coolness and great assistance in the face of grave danger." [...] Also commended by the admiral was Fireman First Class J. T. Scott, who attempted to close off the <b>master</b> oil <b>valve</b> to prevent a boiler explosion, volunteering to go below to the fireroom and go below the floor plates. The water, rapidly rising through the gashes in the ship's hull, however, prevented Scott from completing the task. He survived.|$|R

His more current, collaborative projects are with Sound Designer & <b>master</b> EVI (electronic <b>valve</b> instrument) player Judd Miller, including their ambient group bFas (Blood from a Stone).|$|R
5000|$|In May 1965 five infill wells were sabotaged. The {{incident}} {{occurred during the}} reign of King Idris before the 1969 coup led by Colonel Qaddafi. The wild wells were not reported in the news media and the perpetrations not revealed. Until the Persian Gulf War of 1991 this was the largest simultaneous well fire ever. In recognition of the number and ferocity of the blowouts BP called for the fire fighter Red Adair plus his lieutenants Boots & Coots. On arrival the crew drove around the field to assess the task.

40|$|Ballast barge for {{underwater}} structure {{consists of}} a reinforced concrete structure partitioned into watertight compartments. The barge structure includes a 3 -way venting valve, a compressed air manifold, a <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> for connecting the manifold to an air line, and an open port in each compartment for admitting and expelling sea water...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Flow Control {{is closely}} related to Air Traffic Control. Air Traffic Control is the {{business}} of the Federal Aviation Administration. To formulate an understanding of advanced flow control and its use as a management tool in the National Airspace System, it becomes necessary to speak somewhat of air traffic control, the role of FAA, and their relationship to advanced flow control. Also, this should dispell forever, any notion that advanced flow control is the inspirational <b>master</b> <b>valve</b> scheme to be used on the Alaskan Oil Pipeline...|$|E
5000|$|Anderson's career took off, however, in 1944, when {{he joined}} Duke Ellington's {{orchestra}} at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia. He quickly became {{a central part of}} Ellington's sound. Anderson was capable of playing in a number of jazz styles, but is best remembered as a high-note trumpeter. He had a big sound in all registers, but could play in the extreme high register (up to triple C) with great power (he was able to perform his high-note solos without a microphone, while other members of a big band were usually amplified for their solos). Wynton Marsalis called him [...] "one of the best" [...] high-note trumpeters. More than just a high-note trumpeter, though, Anderson was also a <b>master</b> of half <b>valve</b> and plunger mute playing. He played with Ellington's band from 1944 to 1947, from 1950 to 1959, and from 1961 to 1971, with each break corresponding to a failure to lead his own big band.|$|R
40|$|Trains brakes are {{pneumatically}} actuated and use {{the same}} pneumatic line for power and signal transmission. This simple architecture presents limits for long trains since the last vehicles brakes receive a very delayed command and the train speed must be limited. Solutions were proposed using a signal transmission line parallel to the pneumatic line. These systems, though effective, present drawbacks and are of difficult implementation as retrofits. A solution is described, which leaves the braking system unchanged, but reduces the time delay in the signal transmission by adding a pneumotronic unit at the pneumatic line end. This unit analyzes the pressure time history, recognizes the precursors of new braking commands and issues inputs to a valve at the pneumatic line end mirroring the commands to the <b>master</b> <b>valve.</b> The rapidity of the braking action is enhanced, thereby allowing a more uniform braking and a speed increase of long freight trains...|$|E
30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first <b>master</b> <b>valve,</b> which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|E
