An ordinary bathtub can be filled with 3 to 4 in of hot water (about 110 F), and sat in for 15-20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the water cools down. Alternatively, a large basin can be used, and there are specially built devices that fit into toilet bowls.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{the noodles}} can be drained and dry roasted. This {{gets rid of}} the bitterness. It also makes the noodles have a more pasta-like consistency. Dry {{roasting}} is done by placing noodles in a non-stick skillet on high for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> you hear a slight squeaking noise when moving them around.

50|$|Matta rice is {{traditionally}} double cooked. The rice is washed {{in a large}} pan and left to soak from 1 hour to overnight. The rice is drained and simmered with 4 to 8 parts water for 30 minutes. It is then covered and left for 15-20 minutes. The rice is then salted and boiled for another 15-20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> cooked. It is finally drained and left covered for a further 10-15 minutes before serving.|$|R
50|$|The dish is {{traditionally}} prepared by first frying chicken drumsticks or thighs.

50|$|Pocket dialing (also {{known as}} pocket calling or butt dialing) {{refers to the}} {{accidental}} placement of a phone call while a person's mobile phone or cordless phone is in the owner's pocket or handbag. The recipient of the call typically hears random background noise when answering the phone. If the caller remains unaware, the recipient will sometimes overhear whatever {{is happening in the}} caller's vicinity. A pocket-dialed call can continue for many <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the recipient's voice mail system ends the call.|$|R
50|$|If {{the female}} is {{receptive}} then she will run {{in front of}} the male a few steps then freeze her body. The female when then exhibit lordosis behavior. In response, the male will typically groom the female hamster's rear, then mount the female. Mating lasts several seconds. After mating, the male may groom himself or the female. Then he will mount the female again. The mating pair should be left to repeat this for 20-30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> one of the hamsters loses interest.|$|R

5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one <b>minute,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|R
50|$|Quetschentaart, {{a popular}} Luxembourg speciality, {{is an open}} fruit tart with zwetschgen or damson plums. Traditionally, it is a {{seasonal}} dish served in the autumn after the local plums have ripened in September. The dough for the pastry base consists of flour, yeast, milk, and butter. It is kneaded and allowed to rise for half an hour. The base is then basted with egg, sprinkled with sugar, placed in a baking dish, and covered with halved plums (no stones) arranged in circles. It is baked at 180 C for some 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> ready.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the student teams used for larger and longer group projects, in-class groups are often ephemeral, lasting {{for only a few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the end of the period. Because of this, little effort is put into forming these groups, usually letting the students self-select their teams. This paper argues that greater student interaction and learning can take place by using instructor-selected teams. Two group formation techniques for in-class group work, the latent jigsaw method and grouping students by Felder-Silverman learning styles, are presented. Observations from a classroom deployment of these techniques are also described...|$|R
40|$|Sometime between 30 {{seconds and}} 2 minutes after {{delivery}} {{appears to be}} the best interval. In term infants, delayed clamping (waiting 1 <b>or</b> 2 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the cord stops pulsating) improves hemoglobin and ferritin levels, but slightly increases the risk of neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A, meta-analysis). In preterm infants less than 37 weeks of age, cord clamping between 30 and 120 seconds after delivery reduces the need for blood transfusion (number needed to treat [NNT]= 4) and frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage (NNT= 8) compared with clamping in less than 20 seconds (SOR: A, meta-analyses) ...|$|R
50|$|The advised {{method of}} cooking, by boiling, yields an {{impressive}} output from the ingredients. Generally, the hot cereal {{is made with}} a 4:1 water to cereal ratio, which can be adjusted to personal consistency preferences (for example, using 3:1 to later add milk to taste). To make 4 servings combine 4 cups of water, 1 cup of Red River Cereal and 1/4 t. salt (optional). Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and boil gently for approximately 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> desired consistency, stirring occasionally. Cover, {{remove from heat and}} let stand for a few minutes.|$|R
50|$|The pumpkin is peeled, cubed {{and boiled}} in water. When cubes are tender enough the {{preparation}} is pureed with {{a blender or}} smashed in its own cooking liquid in the same pot, then sugar is added, and finally corn flour is sifted all over the bland puree in the pot while stirring the mixture in the fire, keep stirring for about 10 <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the corn flour is completely cooked. Fresh cheese finely chopped is added, stir again {{for a few seconds}} and retrieve the pot from the fire. Kiveve used to be cooked in clay pots.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down on a baking sheet. It is then baked for 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are made}} from grated sweet potatoes, grated coconut, sugar, flour, coconut milk, and/or water,raisins, ginger, grated nutmeg, salt and essence or vanilla extract. The mixture is {{combined}} in a bowl until it thickly coats {{the back of a}} spoon. The cooking method is quite simple, but what is often debated is the wrapping. The mixture can be cooked wrapped in foil where others prefer to cook it wrapped in coccoloba leaves, banana leaves, [...] or seaside grape leaves. Either way the wrapped contents must be boiled in salted water for about 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the mixture in the wrapping is firm.|$|R
50|$|Pre-soak the sago in {{the water}} for 15 minutes. Melt {{the butter in a}} deep saucepan. Add the {{vermicelli}} and toss it in the butter with a fork until the vermicelli is lightly browned. Add the cardamom, cinnamon and the sultanas and stir. Pour in the milk and bring to the boil. Add the sago and simmer for 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> sago is transparent, stirring constantly to prevent sticking of the ingredients to the saucepan. Add the rose water, sugar and almonds and continue to simmer until well blended for 10 minutes. Serve hot. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Preparation time: 1 hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{person who}} is taking the test steps {{up and down on}} a {{platform}} in a cycle of one step per two seconds. The platform is at a height of about 50 cm or 20 inches. The rate of 30 steps per minute must be held up for five <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> exhaustion. To ensure the right speed, a metronome is used. Exhaustion is {{the point at which the}} subject cannot maintain the stepping rate for 15 seconds. The subject immediately sits down on completion of the test, and the heartbeats are counted for 1 to 1.5, 2 to 2.5, and 3 to 3.5 minutes.|$|R
2500|$|A {{panellist}} scores {{one point}} {{for making a}} correct challenge against whoever is speaking, or the speaker gets a point if the challenge is deemed incorrect. If a witty interjection amuses the audience, but is not a correct challenge, at the chairman's discretion the challenger can nevertheless be awarded an extra point (the [...] "bonus point" [...] rule). A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject {{for the remainder of}} the <b>minute,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> he <b>or</b> she is successfully challenged. The person speaking when the whistle blows after 60 seconds also scores a point. An extra point is awarded if a panellist speaks for the entire minute without being challenged.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} time the herbs are left in the liquid depends on the purpose for which the {{infusion}} is being prepared. Usually steeping for not more than 15 to 30 <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the mix cools, will create a beverage with optimal flavor. Steeping for a longer time typically results in a somewhat bitter-tasting infusion. Four (4) hours, however, is a more appropriate length of time for achieving herbal potency if health benefits are the priority. Quantities of the herb and liquid used will {{vary according to the}} herb or how strong the infusion is required to be. A common proportion used is 28 g (one ounce) of herb to 0.5 L (one pint) of liquid.|$|R
