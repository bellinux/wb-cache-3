The data used in this study was collecty by interviewing fruit producers in the County of Aracti, Limoeiro do Norte e Quixeré. All the counties, after 1998 (the year of implantation of the Program) had improvement in technology use and increase in productivity. In most of the cases, an important benefit was the generation of local job opportunities. It is suggested that the Government should provide incentives in the form of credit, technical assistance and provide <b>marketing</b> <b>guarantee</b> and improved substructure to attract agricultural industries for better use of fruits in the states.

Staff are then scheduled in the manner that satisfies the <b>marketing</b> <b>guarantee</b> to the surgeons, satisfies labor contracts, and minimizes staffing costs. We assessed weekday nurse anesthesia group staffing at nine such suites to determine whether statistical methods can identify staffing solutions whereby all the cases are covered but for which staffing costs are less than those obtained using the staffing plans implemented by anesthesia groups ’ managers. Two years of operating room information system case duration and staffing data were analyzed.

In addition, labor contracts specify that hourly staff are paid to work a minimum number of hours each day (e. g., 8 h). Staff are then scheduled in the manner that satisfies the “marketing guarantee ” to the surgeons, satisfies the labor contracts, and minimizes staffing costs. To do this, cases are scheduled in each operating room (OR) without planned delays between cases (1), and overtime is essentially mandatory (2).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{examined}} socio economic characteristics of contracted turkey farms in Turkey. Results reeval that young labor force and literacy rate were at sufficient level. Although main production activity on farms was contracted turkey breeding, plant production, plant production, cattle, {{sheep and goats}} breeding were other activities carried out. While 83. 98 % of farm land under farm property, 16. 02 % of that was used as rented and shared land. Grain production had the highest share in plant production. The number of turkeys, large and small animals was, respectively 4845, 3. 38 and 0. 32 heads in average farm. Tractors were present on 40. 82 % of farms. While the share of variable cost in production cost, respectively, belong to heating (16. 51 %), lightening(15. 87 %) and pad(12. 11 %) cost. On the other hand, the highest shares in fixed cost, respectively, belong to poultry-house depreciationi (10. 17 %), poultry-house interest(10. 17 %) and parmanent labor expenses(6. 81 %). Gross production value, gross income, and net income were, respectively, found as 6428. 35 $/year, 3083. 18 /year and 1293. 91 $/year. Duration of contracted turkey breeding of farms was on average 2. 63 periods. The most important factors causing to run a contracted turkey firm was price and sale guarantee.

But the theoretical examination of information markets has lagged relative to their implementation and use. This paper proposes a simple theoretical model of information markets to understand their information dynamics. We investigate and provide initial answers to a series of research questions that are important to understanding how information markets work, which are: (1) Does an information market converge to a consensus equilibrium? (2) If yes, how fast is the convergence process? (3) What is the best possible equilibrium of an information market? and (4) Is an information <b>market</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to converge to the best possible equilibrium...|$|R

Through the contributions of the Austrian economists, that underlined the mutations that occur after the inflationary processes in the allocation of resources, revenue distribution and in the evolution of entrepreneurial activities, we understand the necessity to use a healthy currency. The conclusions of the study reflect the undisputed virtues of the gold standard whose stabilizing mechanisms can only function on a free <b>market,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by economic freedom and without the state’s intervention...|$|R

A procedure {{which can be used}} to compare the economic value of contracts is also presented. Extensive commercial production of sunflowers is relatively recent. Contracts provide growers with an assured <b>market,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> price, and assistance in proper growing practices. Processors and marketing agencies can better control quality and supply through contracts. The proportion of sunflower growers under contract has been declining as farmers become more familiar with the crop, because of expanding market outlets, and because several contractors wish to avoid costs of contracting. Sunflowers are contracted directly with contractors or through their agent country elevators. Contracts generally specify acreage, price, quality, delivery, and payment provisions. Provisions of 17 contracts are summarized and a method of selecting the most profitable contract is explained. Marketing, Production Economics,...|$|R

40|$|Many {{variable}} annuities provide money-back <b>guarantees</b> and <b>market</b> <b>guarantees</b> on invested principal. Embedded in some {{of these}} guarantees are stochastic maturity put options with adjustable strike prices. These variable annuities can be surrendered or lapsed at any time. The lapse option when exercised rationally represents an American style sell-back option that is exercised by the policyholder when the embedded put option is out-of-the-money. The death benefits we consider are only exercised involuntary, that is, upon the death of the policyholder. Critical to the valuation analysis is that the embedded put options have stochastic maturity and that the policyholder can exercise the lapse, or early-exercise, option feature to increase the value of the contract and thereby exposing the insurance company to loss of fees. We analyze specific variable annuity products by focusing on the lapse option when exercised either rationally or irrationally, taking into account the mortality risk and surrender charges...|$|R
