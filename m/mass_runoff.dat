The purpose of this research was to determine the environmental impacts from the land application of effluent from lagoons used to treat caged laying hen manure. Informed decisions can be made about the safe and practical rates of effluent application when the environmental impacts are known. Eighteen small plots were installed at the Texas A&M University Farm near College Station, TX (clay soil) and near Overton, TX (loamy soil) where 912 mm and 1, 058 mm were received over the study period, respectively. Surface water runoff was collected in steel containers buried flush with the ground at the down slope end of the plots. The plots were installed in existing Coastal bermudagrass fields. TAM 90 ryegrass was overseeded in half of the plots in the fall. Poultry lagoon effluent was applied at 0, 538, and 1076 kg total N/ha/yr. Total N, P, K, Ca, Mc,, and Na concentrations were examined in the vegetation. Electrical conductivity, pH, extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, and N 03 -concentrations were examined in the soil. Electrical conductivity, pH, total N, P, K, Ca, Mc,, and Na concentrations were examined in the surface runoff. An analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test with an alpha of 0. 1 were used to statistically evaluate the data. Increasing effluent application significantly increased the yield of vegetation between 70 % and 300 %. Nitrocren concentrations in the vegetation increased. Total uptake of the other nutrients increased proportionally to the increase in yield. Soil nitrate and potassium concentrations increased with increased effluent application. At the Overton site, nitrate and potassium penetrated down to at least 914 mm. An application of 538 kg N/ha/yr had little impact on the environmental factors examined when compared to 0 kg N/ha/yr. Application of 1076 kg N/ha/yr had little statistical effect on dry matter yield, but electrical conductivity, N 03 - concentrations, and K concentrations increased in the soil. In the surface water runoff, electrical conductivity increased and the total <b>mass</b> <b>runoff</b> of P and K increased...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{potential}} {{presence of}} steroid hormones in runoff from sites where biosolids {{have been used}} as agricultural fertilizers is an environmental concern. A study was conducted to assess the potential for runoff of seventeen different hormones and two sterols, including androgens, estrogens, and progestogens from agricultural test plots. The field containing the test plots had been applied with biosolids for the first time immediately prior to this study. Target compounds were isolated by solid-phase extraction (water samples) and pressurized solvent extraction (solid samples), derivatized, and analyzed by gas chromatography− tandem <b>mass</b> spectrometry. <b>Runoff</b> samples collected prior to biosolids application had low concentrations of two hormones (estrone < 0. 8 to 2. 23 ng L− 1 and androstenedione < 0. 8 to 1. 54 ng L− 1) and cholesterol (22. 5 ± 3. 8 μg L− 1). In contrast, significantly higher concentrations of multiple estrogens (< 0. 8 to 25. 0 ng L− 1), androgens (< 2 to 216 ng L− 1), and progesterone (< 8 to 98. 9 ng L− 1) were observed in runoff samples taken 1, 8, and 35 days after biosolids application. A significant positive correlation was observed between antecedent rainfall amount and hormone <b>mass</b> loads (<b>runoff).</b> Hormones in runoff were primarily present in the dissolved phase (< 0. 7 -μm GF filter), and, to a lesser extent bound to the suspended-particle phase. Overall, these results indicate that rainfall can mobilize hormones from biosolids-amended agricultural fields, directly to surface waters or redistributed to terrestrial sites away from the point of application via runoff. Although concentrations decrease over time, 35 days is insufficient for complete degradation of hormones in soil at this site...|$|R

Stormwater was grab sampled and the flow rate was measured during 52 storm events. The dimensionless cumulative pollutant <b>mass</b> and <b>runoff</b> volume {{were used to determine}} the runoff volume needed to transport 50 and 80 % of total pollutant mass. Almost all the constituents did not satisfy this first flush definition except for total suspended solids (TSS) in the commercial catchment. The averages first runoff volume required to remove 50 and 80 % of the total pollutant mass were 37 and 67, 35 and 65, and 36 and 64 % for the residential, commercial and industrial catchments, respectively. It seemed that less runoff is required to transport the same amount of pollutant loadings in tropical urban catchments than in temperate regions. BOD, COD, NH 3 -N, SRP and TP consistently showed strong first flush effects in all catchments. The first flush strengths of TSS, BOD, COD, NH 3 -N and TP in the commercial catchment were strongly correlated with total rainfall, rainfall duration, max 5 min intensity, runoff volume and peak flow, but not with antecedent dry days.

40|$|Excessive {{phosphorus}} (P) in runoff {{contributes to}} eutrophication {{of fresh water}} bodies. Studies have shown that manure and effluent applied from animal feeding operations to waste application fields (WAFs) have contributed to excess P in segments of the North Bosque River in east central Texas. There is a growing need for environmentally sound, economically viable, and easy to establish best management practices to control such pollution. Vegetative buffer strips offer a potential solution for reducing runoff P from WAFs by extracting it from soil and by reducing sediment P delivery (due to reduced runoff and soil erosion) to streams. In a field study, ten plots (5 m x 5 m) were assigned to five replicated treatments, namely control (bare, without having any plant cover), cool season grass, warm season forb, warm season grass, and warm season legume to assess their efficacy of runoff sediment control and P sequestration potential from soil. These plots were established on a coastal Bermuda grass WAF that received dairy lagoon effluent. A runoff collection system, a 1 m x 1 m sub-plot with a runoff conveyance and collection apparatus, was installed on the upstream and downstream margins of each plot. Natural rainfall runoff samples were collected and analyzed subsequently for total P, soluble P, and total suspended solids in the laboratory. Additionally, the total <b>mass</b> of <b>runoff</b> collected from each sub-plot was calculated. Results suggested that the warm season forb and warm season grass were the most effective vegetative covers for the reduction of runoff P, followed by coastal Bermuda and cool season grass, respectively. The lesser amount of runoff total P in these two treatments was due to lesser <b>runoff</b> <b>mass</b> and lesser sediments in the runoff due to initial interception of rain and less raindrop impact on soil because of denser vegetative cover in both treatments compared to all other treatments...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{order to}} assess the impact of future climate {{scenarios}} on water availabil-ity in glaciated basins, we are implementing a combined field observation and distributed mass balance modeling approach. Accurate estimation of water stored within the snow and ice cover of these basins requires knowledge of the distributed snow and ice mass balance throughout the year. In this study, we are estimating the annual <b>mass</b> balance and <b>runoff</b> for Haut Glacier d′Arolla from 2000 – 2006. Haut Glacier d′Arolla is a small, temperate val-ley glacier in southwestern Switzerland. Our estimations are based on observed elevation changes from three digital elevation models (DEM′s), derived from aerial photographs in September 1999, 2005 and October 2006. An energy balance model, driven by meteorolog-ical variables from automatic weather stations (AWS) inside the catchment area, is run for the period 2005 – 2006. The model results are validated with direct <b>mass</b> balance and <b>runoff</b> measurements. From combined mass balance measurements, energy balance calculations and recorded runoff, we are estimating the contribution from icemelt to the runoff for this period to be around 25 %, the contribution from snow around 60 % and the contribution from rain 15 %. It is therefore important for water resources management to understand the distribu-tion of snow in an alpine catchment, as it seems to be the not only the controlling factor for the shape of the hydrograph, and therefore also for the availability of water throughout the season, but also for the total availability of water...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{pesticides}} by homeowners or pest-control operators in urban settings is common, yet contributions of washoff from these materials are not easily understood. In the present study, cypermethrin, formulated as Cynoff EC (emulsifiable concentrate) and Cynoff WP (wettable powder) insecticides, was applied at typical rates to 10 different building material surfaces to examine its washoff potential from each surface. Using an indoor rainfall simulator, a 1 -h rainfall event was generated andwashoff samples were collected from 3 replicates of each surface type. Washoff was analyzed for cypermethrin using gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. An analysis of variance for a split-plot design was performed. Many building materials had similar water <b>runoff</b> <b>masses,</b> but asphalt resulted in significantly reduced average water <b>runoff</b> <b>masses</b> (73 % less). The Cynoff WP formulation generally produced greater cypermethrin washoff than the Cynoff EC formulation. In addition, results for both the WP and EC formulations indicated that smoother surfaces such as vinyl and aluminum siding had higher washoff (1. 0 – 14. 1 % mean percentage of applied mass). Cypermethrin washoff from rough absorptive surfaces like concrete and stucco was lower and ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 3 % and from 0 to 0. 2 %, respectively, mean percentage of applied mass.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{carried out}} into the values of lag time for catchment areas as measured from centre of mass of excess rainfall to centre of <b>mass</b> of resulting <b>runoff.</b> Since any variation of this value for an individual catchment {{is an indication of}} non-linear response, this study is closely associated with non-linearity of catchment systems. Values of lag were measured for a range of floods on five separate catchment areas and were correlated with a number of factors. The difference in value between catchments was found to be a function of the catchment characteristics, while variations in the value for an individual catchment were strongly related to the magnitude of the floods. As the degree of variation was fairly constant for the areas studiesd, the degree of non-linearity was also considered to differ little between the catchments. Three general formulae have been developed for estimating the lag time of natural catchments: suggestions made regarding their use and estimates of their probable accuracy. Development of the formulae required a detailed analysis of a large volume of hydrological data. An objective systematic procedure was developed to deal with this problem and to carry out the initial correlation studies. For this purpose, lag was measured to the centre of <b>mass</b> of direct <b>runoff,</b> and a novel measure of flood magnitude was devised, viz. weighted mean discharge.

The present review evaluated the current status of the research on seagrasses and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitats off the coast of Brazil in terms of plant responses to environmental conditions, changes in distribution and abundance, and the possible role of climate change and variability. Despite {{an increase in the number}} of studies, the communication of the results is still relatively limited and is mainly addressed to a national or regional public; thus, South American seagrasses are rarely included or cited in global reviews and models. The scarcity of large-scale and long-term studies allowing the detection of changes in the structure, abundance and composition of seagrass habitats and associated species still hinders the investigation of such communities with respect to the potential effects of climate change. Seagrass meadows and SAV occur all along the Brazilian coast, with species distribution and abundance being strongly influenced by regional oceanography, coastal water <b>masses,</b> river <b>runoff</b> and coastal geomorphology. Based on these geomorphological, hydrological and ecological features, we characterised the distribution of seagrass habitats and abundances within the major coastal compartments. The current conservation status of Brazilian seagrasses and SAV is critical. The unsustainable exploitation and occupation of coastal areas and the multifold anthropogenic footprints left during the last 100 years led to the loss and degradation of shoreline habitats potentially suitable for seagrass occupation. Knowledge of the prevailing patterns and processes governing seagrass structure and functioning along the Brazilian coast is necessary for the global discussion on climate change.

The first flush effect is typically occurring in urban runoff from hard surfaces and is not observed when the source of pollutants is unlimited (e. g. soil particles).

Mountain glaciers are critical in supplying freshwater to populations inhabiting the valleys downstream who heavily rely on glacier runoff, such as arid and semi-arid regions of western China. Owing to recent climate warming and the consequent rapid retreat of many glaciers, it is essential to evaluate the long-term change in glacier melt water production, especially when considering the glacier area change. This paper describes the structure, principles and parameters of a modified monthly degree-day model considering glacier area variation. Water balances in different elevation bands are calculated with full consideration of the monthly precipitation gradient and air temperature lapse rate. The degree-day factors for ice and snow are tuned by comparing simulated variables to observation data for the same period, such as mass balance, equilibrium line altitude and glacier runoff depth. The glacier area-volume scaling factor is calibrated with the observed glacier area change monitored by remote sensing data of seven sub-basins of the Tarim interior basin. Based on meteorological data, the glacier area, <b>mass</b> balance and <b>runoff</b> are estimated. The model can be used to evaluate the long-term changes of melt water in all glacierized basins of western China, especially for those with limited observation data. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{major concern}} {{motivating}} research in acid rain materials effects {{has been the}} potential for damage to cultural heritage, particularly outdoor marble and bronze sculpture. However, a combination of field and laboratory studies has failed to show a correlation between rain pH and loss of materials. In order to understand this counterintuitive lack of acid rain effect, an aqueous geochemical modeling approach was used to analyze rain runoff chemistry for {{the relative importance of}} acid rain neutralization, dry deposition, {{and in the case of}} marble, natural carbonate dissolution. This approach involved the development of pH – SO 42 − phase diagrams for marble (calcium carbonate) and bronze (copper) under ambient environmental conditions. This then enabled reaction path modeling of the acid neutralization process using the pH range typically found in wet deposition (3. 5 – 6). The results were for marble that the theoretical maximum amount of Ca 2 + ion that could be lost due acid rain neutralization would be 0. 158  mmol/l compared to 10. 5  mmol/l by dry deposition, and for bronze, the Cu 2 + ion losses would be 0. 21  mmol/l and 47. 3  mmol/l respectively. Consequently dry deposition effects on these materials have the potential to dominate over wet deposition effects. To test these predictions the geochemical models were applied to examples of data sets from <b>mass</b> balance (<b>runoff</b> vs rainfall) studies on a marble statue in New York City and some bronze memorial plaques at Gettysburg PA. Although these data sets were collected in the early 1980 s they remain valid for demonstrating the mass balance method. For the marble statue, the mean Ca 2 + losses by dry deposition was about 69 % of the total compared 0. 3 % for acid rain neutralization, which was less than the natural carbonate dissolution losses of 0. 8 %. For the bronze, the mean Cu 2 + losses were 70. 6 % by SO 42 − dry deposition and 23 % by NO 3 − dry deposition compared to 6. 4 % by acid rain neutralization. Thus for both cases the wet deposition component was less than the variability of the dry deposition components, which explains the observed lack of correlation between the rain pH and the material losses. In addition, for the marble case, there was evidence for HCl acid vapor attack resulting from nitric acid/sea salt interactions and for bronze, ammonium ion may be important. In both cases, significant imbalances suggested that unmeasured organic acids may have a significant effect...|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{data from}} six on-ice weather stations, {{calibrated}} MODIS-derived albedo and proglacial river gauging measurements {{to drive and}} validate an energy balance model. We aim to quantify the record-setting positive temperature anomaly in 2010 {{and its effect on}} <b>mass</b> balance and <b>runoff</b> from the Kangerlussuaq sector of the Greenland ice sheet. In 2010, the average temperature was 4. 9 ?C (2. 7 standard deviations) above the 1974 ? 2010 average in Kangerlussuaq. High temperatures were also observed over the ice sheet, with the magnitude of the positive anomaly increasing with altitude, particularly in August. Simultaneously, surface albedo was anomalously low in 2010, predominantly in the upper ablation zone. The low albedo was caused by high ablation, which in turn profited from high temperatures and low winter snowfall. Surface energy balance calculations show that the largest melt excess (? 170 %) occurred in the upper ablation zone (above 1000 m), where higher temperatures and lower albedo contributed equally to the melt anomaly. At lower elevations the melt excess can be attributed to high atmospheric temperatures alone. In total, we calculate that 6. 6 ? 1. 0 km 3 of surface meltwater ran off the ice sheet in the Kangerlussuaq catchment in 2010, exceeding the reference year 2009 (based on atmospheric temperature measurements) by ? 150 %. During future warm episodes we can expect a melt response of at least the same magnitude, unless a larger wintertime snow accumulation delays and moderates the melt-albedo feedback. Due to the hypsometry of the ice sheet, yielding an increasing surface area with elevation, meltwater runoff will be further amplified by increases in melt forcings such as atmospheric heat. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The dense {{highland}} field {{area in the}} upstream {{region of}} the Lake Soyang watershed is subject to excessive soil erosion during the wet season. In this study, stormwater runoff from the Lake Soyang watershed was monitored during four rainfall events at 10 locations throughout 2016. The maximum SS concentration at Naedongcheon, which {{is located in the}} upper part of the Soyang River, reached 4598 mg/L. The event mean concentration (EMC) of SS loads in Naedongcheon ranged from 82. 2 mg/L to 926. 3 mg/L. We found that, although the first flush events were usually concentrated in highly paved urban areas, a first flush occurred in the agricultural area of the dense highland field region. The first flush phenomenon was identified by a dimensionless cumulative <b>runoff</b> <b>mass</b> and volume curve (M(V) curve), and the intensity of the first flush was analyzed by the coefficient of the nonlinear regression model and the FF 30 and FF 25 values (the fraction of pollution load transported by the first 30 % and 25 % of runoff, respectively). Nonlinear regression models using the power function were applied to fit the M(V) curve, the FF 30 values were inversely proportional to the coefficient a of the regression model. A long-term seasonal trend decomposition for monthly turbidity and precipitation was performed for the Lake Soyang. Long-term turbidity trend was approximately coincident with the trend in long-term precipitation. In addition, the present status of the best management practices (BMPs) in {{the upper part of the}} Soyang River basin was investigated, and a survey of the management and operation of the BMPs was conducted for selected farmers...|$|R
40|$|River flow is a {{reflection}} of the input of moisture and its transformation in storage and transmission over the catchment. In the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), since high altitude climate measurement and observations of glacier mass balance are weak or absent, analysis of trends in magnitude and timing in river flow provides a window on trends and fluctuations in climate and glacier outflow. Trend analysis is carried out using a Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test on records extending from 1960 to 1998. High level glacial catchments show a falling trend in runoff magnitude and a declining proportion of glacial contribution to the main stem of the Indus. Elsewhere annual flow has predominantly increased with several stations exhibiting statistically significant positive trends. Analysis of timing using spring onset date (SOT) and centre of volume date (CoV) indicated no clear trends – in direct contrast to what has been observed in Western North America. There is, however, a consistent relationship between CoV and annual runoff volume. A consistently positive correlation was also found between SOT and CoV for all the stations implying that initial snowpack conditions before the onset of runoff influence timing throughout the season. The results of the analysis presented here indicate that the magnitude and timing of streamflow hydrograph is influenced both by the initial snowpack and by seasonally varied trends in temperature. The study contributes to the understanding of the links between climate trends and variability and river <b>runoff</b> and glacier <b>mass</b> balance and <b>runoff.</b> The Upper Indus Basin is predominantly influenced by winter precipitation; similar trend analysis applied to summer monsoon dominated catchments of the Central Himalaya is recommended...|$|R
