50|$|The OPM {{technology}} {{is based on}} the cognitive networking principles that are advanced from traditional wireless networking by the opportunistic utilization of both spectrum bandwidth and mesh station/radio availability. Traditional wireless networking assumes that those resources can be predetermined, and the protocol stacks from wire-line networks can be re-used. For example, in the traditional stack, the MAC (<b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control)</b> <b>layer</b> allocates spectrum resources to wireless links; and the network layer sets up a network routing path from source to destination based on the overall network topology. In large-scale wireless systems, the use of this stack results in a network that is unable to respond to volatile spectrum availability which can be typical in unlicensed bands where interference prevails. In addition, random station/radio availability is also often encountered due to the dynamic traffic load (congestion) and other factors such as radio failure. Bottlenecks along both wireless links and stations are created because the packet forwarding protocol cannot respond quickly to these changes.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to detection accuracy, computational complexity {{is also an}} important evaluation indicator. The reason is that, in order not to interfere the PUs, CR users should detect the their presence with a high probability and vacate the channels or reduce transmit power within a certain amount of time. In other words, the time window for detection should be small enough. In each window with fixed duration, the first part is used for performing spectrum sensing and the rest is reserved for transmitting data. During the sensing interval, all CR users keep quiet as enforced by protocols, e.g., at the <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>layer.</b> Therefore, an efficient detection algorithm can benefit the improvement of throughput.|$|E

We use formal inductive reasoning to establish these requirements. In order to ensure that the bridges behave correctly regardless of the topology of the surrounding bridges and LANs, the Rebeca modular verification techniques are applied. These techniques are shown to be efficiently applicable in model checking of open systems...|$|E
