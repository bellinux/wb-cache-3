40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increment}} on micro-components for medical purposes, diseases treatment and surgical equipment, requiring biocompatible materials such as some engineering polymers. Nonetheless, the micro size of these parts impose challenges for fabrication using high production processes, like polymer injection moulding submitted to high cooling rates and variability of the process, in addition to the complex design of precise mould micro-cavities. This paper presents the development of a complete mould for a polymer locking ligation system fabrication, a medical device selected as a case study for <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> tooling. This development includes the prediction of appropriate injection parameters and process conditions using computer simulations and a comparison with real values of pressure and temperature during the process, due to data acquisition with piezoelectric sensors. The results show a moderate error between experimental and simulated results, in terms of pressure (0. 05 % prediction error) and average cycle temperature at the sensor location (13 % prediction error), which proves that the proposed approach can be used for precision <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> applications...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for micro-products and micro-components in many industry sectors therefore development of advanced manufacturing technologies and metrological instrumentation in this range, have thus become a critical issue and an engineering challenge. If a product cannot be measured, although it might be manufactured, {{it would not be}} possible to analyse its design in order to improve its functionality. Electroforming could be defined as the highly specialized use of electrodeposition for the manufacturing of metal parts. Due to progress in materials, processes and equipment, electroforming has shown considerable development. Consequently, electroforming is increasingly combined with other micro-manufacturing technologies, giving rise to other processes such as LIGA and UV-LIGA. Thanks to the accumulated experience of Fabricación Integrada y Avanzada research group, of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the electroforming process focused on macro-scale, as well as specific equipment available, this paper aims to analyse the potential of electroforming process for <b>micro-injection</b> <b>mould</b> manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is progressively assuming {{an important}} role in metrology applications and great efforts are being made in order {{to turn it into a}} reliable and standardized measuring technology. CT is typically used for non-destructive tests, but it is currently becoming very popular for dimensional metrology applications due to its strategic advantages such as the capability of performing measurements on both the component’s surface and volume, allowing inspection possibilities to otherwise non-accessible internal features. This paper focuses on the dimensional verification of two <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulded</b> components, selected from actual industrial productions, using CT metrological tools. For this purpose, several parts have been measured with two different CT machines, and the results have been compared with the measurements obtained by other measuring systems.

40|$|PhD. (Applied Chemistry) This {{dissertation}} presents work involving novel fabrication {{conditions of}} polylactide (PLA) based microcantilevers (μCs) {{as well as}} the characterisation of the fabricated cantilever beams. Focused ion beam (FIB) milling and <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> were chosen as the fabrication processes during this research. Unfortunately, FIB milling was a time-consuming fabrication technique and could not maintain the shape of the sample. <b>Micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> (μIM) was chosen as the main fabrication process of μCs because it is a commercially used technique and can produce many cantilevers per cycle. Before the fabrication of the actual cantilevers, deflection comparison of the two types of cantilevers (Si & polymer) was made using structural mechanics application mode of MEMS module of COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulations showed that polymer μC deflects more than Si μC because of its low Young’s modulus. Another modelling and simulation was made based on the Eigen frequencies of PLA and Si cantilevers with various geometries. The predictions of the modelled cantilever beams depicted that resonance frequency depends on the mechanical properties of the material as well dimensions of the beams. For μIM, a shim-stock mould can be used to produce μCs from a modified PLA extrusion grade...|$|E
40|$|<b>Micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} for micro-manufacture because of its mass-production capability and relatively low component cost. The aspect ratios achievable in replicating micro features are one of the most important process characteristics and constitute a major manufacturing constraint in applying injection moulding in a range of micro-engineering applications. This research studies the effects of five process and one size factors on the achievable aspect ratios, and the role they play in producing micro components in different polymer materials. In particular, the following factors are considered: barrel temperature, mould temperature, injection speed, holding pressure, the existence of air evacuation and the sizes of micro features. The study revealed that the barrel temperature and the injection speed are the key factors affecting the aspect ratios of micro features replicated in PP and ABS. In case of POM, in addition to these two factors, the mould temperature is also an important factor for improving the replication capabilities of the <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process. For all three materials, an increase of feature sizes improves the melt flow. However, the melt fill of micro features does not increase linearly with the increase of their sizes...|$|E

Many prototypes covering {{a wide range of}} applications have been fabricated and tested, especially in the fields of chemical and biomedical sciences. Nevertheless, integrated microfluidic devices are still far from being widely used as cost-efficient commercial products, often because they are produced by fabrication methods that are not suitable for mass production. Several methods have been recently introduced for cost-efficient high-volume production of micro-featured plastic parts, such as <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> and hot-embossing. These methods have been widely used for fabricating simple disposable microfluidic chips on a commercial scale, but have not yet been similarly applied for producing integrated microfluidic devices. This review paper aims at presenting {{the state of the art}} in integrated microfluidic devices produced by cost-efficient high-volume replication processes. It takes <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> and hot-embossing as its two process examples. Several types of elements are classified according to their functions, defined relative to their physical inputs and outputs. Their level of integration is reviewed.

40|$|In {{recent years}} plastic {{moulding}} techniques, such as injection moulding, {{have been developed}} to fulfil the needs of micro-components fabrication. <b>Micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> (SLIM) is the process which enables the mass production of polymer micro-systems such as micro-mechanical parts, micro-fluidic systems, micro-optics, micro-components for medical devices, etc. A key factor in micro-polymer based systems is the possibility of designing and therefore replicating very complex geometries, allowing an increasing number of applications and micro-products. Complex geometries bring challenges during the filling stage of the process. Many features cause melt front separation: through holes, presence of pins and cores, changes of thickness, multi-gating systems, existence of micro-inserts, two component injection moulding, etc. When two or more melt flows join each other after separation, a layer between the two original flows will generate and a weld line is formed {{on the surface of the}} micro-moulded part. This phenomenon has to be avoided or at least reduced, since in the weld line area the mechanical properties are poorer than in the bulk part, creating strength problems on the final part. Although weld lines are unavoidable, the <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process can indeed be optimized in order to on one hand obtain a good filling of the cavity and on the other hand decrease the size of the weld lines. In this paper, an investigation devoted to the determination of the influence of typical injection moulding parameters on the weld lines' dimensions is presented, using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Depth and width of weld lines were chosen as parameters to be optimized...|$|E

A design-of-experiments approach was used to investigate the effect of five processing parameters on both criteria. It was found that holding pressure, melt temperature and injection velocity were statistically significant for part mass, whereas injection velocity alone was significant for mass variation. Desirability functions were used to predict processing conditions that improved both requirements within pre-set conditions. The technique was validated by experiment and it was shown to be applicable for process parameters for multiple criteria...|$|E

Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a promising technique for the final shaping of the mould and for creation of the injection cavity with required precision, since ECM is independent of material hardness and ductility [1]. The latter property is important concerning SLM produced moulds, which are often harder and stronger than cast moulds. In this study, electrochemical machining of two SLM materials, AlSi 10 Mg Aluminium alloy and 18 Ni- 300 Nickel-based maraging tool steel, is analysed. A unique process applying a continuous electrolytic free jet (Jet-ECM) is used that offers the possibility to generate micro-structures by controlling the nozzle movement and the current flow...|$|E

The same mould with microstructured cavities produced by high-speed milling or indentation was used for both replication methods. The replication process parameters are analyzed in both cases, and the resulting polymeric shapes and surface states are characterized in using 3 D scanning mechanical microscopy. It is shown that both replication processes give accurate results if the processing cycle as well as pressure and temperature are well adapted. This provides a comparative study between both processes and the validity domain of each one...|$|E

To achieve sufficient tool life, functional tool materials like hardened steel or cemented carbide are used. The mechanical properties of these materials are a limitation to the variety of structuring technologies which can be applied. Due to their non-contact thermal material removal mechanism electrical discharge machining technologies offer a suitable alternative, in terms of obtainable structure dimensions and accuracy.

The process chain implemented micro-milling for fabricating micro-structured tool inserts, and mu IM and micro-overmoulding was used for replication. A two-plate mould was used for moulding the substrate, whilst a three-plate mould with a replaceable insert was used for TPE overmoulding. The presented application was an interconnect system for a microfluidic device, which enabled direct fitting of standard tubes into microfluidic substrates.

Special attention is paid to the melt flow sensitivity when filling microchannels, particularly the factors affecting the shear rate, pressure, and temperature. In particular, the simulation model was used to investigate the flow behaviour of two polymer materials, polypropylene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, by varying the process parameters. Then, the results of this investigation were compared with those reported in an experimental study. Conclusions are made about the accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed simulation model...|$|E

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of runner dimensions on quality of moulded parts. Solidworks plastic simulation software was used for mould cavity filling analysis of ASTM D 638 - 10 Type V. The dimensions of the runner and the injection point investigated are 0. 5 mm, 0. 8 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm. The moulded part quality characteristics predicted are filling time, sink mark and air trap.

Five processing parameters are investigated using a screening half- factorial experimentation plan to determine their possible effect on the filling quality of the moulded parts. The part mass is used as an output parameter to reflect the filling of the parts. The experiments showed that the holding pressure is the most significant processing parameter for all the different shapes. In addition, the experiments showed that the geometry of the parts plays a role in determining the significant processing parameters. For a more complex part, injection speed and mould temperature became statistically significant.

40|$|The {{presence}} or absence of residual stresses is a major concern in the injection moulding of plastic products used in precision optical and medical applications. Micro-lens arrays are critical components of LED displays that are produced by <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Due to their small size, residual stresses in these micro-lens arrays are difficult to measure and characterize. The birefringence method was used in this paper to evaluate residual stresses in injection-moulded micro-lens arrays and the finite element simulation method was also employed to predict their distribution. Comparable results from both experiments and simulation were obtained. It is found that the mould temperature is the most significant processing parameter. The value of maximum residual stress is smaller when the mould temperature is higher. The birefringence method is applicable and efficient for the measurement of residual stress in injection-moulded plastic micro-optics. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

Airline stabilized ZnO nanoparticles were obtained by the decomposition of diethylzinc (Et 2 Zn) {{in the presence of}} amines. If butylamine is used as the ligand, NMR and XPS measurements show that complete removal of butylamine can be achieved by storing the nanoparticles in vacuum overnight. Ligand removal leads to electronic interparticle contact as measured with field effect transistors. The ability to process at room temperature makes this approach highly interesting for temperature-sensitive substrates.

This research investigates the effects of three processing and one geometric factor on the surface quality of micro-features in three different polymer materials. In particular, the following factors are considered: barrel temperature, mould temperature, injection speed and distance between micro-features. In this investigation, the mould temperature was set in the conventional range. The study revealed that in general, increasing the barrel temperature, mould temperature and the injection speed improves the polymer melt fill in micro-cavities. However, the effects of these factors on the process replication capabilities are not consistent for different polymer materials, and could be adverse in specific conditions.

The moulding surface {{quality in the}} moulds is important and determines the manufacturing specifications for a given micro-engineering component. In this study, melting and vaporisation removal technologies were analysed: laser beam machining (LBM) as the material removal technique and electron beam machining (EBM) as the finishing process. Stainless steel DIN X 42 Cr 13 was used for machining 10 × 10 mm 2 flat surfaces. LBM parameters, namely intensity, frequency, cutting depth, scanning speed and hatching, and EBM conditions, as energy density, number of irradiation and frequency, were varied. The surface topography and integrity and the micro-structure were characterised by optical and electronic microscopy, roughness profilometry, X-ray spectroscopy and micro- and ultrahardness tests.

This paper presents a methodology to assess and minimise process variability in <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> an example of well- established mass-production techniques for micro-components. A design-of- experiments approach was implemented, where five process parameters were investigated for possible effects on the process variability of two components.

Applications of this technology are, amongst others, microfluidic components for lab-on-a-chip devices and micro-optical components. In both cases, the control of the part flatness is a key aspect to maintaining the component's functionality. The objective of this work is to determine the factors affecting the flatness of a polymer part manufactured by µ-IM and to control the manufacturing process with the aim of minimizing the in-process part deformation. As a case study, a PMMA microfluidic substrate with overall dimensions of 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness was investigated by designing a µ-IM experiment having flatness as the experimental response. The part flatness was measured using a micro-coordinate measuring machine. Finite elements analysis was also carried out to study the optimal ejection pin configuration.

It integrates two different technologies, namely laser ablation and focused ion beam (FIB) milling for micro-structuring and sub-micron patterning, respectively, thus to fabricate inserts incorporating different length scale functional features. Two alternative laser sources, namely nano-second (NS) and pico-second (PS) lasers, were considered as potential candidates for the first step in this master-making process chain. The capabilities of the component technologies together with some issues associated with their integration were studied. To validate the replication performance of the produced masters, a Zr-based BMG insert was used to produce a small batch of micro-fluidic devices by <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Furthermore, an experimental study was also carried out to determine whether it would be possible by NS laser ablation to structure the Zr-based BMG workpieces with a high surface integrity whilst retaining the BMG’s non-crystalline morphology.

40|$|Rheological {{characterization}} of ethylcellulose (EC) -based melts {{intended for the}} production, via <b>micro-injection</b> <b>moulding</b> (μIM), of oral capsular devices for prolonged release was carried out. Neat EC, plasticized EC and plasticized EC containing solid particles of a release modifier (filler volume content in the melt around 30 %) were examined by capillary and rotational rheometry tests. Two release modifiers, differing in both chemical nature and particle geometry, were investigated. When studied by capillary rheometry, neat EC appeared at process temperatures as a highly viscous melt with a shear-thinning characteristic that progressively diminished as the apparent shear rate increased. Thus, EC as such could not successfully be processed via μIM. Plasticization, which induces changes in the material microstructure, enhanced the shear-thinning characteristic of the melt and reduced considerably its elastic properties. Marked wall slip effects were noticed in the capillary flow of the plasticized EC-based melts, with or without release modifier particles. The presence of these particles brought about an increase in viscosity, clearly highlighted by the dynamic experiments at the rotational rheometer. However, it did not impair the material processability.

40|$|Existing and {{emerging}} micro-engineered products tend to integrate {{a multitude of}} functionalities into single enclosures/packages. Such functions generally require different length scale features. In practice, devices having complex topographies, which incorporate different length scale features cannot be produced by employing a single fabrication technology but by innovatively, integrating several different complementary manufacturing techniques {{in the form of}} a process chain. In order to design novel process chains that enable such function and length scale integration into miniaturised devices, it is required to utilise materials that are compatible with the various component manufacturing processes in such chains. At the same time, these materials should be able to satisfy the functional requirements of the produced devices. One family of materials, which can potentially fulfil these criteria, is bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). In particular, the absence of grain boundaries in BMGs makes them mechanically and chemically homogeneous for processing at all length scales down to a few nanometres. In this context, this research presents an experimental study to validate a novel process chain.

In order to produce high-quality injection moulded micro-parts, a crucial aspect to be fully understood and optimised is the filling of the cavity by the molten polymer. As a result, {{the relationships between the}} filling pattern and the different process parameter settings have to be established. In this paper, a novel approach based on the use of weld lines as flow markers to trace the development of the flow front during the filling is proposed. The effects on the filling stage of process parameters such as temperature of the melt, temperature of the mould, injection speed and packing pressure have been investigated. An optical coordinate measuring machine has been employed for the investigation. The micro-cavity, which presents micro-features ranging from 600 mu m down to 150 mu m, has been manufactured by micro-electrodischarge machining. A commercially available polystyrene grade polymer has been moulded using a high-speed injection moulding machine. The design of experiment technique was employed to determine the effect of the process parameters on the filling phase of the micro-cavity. In addition, extensive measuring uncertainty analysis was performed to validate the experimental plan. Results show that the temperature of the mould and the injection speed are the most influencing process parameters during the injection moulding of a micro-component...|$|E
