50|$|With the glucose {{phosphotransferase}} system, the phosphorylation {{status of}} EIIA can have regulatory functions. For example, at low glucose concentrations phosphorylated EIIA accumulates and this activates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels rise and this then activates CAP (catabolite activator protein), which {{is involved in}} the catabolite repression system, also known as glucose effect. When the glucose concentration is high, EIIA is mostly dephosphorylated and this allows it to inhibit adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, lactose permease, and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> Thus, as well as the PEP group translocation system being an efficient way to import substrates into the bacterium, it also links this transport to regulation of other relevant proteins.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of glucose to maltose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells causes a rapid and irreversible {{loss of the}} ability to transport maltose, resulting both from the repression of transcription of the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> gene and from the inactivation of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> The latter is referred to as glucose-induced inactivation or catabolite inactivation. We describe an analysis of this process in a maltose-fermenting strain expressing a hemagglutinin (HA) -tagged allele of MAL 61, encoding <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> The transfer of maltose-induced cells expressing the Mal 61 /HA protein to rich medium containing glucose produces a decrease in maltose transport rates which is paralleled by a decrease in Mal 61 /HA <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> protein levels. In nitrogen starvation medium, glucose produces a biphasic inactivation, i. e., an initial, rapid loss in transport activity (inhibition) followed by a slower decrease in transport activity, which correlates with a decrease in the amount of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> protein (proteolysis). The inactivation in both rich and nitrogen-starved media results from a decrease in Vmax with no apparent change in Km. Using strains carrying mutations in END 3, REN 1 (VPS 2), PEP 4, and PRE 1 PRE 2, we demonstrate that the proteolysis of Mal 61 /HAp is dependent on endocytosis and vacuolar proteolysis and is independent of the proteosome. Moreover, we show that the Mal 61 /HA <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> is present in differentially phosphorylated forms...|$|E
40|$|Strain {{selection}} and {{improvement in the}} baker’s yeast industry have aimed {{to increase the speed}} of maltose fermentation in order to increase the leavening activity of industrial baking yeast. We identified two groups of baker’s strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be distinguished by the mode of regulation of maltose utilization. One group (nonlagging strains), characterized by rapid maltose fermentation, had at least 12 -fold more maltase and 130 -fold-higher <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> activities than maltose-lagging strains in the absence of inducing sugar (maltose) and repressing sugar (glucose). Increasing the noninduced maltase activity of a lagging strain 13 -fold led to an increase in CO 2 production in unsugared dough. This increase in CO 2 production also was seen when the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> activity was increased 55 -fold. Only when maltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> activities were increased in concert was CO 2 production by a lagging strain similar to that of a nonlagging strain. The noninduced activities of maltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> constitute the largest determinant of whether a strain displays a nonlagging or a lagging phenotype and are dependent upon the MALx 3 allele. Previous strategies for strain improvement have targeted glucose derepression of maltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> expression.

40|$|An Escherichia coli strain which overproduces the lactose {{permease}} {{was used}} to investigate the mechanism of allosteric regulation of this permease and those specific for melibiose, glycerol, and maltose by the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Thio-β-digalactoside, a high affinity substrate of the lactose permease, released the glycerol and <b>maltose</b> <b>permeases</b> from inhibition by methyl-α-d-glucoside. Resumption of glycerol uptake occurred immediately upon addition of the galactoside. The effect was not observed in a strain which lacked or contained normal levels of the lactose permease, but growth of wild-type E. coli {{in the presence of}} isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside plus cyclic AMP resulted in enhanced synthesis of the lactose permease so that galactosides relieved inhibition of glycerol uptake. Thiodigalactoside also relieved the inhibition of glycerol uptake caused by the presence of other PTS substrates such as fructose, mannitol, glucose, 2 -deoxyglucose, and 5 -thioglucose. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by methyl-α-glucoside was also relieved by thiodigalactoside in E. coli T 52 RT provided that the lactose permease protein was induced to high levels. Cooperative binding of sugar and enzyme IIIGlc to the melibiose permease in Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated, but no cooperativity was noted with the glycerol and <b>maltose</b> <b>permeases.</b> These results are consistent with a mechanism of PTS-mediated regulation of the lactose and melibiose permeases involving a fixed number of allosteric regulatory proteins (enzyme IIIGlc) which may be titrated by the increased number of substrate-activated permease proteins. This work suggests that the cooperativity in the binding of sugar substrate and enzyme IIIGlc to the permease, demonstrated previously in in vitro experiments, has mechanistic significance in vivo. It substantiates the conclusion that PTS-mediated regulation of non-PTS permease activities involves direct allosteric interaction between the permeases and enzyme IIIGlc, the postulated regulatory protein of the PTS...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} phosphotransferase system (PTS) {{functions in}} a variety of regulatory capacities. One of the best characterized of these is the process by which the PTS regulates inducer uptake and catabolite repression. Early genetic and physiological evidence supported a mechanism whereby the phosphorylation state of an enzyme of the PTS, the enzyme III specific for glucose (IIIGlc), allosterically inhibits the activities of a number of permeases and catabolic enzymes, the lactose, galactose, melibiose, and <b>maltose</b> <b>permeases,</b> as well as glycerol kinase. Extensive biochemical evidence now supports this model. Evidence is also available showing that substrate binding to those target proteins enhances their affinities for IIIGlc. In the case of the lactose permease, this positively cooperative interaction represents a well documented example of transmembrane signaling, demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Although the PTS-mediated regulation of cyclic AMP synthesis (catabolite repression) is not as well defined from a mechanistic standpoint, a model involving allosteric activation of adenylate cyclase by phospho-IIIGlc, together with the evidence supporting it, is presented. These regulatory mechanisms may prove to be operative in gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, but the former organisms may have introduced variations on the theme by covalently attaching IIIGlc-like moieties to some of the target permeases and catabolic enzymes. It appears likely that the general process of PTS-catalyzed protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation will prove to be important to the regulation of numerous bacterial physiological processes, including chemotaxis, intermediary metabolism, gene transcription, and virulence...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of maltose induces MAL gene expression in Saccharomyces cells, but {{little is known}} about how maltose is sensed. Strains with all <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> genes deleted are unable to induce MAL gene expression. In this study, we examined the role of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> in maltose sensing by substituting a heterologous transporter for the native <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> PmSUC 2 encodes a sucrose transporter from the dicot plant Plantago major that exhibits no significant sequence homology to <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PmSUC 2 is capable of transporting maltose, albeit at a reduced rate. We showed that introduction of PmSUC 2 restores maltose-inducible MAL gene expression to a maltose permease-null mutant and that this induction requires the MAL activator. These data indicate that intracellular maltose is sufficient to induce MAL gene expression independently of the mechanism of maltose transport. By using strains expressing defective mal 61 mutant alleles, we demonstrated a correlation between the rate of maltose transport and the level of the induction, which is particularly evident in medium containing very limiting concentrations of maltose. Moreover, our results indicate that a rather low concentration of intracellular maltose is needed to trigger MAL gene expression. We also showed that constitutive overexpression of either MAL 61 <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> or PmSUC 2 suppresses the noninducible phenotype of a defective mal 13 MAL-activator allele, suggesting that this suppression is solely a function of maltose transport activity and is not specific to the sequence of the permease.

Yeast strains deleted for SWD 1, SWD 3, SDC 1, SET 1, BRE 2, or SPP 1, encoding components of the COMPASS complex, fermented a medium containing 22 % maltose with noticeably higher attenuation than did the wild type, resulting in production of up to 29 % more ethanol. The least effective strain was spp 1. Absence of COMPASS components had no effect on the fermentation of media with 20 % glucose, 20 % sucrose, or 16 % maltose. Deletion of SWD 3 resulted in larger amounts of MAL 12 transcript, encoding maltase, at the late stages of fermentation of 22 % maltose. A similar effect on maltase activity and maltose uptake capability was seen. The lysine 4 residue of histone H 3 was trimethylated in wild-type cells at the late stages, while only small amounts of the dimethylated form were detected. Trimethylation and dimethylation of this residue were not detected in strains deleted for SWD 1, SWD 3, SET 1, BRE 2, or SDC 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Overflow {{metabolism}} is an undesirable {{characteristic of}} aerobic cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during biomass-directed processes. It results from elevated sugar consumption rates that cause a high substrate conversion to ethanol and other bi-products, severely affecting cell physiology, bioprocess performance, and biomass yields. Fed-batch culture, where sucrose consumption rates {{are controlled by}} the external addition of sugar aiming at its low concentrations in the fermentor, is the classical bioprocessing alternative to prevent sugar fermentation by yeasts. However, fed-batch fermentations present drawbacks that could be overcome by simpler batch cultures at relatively high (e. g. 20 g/L) initial sugar concentrations. In this study, a S. cerevisiae strain lacking invertase activity was engineered to transport sucrose into the cells through a low-affinity and low-capacity sucrose-H + symport activity, and the growth kinetics and biomass yields on sucrose analyzed using simple batch cultures. Results We have deleted from the genome of a S. cerevisiae strain lacking invertase the high-affinity sucrose-H + symporter encoded by the AGT 1 gene. This strain could still grow efficiently on sucrose due to a low-affinity and low-capacity sucrose-H + symport activity mediated by the MALx 1 <b>maltose</b> <b>permeases,</b> and its further intracellular hydrolysis by cytoplasmic maltases. Although sucrose consumption by this engineered yeast strain was slower than with the parental yeast strain, the cells grew efficiently on sucrose due to an increased respiration of the carbon source. Consequently, this engineered yeast strain produced less ethanol and 1. 5 to 2 times more biomass when cultivated in simple batch mode using 20 g/L sucrose as the carbon source. Conclusion Higher cell densities during batch cultures on 20 g/L sucrose were achieved by using a S. cerevisiae strain engineered in the sucrose uptake system. Such result was accomplished by effectively reducing sucrose uptake by the yeast cells, avoiding overflow metabolism, with the concomitant reduction in ethanol production. The use of this modified yeast strain in simpler batch culture mode can be a viable option to more complicated traditional sucrose-limited fed-batch cultures for biomass-directed processes of S. cerevisiae. </p...|$|R

In addition to these dominant MAL loci, several naturally occurring, partially functional alleles of MAL 1 and MAL 3 have been identified.

40|$|Saccharomyces yeasts ferment several alpha-glucosides {{including}} maltose, maltotriose, turanose, alpha-methylglucoside, and melezitose. In {{the utilization}} of these sugars transport is the rate-limiting step. Several groups of investigators have described {{the characteristics of the}} <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> (D. E. Kroon and V. V. Koningsberger, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 204 : 590 - 609, 1970; R. Serrano, Eur. J. Biochem. 80 : 97 - 102, 1977). However, Saccharomyces contains multiple alpha-glucoside transport systems, and these studies have never been performed on a genetically defined strain shown to have only a single permease gene. In this study we isolated maltose-negative mutants in a MAL 6 strain and, using a high-resolution mapping technique, we showed that one class of these mutants, the group A mutants, mapped to the MAL 61 gene (a member of the MAL 6 gene complex). An insertion into the N-terminal-coding region of MAL 61 resulted in the constitutive production of MAL 61 mRNA and rendered the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> similarly constitutive. Transformation by high-copy-number plasmids containing the MAL 61 gene also led to an increase in the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> A deletion-disruption of MAL 61 completely abolished maltose transport activity. Taken together, these results prove that this strain has only a single <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> and that this permease is the product of the MAL 61 gene. This permease is able to transport maltose and turanose but cannot transport maltotriose, alpha-methylglucoside, or melezitose.

The amino acid sequence of the oppD protein has been determined and this protein is shown to share extensive homology with the hisP and malK proteins. Three lines of evidence lead us to propose the existence of a nucleotide-binding site on each of these proteins. A consensus nucleotide-binding sequence can be identified in the same relative position {{in each of the three}} proteins. The oppD protein binds to a Cibacron Blue affinity column and can be eluted by ATP but not by CTP or NADH. The oppD protein is labelled specifically by the nucleotide affinity analogue 5 '-p-fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine. The identification of a nucleotide-binding site provides strong evidence that transport by periplasmic binding protein-dependent systems is energized directly by the hydrolysis of ATP or a closely related nucleotide.

Rgt 2 p, which along with Snf 3 p monitors extracellular glucose levels, appears to be the glucose sensor for the glucose-transport-independent pathway.

Induction of the MAL 61 and MAL 62 gene products requires {{the presence of}} maltose and the MAL 63 gene. Mutations within the MAL 63 gene produce nonfermenting strains unable to induce the two structural gene products. Reversion of these mal 63 nonfermenters to maltose fermenters nearly always leads to the constitutive expression of maltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> and constitutivity is always linked to MAL 6. We demonstrated that for one such revertant, strain C 2, constitutivity did not require the MAL 63 gene, since deletion disruption of this gene did not affect the constitutive expression of the structural genes. In addition, constitutivity was trans acting. Deletion disruption of the MAL 6 -linked structural genes for maltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> in this strain did not affect the constitutive expression of a second, unlinked maltase structural gene. We isolated new maltose-fermenting revertants of a nonfermenting strain which carried a deletion disruption of the MAL 63 gene. All 16 revertants isolated expressed maltase constitutively. In one revertant studied in detail, strain R 10, constitutive expression was demonstrated to be linked to MAL 6, semidominant, trans acting, and residing outside the MAL 63 -MAL 61 -MAL 62 genes. From these studies we propose the existence of a second trans-acting regulatory gene at the MAL 6 locus. We call this new gene MAL 64.

Our results indicate that glucose inhibition is also Mig 2 p independent. Moreover, we show that neither overexpression of the MAL-activator nor elimination of inducer exclusion is sufficient to relieve glucose inhibition, suggesting that glucose acts to inhibit induction by affecting maltose sensing and/or signaling. The glucose inhibition pathway requires HXK 2, REG 1, and GSF 1 and appears to overlap upstream with the glucose repression pathway. The likely target of glucose inhibition is Snf 1 protein kinase.

Further genetic analysis demonstrates that RGR 1 and SIN 4 work in a common pathway and each component of the Mediator Sin 4 module plays a distinct role in regulating MAL gene expression.

Two glucose sensing and signaling pathways stimulate glucose-induced inactivation of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease.</b> Pathway 1 uses Rgt 2 p as a sensor of extracellular glucose and causes degradation of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> protein. Pathway 2 is dependent on glucose transport and stimulates degradation of permease protein and very rapid inactivation of maltose transport activity, more rapid than {{can be explained by}} loss of protein alone. In this report, we characterize signal generation through pathway 2 using the rapid inactivation of maltose transport activity as an assay of signaling activity. We find that pathway 2 is dependent on HXK 2 {{and to a lesser extent}} HXK 1. The correlation between pathway 2 signaling and glucose repression suggests that these pathways share common upstream components. We demonstrate that glucose transport via galactose permease is able to stimulate pathway 2. Moreover, rapid transport and fermentation of a number of fermentable sugars (including galactose and maltose, not just glucose) are sufficient to generate a pathway 2 signal. These results indicate that pathway 2 responds to a high rate of sugar fermentation and monitors an intracellular metabolic signal. Production of this signal is not specific to glucose, glucose catabolism, glucose transport by the Hxt transporters, or glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase 1 or 2.

Since λ receptors and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> are inducible by maltose and absent in malT mutants, {{it is likely that}} the expression of the malK lamB operon is controlled by the product of gene malT, the positive regulatory gene of the maltose system...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic {{adenosine}} 3 ′, 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) stimulates maltodextrin phosphorylase synthesis in Escherichia coli cells induced with maltose. A maximal effect {{occurs at}} 2 to 3 mM cyclic AMP. The action of cyclic AMP is specific, inasmuch as adenosine triphosphate, 3 ′-AMP, 5 ′-AMP, adenosine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP are inactive. Glucose, α-methyl glucoside, 2 -deoxyglucose, and pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate repress maltodextrin phosphorylase synthesis. This repression is reversed by cyclic AMP. The action of cyclic AMP {{appears to be}} at the transcriptional level, since cyclic AMP fails to stimulate phosphorylase production in induced cells in which messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis has been arrested by rifampin or by inducer removal. The two other enzymes involved in the metabolism of maltose, amylomaltase and <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> are also induced in this strain of E. coli and affected by glucose and cyclic AMP {{in a manner similar to}} phosphorylase...|$|E
40|$|Maltose {{fermentation}} in Saccharomyces species {{requires the}} presence {{of at least one}} of five unlinked MAL loci: MAL 1, MAL 2, MAL 3, MAL 4, and MAL 6. Each of these loci consists of a complex of genes involved in maltose metabolism; the complex includes maltase, a <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> and an activator of these genes. At the MAL 6 locus, the activator is encoded by the MAL 63 gene. While the MAL 6 locus {{has been the subject of}} numerous studies, the binding sites of the MAL 63 activator have not been determined. In this study, we used Escherichia coli extracts containing the MAL 63 protein to define the binding sites of the MAL 63 protein in the divergently transcribed MAL 61 - 62 promotor. When a DNA fragment containing these sites was placed upstream of a CYC 1 -lacZ gene, maltose induced beta-galactosidase. These sites therefore constitute an upstream activating sequence for the MAL genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of the maltase (MALS) and the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> (MALT) genes in Saccharomyces species is coregulated at the transcriptional level; they are coordinately induced by maltose {{in the presence of}} a positively acting regulatory (MALR) gene and carbon catabolite repressed by glucose. We generated a series of deletions in the upstream region of the MAL 6 S gene to examine the regulatory elements in detail. The results showed that inducible expression by maltose was lost when the region between 320 and 380 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation codon was deleted. This region contained an imperfect inverted repeat sequence (- 361 to - 327) or four copies of short direct repeats that might serve as components of the upstream activation site (UASM) for the maltase gene, or both. When a stretch of T-rich sequence (- 253 to - 237) was deleted, the susceptibility of the maltase gene to carbon catabolite repression was affected...|$|E
40|$|Maltose {{utilization}} {{and regulation}} in aspergilli {{is of great}} importance for cellular physiology and industrial fermentation processes. In Aspergillus oryzae, maltose utilization requires a functional MAL locus, each composed of three genes: MALR encoding a regulatory protein, MALT encoding <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> and MALS encoding maltase. Through a comparative genome and transcriptome analysis we show that the MAL regulon system is active in A. oryzae {{while it is not}} present in Aspergillus niger. In order to utilize maltose, A. niger requires a different regulatory system that involves the AmyR regulator for glucoamylase (glaA) induction. Analysis of reporter metabolites and subnetworks illustrate the major route of maltose transport and metabolism in A. oryzae. This demonstrates that overall metabolic responses of A. oryzae occur in terms of genes, enzymes, and metabolites when altering the carbon source. Although the amount of knowledge on maltose transport and metabolism is far from being complete in Aspergillus spp., our study not only helps to understand the sugar preference in industrial fermentation processes, but also indicates how maltose affects gene expression and overall metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The MAL 61 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> {{a protein}} {{required}} for the transport of maltose across the plasma membrane. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the cloned MAL 61 gene. A single 1842 bp open reading frame is present within this region encoding the 614 residue putative MAL 61 protein. Hydropathy analysis suggests that the secondary structure consists of two blocks of six transmembrane domains separated by an approximately 71 residue intracellular region. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of 100 and 67 residues in length, respectively, also appear to be intracellular. Significant sequence and structural homology is seen between the MAL 61 protein and the Saccharomyces high-affinity glucose transporter encoded by the SNF 3 gene, the Kluyveromyces lactis lactose permease encoded by the LAC 12 gene, the human HepG 2 glucose transporter and the Escherichia coli xylose and arabinose transporters encoded by the xylE and araE genes, indicating that all {{are members of a}} family of sugar transporters and are related either functionally or evolutionarily. A mechanism for glucose-induced inactivation of maltose transport activity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The MAL {{gene family}} of Saccharomyces {{consists}} of five multigene complexes (MAL 1, MAL 2, MAL 3, MAL 4 and MAL 6) {{each of which}} encodes <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> (GENE 1), maltase (GENE 2) and the trans-acting MAL-activator (GENE 3). Four of these loci have been mapped and each is located {{at or near the}} telomere of a different chromosome. We compare the physical structure of the MAL loci and their flanking sequences. The MAL loci were shown to be both structurally and functionally homologous throughout an approximately 9. 0 -kb region. The orientation of the MAL loci was determined to be: CENTROMERE [...] . GENE 3 -GENE 1 -GENE 2 [...] . TELOMERE. Telomere-adjacent sequences were found flanking GENE 2 of the MAL 1, MAL 3 and MAL 6 loci. No common repeated elements were found on the centromere-proximal side of all of the MAL loci. These results suggest that, during the evolution of this polygenic family, the MAL loci translocated to different chromosomes via a mechanism that involved the rearrangement(s) of chromosome termini...|$|E
40|$|The MIG 1 gene was {{disrupted}} in a haploid {{laboratory strain}} (B 224) {{and in an}} industrial polyploid strain (DGI 342) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The alleviation of glucose repression of the expression of MAL genes and alleviation of glucose control of maltose metabolism were investigated in batch cultivations on glucose-maltose mixtures. In the MIG 1 -disrupted haploid strain, glucose repression was partly alleviated; i. e., maltose metabolism was initiated at higher glucose concentrations than in the corresponding wild-type strain. In contrast, the polyploid delta mig 1 strain exhibited an even more stringent glucose control of maltose metabolism than the corresponding wild-type strain, which {{could be explained by}} a more rigid catabolite inactivation of <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> affecting the uptake of maltose. Growth on the glucose-sucrose mixture showed that the polypoid delta mig 1 strain was relieved of glucose repression of the SUC genes. The disruption of MIG 1 was shown to bring about pleiotropic effects, manifested in changes in the pattern of secreted metabolites and in the specific growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{resulting}} in constitutive production of maltase {{have been identified}} {{at each of the}} five MAL loci of Saccharomyces yeasts. Here we examine a dominant constitutive, glucose-repression-insensitive allele of the MAL 4 locus (MAL 4 -C). Our results demonstrate that MAL 4 -C is an alteration in the MAL 43 gene, which encodes the positive regulator of the MAL structural genes, and that its product is trans-acting. The MAL 43 gene from the MAL 4 -C strain was cloned and integrated into a series of nonfermenting strains lacking a functional regulatory gene but carrying copies of the <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> and maltase structural genes. Expression of the maltase structural gene was both constitutive and insensitive to glucose repression in these transformants. The MAL 4 -C allele also results in constitutive expression of the unlinked MAL 12 gene (encoding maltase) in this strain. In addition, the cloned MAL 43 gene was shown to be dominant to the wild-type MAL 63 gene. We also show that most of the glucose repression insensitivity of strains carrying the MAL 4 -C allele results from alteration of MAL 43...|$|E
40|$|The MAL 6 locus {{is one of}} five {{closely related}} unlinked loci, any one of which is {{sufficient}} for fermentation of maltose in Saccharomyces. Previous genetic analysis indicated that this locus is defined by two complementation groups, MALp and MALg. MALp reportedly is a regulatory gene required for inducible synthesis of the two enzymatic functions needed for fermentation: <b>maltose</b> <b>permease</b> and maltase. We have investigated the physical and genetic structure of the MAL 6 locus, which has been isolated on a recombinant DNA plasmid. One subclone of the region, pDF- 1, was found to encode a single transcribed region and to contain the MALp gene. A second subclone, p 1, was shown to contain the MALg function but surprisingly had not one but two maltose-inducible transcripts. Subclones having only one of these transcribed regions lacked MALg activity. The three transcribed regions have been named MAL 61 and MAL 62, which correspond to MALg, and MAL 63, which corresponds to MALp. This clustered arrangement of a regulatory gene adjacent to the sequences it controls has not previously been described in eukaryotes and is reminiscent of bacterial operons except that the messenger RNA molecules are not polycistronic...|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{the gene}} {{functions}} required to ferment the disaccharide maltose are encoded by the MAL loci. Any {{one of five}} highly sequence homologous MAL loci identified in various S. cerevisiae strains (called MAL 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) is sufficient to ferment maltose. Each is a complex of three genes encoding <b>maltose</b> <b>permease,</b> maltase and a transcription activator. This family of loci maps to telomere-linked positions on different chromosomes and most natural strains contain more than one MAL locus. A number of naturally occurring, mutant alleles of MAL 1 and MAL 3 have been characterized which lack {{one or more of}} the gene functions encoded by the fully functional MAL loci. Loss of these gene functions appears to have resulted from mutation and/or rearrangement within the locus. Studies to date concentrated on the standard maltose fermenting strains of S. cerevisiae available from the Berkeley Yeast Stock Center collection. In this report we extend our genetic analysis of the MAL loci to a number of maltose fermenting and nonfermenting natural strains of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. No new MAL loci were discovered but several new mutant alleles of MAL 1 were identified. The evolution of this gene family is discussed...|$|E
