5|$|<b>Misch</b> was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, <b>Misch</b> travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, <b>Misch</b> and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause <b>Misch</b> some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} <b>Misch</b> {{from further}} service; {{he was free}} to leave. <b>Misch</b> and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. <b>Misch</b> then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. <b>Misch</b> told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told <b>Misch</b> of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping <b>Misch,</b> Schädle shot himself. <b>Misch</b> fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. <b>Misch</b> was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. <b>Misch</b> spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.|$|E

5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, <b>Misch</b> {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed <b>Misch</b> to be the bunker telephone operator. <b>Misch</b> handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. <b>Misch</b> was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, <b>Misch</b> learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, his regiment {{was attached to the}} XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS-Hauptsturmführer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because of his ability, although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck <b>Misch,</b> who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a convalescent home. For his actions, <b>Misch</b> was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As <b>Misch</b> was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were not serving on the front lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, <b>Misch</b> {{received}} a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, {{he joined the}} SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of the German Army as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time. Along with eleven others, he was selected for Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). In August 1939, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of SS-Rottenführer.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker. The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, {{can be found at the}} corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus <b>Misch,</b> one of the last people living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus <b>Misch.</b> Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E

She was {{the translator}} of Claude Lévi-Strauss's La pensée sauvage (The Savage Mind), but later disavowed the translation. She {{was the daughter}} of criminologist and psychoanalyst Kate Friedlander (1902–1949), an expert on the subject of juvenile delinquency, and the physician Walter <b>Misch</b> (1889–1943) who, together, wrote Die vegetative Genese der neurotischen Angst und ihre medikamentöse Beseitigung. After the Reichstag fire in 1933, she emigrated from Berlin, Germany to England with her parents and Jewish psychoanalyst, Paula Heimann (1899–1982).|$|E

500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. <b>Misch</b> witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, <b>Misch</b> only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". <b>Misch</b> started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then <b>Misch</b> observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. <b>Misch</b> left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, <b>Misch</b> later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked <b>Misch</b> if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but <b>Misch</b> declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told <b>Misch</b> that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 interview, <b>Misch</b> called Downfall [...] "Americanized" [...] while {{comparing}} {{what happened}} in the film to {{what happened in}} real life. After listening to an 11-minute recording of Hitler in private conversation with Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, <b>Misch</b> opined: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Misch</b> {{was present}} in the bunker complex when Magda Goebbels {{poisoned}} her six children and then committed suicide with her husband Joseph on 1 May 1945. According to <b>Misch,</b> this act by the Goebbels' of murdering their children was most unsettling. Years later he stated that event was the [...] "most dreadful thing" [...] he experienced in the bunker.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{objections}} of the school director, his grandfather took him out of school after eight years as he thought Rochus needed to learn a trade. After several years, <b>Misch</b> moved to Hoyerswerda and became an apprentice with the firm of Schmüller & Model. [...] There he trained as a painter. In 1935, after working as a journeyman painter, <b>Misch</b> attended the Masters' School for Fine Arts in Cologne. After six months, he returned to Hoyerswerda to continue his training. <b>Misch</b> met Gerda, his wife-to-be, in July 1938. They later married on New Year's Eve, 1942. They had a daughter, Brigitta Jacob-Engelken who after the war supported Jewish causes.|$|E
500|$|Fegelein's {{wife was}} {{then in the}} late stages of {{pregnancy}} (the baby was born in early May). Hitler considered releasing him without punishment or assigning him to Mohnke's troops. Junge—an eye-witness to bunker events—stated that Braun pleaded with Hitler to spare her brother-in-law and tried to justify Fegelein's actions. He {{was taken to the}} garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April, and was [...] "shot like a dog". Rochus <b>Misch,</b> who was the last survivor from the Führerbunker, disputed aspects of this account in a 2007 interview with Der Spiegel. According to <b>Misch,</b> Hitler did not order Fegelein's execution, only his demotion. <b>Misch</b> claimed to know the identity of Fegelein's killer, but refused to reveal his name.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the 2004 German film Downfall (Der Untergang) in France, French {{journalist}} Nicolas Bourcier interviewed <b>Misch</b> on multiple occasions during 2005. The resulting biography was published in French as J'étais garde du corps d'Hitler 1940–1945 (I was Hitler's bodyguard 1940–1945) in March 2006, [...] Translations were released in South America, Japan, Spain, Poland, Turkey, and Germany in 2006 and 2007. <b>Misch</b> served as consultant to writer Christopher McQuarrie on the 2008 film Valkyrie, a Hollywood depiction of the 20 July plot.|$|E
500|$|With {{the deaths}} of Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven on 27 February 2007, Armin Lehmann on 10 October 2008, and Siegfried Knappe on 1 December 2008, <b>Misch</b> {{was said to be}} the last {{survivor}} of the Führerbunker. <b>Misch</b> was loyal to Hitler to the end, stating in Nazi apologia, [...] "He was no brute. He was no monster. He was no superman", [...] "...very normal. Not like what is written", and [...] "e was a wonderful boss". Misch's daughter, Brigitta, learned through her maternal grandmother that Gerda was of Jewish descent. However, Gerda never mentioned it and her father refused to acknowledge it. Brigitta became an architect and has supported Jewish causes.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} from captivity in 1953, <b>Misch</b> {{returned}} to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on New Year's Eve 1953 to the house which was [...] from the Führerbunker. At the time, Misch's wife worked as a teacher in Neukölln. <b>Misch</b> struggled for several years with {{what to do with}} his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making of peanut butter for American troops. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that <b>Misch</b> considered leaving his shop. His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. <b>Misch</b> continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985. [...] His memoir in German, Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness), was published in 2008. The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse.|$|E
500|$|Rochus <b>Misch</b> {{was born}} on 29 July 1917 in Alt-Schalkowitz near Oppeln (Opole) in the Province of Silesia (now Stare Siołkowice, Poland). His father, a {{construction}} worker, died of wounds sustained in World War I. [...] His widowed mother died of pneumonia when he was two and a half, and {{he grew up with}} his grandparents. His older brother Bruno died after a swimming accident in May 1922.|$|E
500|$|Rochus <b>Misch</b> (29 July 1917 – 5 September 2013) was a German Oberscharführer (sergeant) in the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). He {{was badly}} wounded during the Polish {{campaign}} {{during the first}} month of World War II in Europe. After recovering, from 1940 to April 1945, he served in the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK) as a bodyguard, courier, and telephone operator for German dictator Adolf Hitler. He was widely reported in the media as being the last surviving occupant of the Führerbunker when he died in September 2013.|$|E
500|$|Günsche {{left the}} study and {{announced}} that the Führer was dead. The two bodies were carried {{up the stairs to}} ground level and through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were doused with petrol. Eyewitness Rochus <b>Misch</b> reported someone shouting, [...] "Hurry upstairs, they're burning the boss!" [...] After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Bormann lit the papers and threw the torch onto the bodies. As the two corpses caught fire, a small group, including Bormann, Günsche, Linge, Goebbels, Erich Kempka, Peter Högl, Ewald Lindloff, and Hans Reisser, raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus <b>Misch,</b> Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus <b>Misch,</b> who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... I knew if I could keep the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of Hitler's bunker, Rochus <b>Misch,</b> gave this {{account of the}} events to the BBC: ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. <b>Misch</b> tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but {{he knew what was}} going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told <b>Misch</b> that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
50|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} <b>Misch</b> {{from further}} service; {{he was free}} to leave. <b>Misch</b> and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker.
