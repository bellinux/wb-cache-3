5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> {{the motion of the}} filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E

40|$|A new five-phase, surface-inset, permanent-magnet (PM), {{brushless}} dc <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> {{is proposed}} in this paper.

25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} {{transmit power}} to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E

The lens assembly sometimes floated in liquid mercury to reduce friction.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new 8 / 6 -pole split-winding doubly salient {{permanent}} magnet (DSPM) <b>motor</b> <b>drive.</b> The analysis, control, implementation and experiments of the <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> are presented.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of this work is to analyze the brushless DC (BLDC) <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system with input shaping using classical control theory.

40|$|While {{power losses}} and {{efficiency}} of single components of electric <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems were researched extensively, the overall system efficiency has been rarely approached. The wide-spread applications of electric machines make them the largest electrical energy consumers, thus the efficiency of <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems is of fundamental effect on global energy consumption. Analytical efficiency modeling of <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems {{is a very difficult}} task due to complex interactions in a <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system (electrical, mechanical, magnetic, thermal, etc.). In this thesis, a novel method of applying black-box approaches for <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> efficiency modeling is presented. The proposed methodology is flexible and can be applied to any <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system where input and output powers and the control parameter can be measured or accurately estimated. The black-box methods do not model specific physical phenomena governing the system, but simply model the input-output relationship. The black-box modeling approach uses actual physical efficiency measurements of an experimental <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system. Such measurements include all possible interactions within the system, thus making the model comprehensive. Different methods of behavioral comprehensive black-box modeling approaches are presented and their accuracy is evaluated. Models are further benchmarked by assessing their ability to predict the value of the control parameter for maximum-efficiency operating points. One of the behavioral models is implemented on an experimental control platform and used to predict the control parameter for optimal efficiency operation. Finally, the developed models are scrutinized by comparing them to the current analytical knowledge...|$|R
