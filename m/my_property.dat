500|$|It is {{unlawful}} {{to designate}} the Armenian assets as [...] "abandoned goods" [...] for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily {{removed from their}} domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods... Nobody can sell <b>my</b> <b>property</b> if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the Constitution forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither {{the conscience of the}} Ottomans nor the law can allow it.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally mixed reception from critics. The {{day after the}} premiere, Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune wrote that while it was [...] "not the laugh riot The Simpsons have spoiled us to expect – our appetite for showbiz parodies is waning – the episode did have its moments." [...] He further added that he especially liked [...] "the sign posted outside the movie studio gate: 'No Artistic Integrity Beyond This Point.'" [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing that [...] "Gibson actually {{does a good job}} here, and it’s amusing to see Homer’s terrible movie ideas. This isn’t classic Simpsons, but it starts the season on a pretty good note." [...] However, an article in Salon magazine from 2000 points to [...] "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] as the greatest precursor to that Homer would be more predominant as “Jerkass Homer” in the Scully era as showrunner, a Homer who [...] "is not only dumb, but [...] disgusting and semi-sociopathic. This is the Homer who, in the season opener , showed Marge's wedding ring to Mel Gibson and stated, 'This is a symbol that as per our marriage, she's <b>my</b> <b>property</b> and I own her.'" [...] Gibson's performance has generally been praised. Simon Crerar of The Times listed his performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Similarly, Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Gibson's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history in a list of twenty people, calling it [...] "Another ace self-effacing appearance from a Hollywood high-flyer".|$|E

2500|$|Steiner {{received}} {{criticism and}} support for his views that racism was inherent in everyone and that tolerance was only skin deep. He {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "It's very easy to sit here, in this room, and say 'racism is horrible'. But ask me the same thing if a Jamaican family moved next door with six children and they play reggae and rock music all day. Or if an estate agent comes to my house and tells me that because a Jamaican family has moved next door the value of <b>my</b> <b>property</b> has fallen through the floor. Ask me then!" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{a promotional}} event {{for his book}} 5 Days That Shook the World: Seattle and Beyond (2000) Alexander was asked what his {{position}} on the Second Amendment was and responded [...] "... a native Mexican turkey wandered onto <b>my</b> <b>property</b> in Humboldt County, unaware that the California Fish and Game regulations permitted a window of vulnerability for the aforementioned wild turkey. I then proceeded to my 12-gauge and brought that turkey down, thirteen and a half pounds, plucked it, drew it, and ate it, with my loved ones as they say."

2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself. [...] For contrary evidence, others [...] look to Demosthenes' speech [...] "Against Phaenippus", where an exchange of property is explicitly mentioned by the litigant: [...] "For I made this offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender it freely:—I will surrender to him all <b>my</b> <b>property</b> including the mines, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all encumbrances as it was when I first went to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors." [...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
