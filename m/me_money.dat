500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give <b>me</b> <b>money</b> to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

I do appreciate their charity, but I could really do without the condescension. They have been so nice I would hate to break it to them that I really prefer Nietzsche to the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} {{synthetic}} future and conditional have largely disappeared from Brazilian speech. [...] The synthetic future is generally replaced by ir + infinitive (e.g. vou cantar [...] "I will sing"), while the conditional is replaced {{either by the}} imperfect (especially in its modal use; se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava [...] "if you gave <b>me</b> <b>money,</b> I would sing") or by the imperfect of ir + infinitive (in its non-modal, [...] "future of the past" [...] usage; ele disse que ia cantar [...] "he {{said that he would}} sing"). [...] However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. se você for [...] "if you should go"). [...] The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. será/seria [...] "it will/would be" [...] or in the compound tenses terá/teria sido [...] "it will/would have been").|$|E
2500|$|How {{is money}} an abstraction? Money gives the {{illusion}} {{that it has a}} direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making {{the world a better place}} for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that [...] "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give <b>me</b> <b>money,</b> the young man will say, and I will be all right." [...] But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery.|$|E
