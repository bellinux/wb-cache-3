50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the bumps along the ulna represented <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> points or ridges was subsequently examined, and the results presented, at the 2015 meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Elana Cuesta, along {{with two of the}} researchers who initially described Concavenator (Ortega and Sanz), attempted to reconstruct its forearm musculature to determine if the ulnar bumps would be explained as an inter-muscular ridge. They identified the insertion point for the major arm muscles, and determined that the row of bumps could not have been located between any of them. They found that the only possibility was that the bumps could be an attachment scar for the M. anconeus muscle, which is unlikely, because this muscle normally attaches to a smooth surface without marks or bumps on the underlying bone, and argued that the most likely explanation for the bumps was their initial interpretation as feather quill knobs. The authors admitted that it was unusual for quill knobs to form along the posterolateral surface of the bone, but also noted that the same arrangement is found in some modern birds, like the Moorhen.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} 30 upper limbs {{in order}} to study the tendinous <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> into the deep fascia and to verify whether they have a specific anatomical arrangement and to measure their resilience to traction. We {{have found that the}} fascia receives many tendinous <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions,</b> which are always present and exhibit a constant anatomical structure. In particular, the pectoralis major fascia always continues with the brachial fascia in two distinct ways: the fascia overlying the clavicular part of pectoralis major had an expansion towards the anterior brachial fascia, whereas the fascia covering its costal part extended into the medial brachial fascia and the medial intermuscular septum. The lacertus fibrosus was also composed by two groups of fibres: the main group was oriented downwards and medially, the second group longitudinally. The palmaris longus opened out into a fan-shape in the palm of the hand and sent some tendinous expansions to the flexor retinaculum and fascia overlying the thenar eminence muscles. In the posterior region of the arm, the fascia of the latissimus dorsi sent a fibrous lamina to the triceps brachial fascia. The triceps tendon inserted partially into the antebrachial fascia, while the extensor carpi ulnaris sent a tendinous expansion to the fascia of the hypothenar eminence. It is hypothesized that the tendinous <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> maintain the fascia at a basal tension and create myofascial continuity between the different muscles actuating flexion and extension of the upper limb, stretching the fascia in different ways according to the different motor directions...|$|R

The percentage area occupied by unremodeled bone is used in a linear regression model to predict skeletal age at death. Additionally, this method uses digital software to measure area rather than the traditional technique in which a gridded microscope is used to estimate area. The clavicle was chosen as a sample site since it is not a weight bearing bone and has little <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion.</b> These factors reduce the variation seen as a result of differences in lifestyle or activity pattern...|$|E

50|$|Contrary to M. aurita, T. tricolor {{uses the}} {{insertion}} of the flexor pollicis brevis to alter disk shape and adhere to a smooth surface, rather than detach from it. In addition to that, the bat uses suction, rather than wet adhesion (via sweat-lubricated disks) as the major mechanism for clinging. When unable to create a seal for suction, wet adhesion is in fact used, but only produces a very weak adhesion. Furthermore, {{in contrast to the}} sucker-footed bat, Spix’s disk-winged bat only roosts head-up, but can cling to a smooth surface at any angle, whereas the former can only attach head-up. As such, it is of note that M. aurita can concurrently make contact with both its adhesive organ and thumb claw, whereas T. tricolor cannot.

40|$|Objective: There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} {{on the role of}} the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) internal derangement. As a result, this muscle has been the focus of many reports attempting to understand its possible role in TMJ internal derangement. Study Design: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging exams of 108 TMJ disorder patients were assessed for types of morphologic insertion of the superior head of LPM to the condyle-disc complex and possible correlation with disc position. The investigation was made on the sagittal T 1 -weighted MR images in closed- and open-mouth positions. Results: There was a lack of correlation between attachment pattern of the superior head of LPM and presence or absence of anterior disc displacement. Conclusions: The explanation of anterior disc displacement based on the attachment type of the superior head of LPM is unlikely; the type of <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> does not appear to have a predictive or prognostic value for TMJ internal derangement. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Glottis is {{a medium}} {{level of the}} larynx, {{involving}} the vocal cords, vocal process of arytenoid cartilage, and the anterior and posterior commissures. This region of heterogeneous histomorhological structure has specific characteristics: the internal striated muscles, the outer and inner perichondrium, atypical intra-cartilaginous areas of ossification, and unusual <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> to cartilage. Microtomy of 3 thick successive sections was performed {{at the level of}} the upper surface of vocal cords. Standard histological staining methods were used. Microphotographs were taken by light microscope under different magnification along with histomorphometric measurements. Cancer spread is partially restricted by anatomic barriers: vocal ligament and tendon of the anterior commissure, and subsequently by the elastic cone. Easier tumor extension may be due to absence of the internal perichondrium and ossification of thyroid cartilage. Microvascularization of the anterior commissure is significant for tumor spread in glottis and paraglottic space. The role of commissural lymph network in local spread of the cancer is completely vague.

40|$|The {{skull and}} jaws of extant birds possess {{secondary}} cartilage, a tissue that arises after bone formation during embryonic development at articulations, ligamentous and <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions.</b> Using histological analysis, we discovered secondary cartilage in a non-avian dinosaur embryo, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri (Ornithischia, Lambeosaurinae).

It provides the first information on the ontogeny of avian and dinosaurian secondary cartilages, and further stresses their developmental similarities. Secondary cartilage was found in an embryonic dentary within a tooth socket where it is hypothesized to have arisen due to mechanical stresses generated during tooth formation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [107]-[110]) This {{thesis is}} a systematic {{quantitative and qualitative}} comparative analysis of the humerus found in 1932 at the Vogelherd cave in Southwestern Germany by Gustav Riek. Notable for the extremely robust size of the <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> of the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, this specimen is of considerable importance to {{the debate on the}} origins of modern Europeans. While the humerus has been previously only cursorily mentioned in the literature as Neandertal, or "Neandertal-like," this thesis suggests that the Vogelherd humerus represents an extremely robust Early Upper Paleolithic individual. Recovered from the context of Early Aurignacian levels at the cave which radiocarbon dates from Vogelherd and the nearby site of GeiBenklosterle suggest may date in excess of 3 5000 B. P., this specimen represents the earliest known human postcranial material yet recovered in direct association with the Aurignacian, and it allows direct postcranial comparison between Neandertals and Early Modern Humans in the Circum-Mediterranean area. The implications of this specimen on the debate over modern European origins are investigated with the conclusion that the Vogelherd humerus neither proves nor disproves any of the current dissenting theories on the origins of modern humans.

40|$|Bone and calcified {{cartilage}} can be fossilized {{and preserved}} {{for hundreds of}} millions of years. While primary cartilage is fairly well studied in extant and fossilized organisms, nothing is known about secondary cartilage in fossils. In extant birds, secondary cartilage arises after bone formation during embryonic life at articulations, sutures and muscular attachments in order to accommodate mechanical stress. Considering the phylogenetic inclusion of birds within the Dinosauria, we hypothesized a dinosaurian origin for this "avian" tissue. Therefore, histological thin sectioning was used to investigate secondary chondrogenesis in disarticulated craniofacial elements of several post-hatching specimens of the non-avian dinosaur Hypacrosaurus stebingeri (Ornithischia, Lambeosaurinae). Secondary cartilage was found on three membrane bones directly involved with masticatory function: (1) as nodules on the dorso-caudal face of a surangular; and (2) on the bucco-caudal face of a maxilla; and (3) between teeth as islets in the alveolar processes of a dentary. Secondary chondrogenesis at these sites is consistent with the locations of secondary cartilage in extant birds and with the induction of the cartilage by different mechanical factors - stress generated by the articulation of the quadrate, stress of a ligamentous or <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion,</b> and stress of tooth formation. Thus, our study reveals the first evidence of "avian" secondary cartilage in a non-avian dinosaur. It pushes the origin of this "avian" tissue deep into dinosaurian ancestry, suggesting the creation of the more appropriate term "dinosaurian" secondary cartilage...|$|E

Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were used in this work to achieve a direct view of the LPM on a large number of selected patients with dysfunction at the temporomandibular joint. The study population was composed of 92 patients, of whom 74 were women and 18 were men. Their age range was from 19 to 53 years (mean age, 31 years). The images were analyzed using the following parameters: symmetry of morphologic insertions of the upper head of the LPM, types of <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> divided into 3 groups (A, single bundle on the capsule and condyle; B, one bundle on the disk and a second bundle on the condyle; and C, one bundle only on the disk), and relationship between disk position regarding the condyle in patients with disk dislocations with or without reduction and upper head of the LPM. The chi-square test was used to measure the magnitude of the results. It is possible to impute to the C-type insertion morphology a negative prognostic value for a long-term improvement of disk pathology and to consider the possibility that this muscle may contribute to dislocating the disk when its insertion was directed only on the disk itself. When the upper head of the LPM was inserted on the disk, the percentage of disk dislocation without reduction was greater...|$|E

In 1833, four survivors were taken to be exhibited and studied in France, becoming martyrs and a symbol of their nation. The skeletal remains of Chief Perú were preserved and studied mainly by Rivet 1; these are the only remains certainly identified as belonging to a Charrúa. In 2002, the French government returned the remains to Uruguay, where they were buried with honours at the National Pantheon.

The remains of Giovanni de' Medici, so-called "dalle Bande Nere" (Forli 1498 - Mantua 1526) has not been investigated yet. The enigma of the fatal injury and leg amputation of the famous Captain excited curiosity of paleopathologists, medical scientists and Italian Society of Orthopedic and Traumatology which contributed to realize the project of exhumation and study of his skeletal remains. The aim of the study is to report the first anthropological and paleopathological results. The tomb of Giovanni and his wife Maria Salviati was explored and the skeletal remains were investigated. Anthropological and paleopathological examination defined: age at death, physical constitution and activity, skeletal diseases. The bony fragments of the leg were studied macroscopically, under stereoscopic microscope, at X-ray and CT scans to detect type of injury and level of amputation.

Endoanal MR imaging (1. 5 T) was performed in 100 healthy volunteers (50 women, 50 men) evenly distributed between ages 20 and 85 years. The essential anatomic structures were evaluated, and various patterns in men and women were recorded. The thickness of the anal sphincter muscles and the length of the anal canal were measured, and age- and sex-related correlations were studied. Sex-related differences included a significantly shorter external sphincter in women than in men both laterally (mean, 27. 1 mm +/- 5. 4 vs 28. 6 mm +/- 4. 3; P: <. 05) and anteriorly (mean, 14. 0 mm +/- 3. 0 vs 27. 0 mm +/- 53. 0; P: <. 051).

Based on comparisons among the theropod records from the Aptian-Cenomanian of South America and Africa, a partial explanation for the so-called “Stromer’s riddle” (namely, the coexistence of many large predatory dinosaurs in the “middle Cretaceous” record from North Africa) is offered in term of taphonomic artifacts among lineage records that were ecologically and environmentally non-overlapping. Although morphofunctional and stratigraphic evidence supports an ecological segregation between spinosaurids and the other lineages, the co-occurrence of abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids, two groups showing several craniodental convergences that suggest direct resource competition, remains to be explained...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The rectus abdominis is a long, {{flat strap}} muscle which extends {{vertically}} upward along the linea alba from the pubic symphysis below to the costal margin above. It is a flexor of the vertebral column and thereby {{plays an important}} role in maintaining the normal body posture. As it is a part of the anterior abdominal wall, the strength of the muscle plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of the anterior abdominal wall. Weakness of the rectus abdominis is seen mainly in multiparous women resulting in the divarication of the recti. The lateral border of the rectus abdominis forms the medial boundary of the Hesselbach’s triangle, which is the commonest site of direct inguinal hernia. It arises by two tendinous heads: Medial head arises from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis and the lateral head arises from the lateral part of the pubic crest and the pubic tubercle. The muscle is inserted on the anterior thoracic wall by four fleshy slips along a horizontal line passing laterally from the xiphoid process and cutting in that order, the 7 th, 6 th and 5 th costal cartilages. The paired recti muscles are separated in the median plane by the linea alba. The muscle is three times as wide superiorly as inferiorly. It is broad and thin superiorly and narrow and thick inferiorly. It has a tendinous origin and a <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> that is in the form of four fleshy slips that are attached in a horizontal manner to the lower part of the anterior thoracic wall. The rectus abdominis is enclosed in the rectus sheath, which is formed by the aponeuroses of the anterolateral muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The muscle usually presents tendinous intersections along its length. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out in the Department of Anatomy, Government Medical College, Kottayam by the dissection of 20 adult cadavers and 5 foetal cadavers during the routine dissection time of the undergraduates and postgraduates. The cadavers were obtained after ethical clearance and were embalmed prior to the study. The rectus sheath was cut by a midline incision to expose the muscle. Measurements were taken, intersections noted and photographed. RESULTS Majority of the cadavers studied (88...|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletal}} {{remains of a}} male aged 45 – 55 years displaying several bone anomalies were unearthed from the Alghero (Sardinia) plague cemetery ‘lo Quarter’, a burial site {{dating back to the}} 1582 – 1583 AD outbreak. The skeleton, whose stature is about 165 cm, presents a bilateral hyperostosis with increased diameter of the diaphyses of all the long bones of the upper and lower limbs; the metaphyses appear to be involved, while the epiphyses are spared. Marked thickening of the cranial vault is also evident. Radiological study showed irregular cortical thickening and massive endoperiosteal bone apposition; sclerotic changes are observed in the diaphysis of some metacarpals. Computed tomography (CT) cross sections of the long bones displayed a thickening of the cortical portion and endoperiosteal bone apposition. The individual was affected by a sclerosing bone dysplasia, a genetic disease characterized by increased bone density. In differential diagnosis, several sclerosing bone dysplasia, such as hyperostosis corticalis generalisata, craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia, pachydermoperiostosis and Camurati–Engelmann disease, as well as other disorders characterized by sclerosing manifestations, such as Erdheim–Chester disease, mehloreostosis and skeletal fluorosis, need to be considered. The anomalies observed in skeleton 2179 fit with the features of Camurati–Engelmann disease, which is the most likely candidate for final diagnosis. It is highly challenging to evaluate how such a condition may have influenced the individual’s lifestyle in terms of development, mobility and quality of life. This individual was probably symptomatic and must have experienced common clinical symptoms, such as pain in the limbs and fatigability. However, the strong development of the <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> and the degenerative changes in the upper limbs suggest that the mobility problems should not have prevented him from reaching a mature age and from performing essential daily activities.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} 14 th century the Medici, {{one of the}} most {{powerful}} and influential families of the Renaissance, achieved their fortune through banking and commerce. They gained prominent position in the political life of the city of Florence, which became the cultural centre of Europe. Lovers of the arts, the Medici were patrons of Michelangelo, Leonardo, Botticelli, Galileo and Benvenuto Cellini. Almost all the most prominent members of the Medici were buried under the vaults of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence (Sommi Picenardi 1888). In 2002, the Superintendent of Florence Antonio Paolucci authorized examination of 49 of the Medici corpses buried in the church. This was a unique opportunity to study the health conditions, lifestyles and causes of death of some of the most important members of this family. There are two main branches in the genealogical tree of the Medici family, which ruled Florence and Tuscany in the golden years of Renaissance: that of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1446 - 1492), and that of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, from John of the Black Bands (1498 - 1526) to the last Grand Duke Gian Gastone (1671 - 1737). The “Medici Project” intends to study the latter, which is the less investigated series. Aim of the “Medici Project”, coordinated by the University of Pisa, the University of Florence and the Superintendence of the Florentine Museums, is to perform an archaeological and paleopathological research on 49 of the funerary depositions in the Chapels. The research will include funerary archaeology, anthropology, paleonutrition, parasitology, pathology, histology, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, molecular biology and identification of ancient pathogens. The most recent biomedical techniques will be used to obtain as much information as possible about these important figures (Fornaciari et al. 2005, 2006). In order to study the bodies, we set up a temporary laboratory in the “Lorena Chapel”, the funerary crypt of the Grand Dukes of the Lorena Dynasty, which ruled over Florence and Tuscany after the Medici, until 1859. Following the exploration of some burials during the second World War, we first decided to examine the tomb of Gian Gastone, the last Grand Duke of the Medici (1671 - 1737). A dark marble disk with no epigraph, considered a simple floor decoration was removed, displaying a secret opening, with a small stone stair leading to a totally unknown hidden crypt. The small funerary crypt revealed a sort of raised floor level surrounding a room which hosted a large sarcophagus, and many small wooden coffins, completely collapsed on the floor, and covered by a layer of dry mould, as a result of the 1966 flooding. Dampness (90 %) and temperature (30 °C) were so high that specific equipment was necessary to control climatization at the entrance of the crypt. This climatization eliminated the danger of damage to the coffins and bodies, by the introduction of external air during the works of archaeologists. A number of funerary depositions were unexpectedly well preserved as for example the burial of a 5 -year-old child with dress, shoes and silver crown. The dress was formed by a red silk jacket with thin collar and buttons, in a flowery pattern with silver gallons, and large plus-fours of the same tissue. The external wooden sarcophagus of the Grand Duke Gian Gastone with a badly damaged lid collapsed in its interior contained another sarcophagus in lead, with a large Christian cross and six iron handles on the lid. The funerary deposition of the Grand Duke was intact: he was still wearing his funerary crown in gold-covered copper and was covered by the silk Great Cape (Cappa Magna) of Grand Master of Knights of the Order of St Stephen. Two large golden medallions, about 110 grams each, appeared at the sides of the Grand Duke’s head as well as a silver crucifix on the chest and a large lead tube, probably containing a parchment with some writings celebrating the Grand Duke. The study of the skeleton of Cosimo I (1519 - 1574), 1 st Grand Duke of Tuscany, revealed that he was a vigorous man, with anthropological age of 50 - 60 years, 1. 78 m tall, medium-sized skull and a narrow nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> were those of a very strong man (Robb 1994). The horseman markers were all present, showing the ergonomic pattern of a perfect knight (Belcastro et al. 2001). During adolescence, reveals that, during adolescence, Cosimo must have carried very heavy loads on his thorax, probably the armours of that period, as attested by the presence of some Schmorl vertebral hernias (Weiss 2005). The clinical history of Cosimo I is evidenced by the very rich archive data, including the reports of the ambassadors and court physicians. Apart from some well recovered diseases, such as smallpox, malarial fevers, gravel and bronchitis, we have a picture of severe early arteriosclerosis, with paralysis of the left arm, right hemi paresis, dyslalia, psychical instability, urinary incontinence, aphasia and agraphia. There is an acute articular disease, a sort of arthritis, named “gout” of the right knee, or generic “gout”. Finally, death was caused by catarrhal fever, probably bronchopneumonia, at the age of 55 (Pieraccini 1986). The paleopathological study of the skeleton reveals that Cosimo I suffered from diffused vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis, probably caused by his intense physical activity. Ossification and fusion of the anterior vertebral ligament and extensive ossification of the articular ligaments demonstrate that he was not affected by gout, as referred by the court physicians, but by DISH (Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis), an articular disease linked with diabetes and obesity. Ossification and fusion of the anterior right vertebral ligament, at the level of the 6 th, 7 th an 8 th thoracic vertebral bodies, is typical of DISH (Ortner 2003). At autopsy and embalming of the body (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005), the court surgeon tried to cut the skull at the level of the right parietal bone; only at the third attempt was he able to obtain a coarse horizontal cut. Finally, the skull was levered with a large chisel, which damaged the skullcap in three points. The study of the skeleton of Eleonora di Toledo (1522 - 1562), wife of Cosimo I, reveals that she was a woman with an anthropological age of 36 - 46 years, 1. 58 m tall, with medium low skull, high orbits and narrow face and nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> show a fairly good muscular activity (Robb 1994). The clinical history of Eleonora is characterized by many deliveries: she gave birth to 11 babies between the age of 18 and 32. Probably for this reason, from the age of 29, she developed pulmonary tuberculosis which, together with an outbreak of pernicious malaria, killed her at the age of 40 (Pieraccini 1986). A famous portrait by Bronzino shows a very thin and ailing Eleonora, affected by phthisis. The paleopathological study of the skeleton reveals that Eleonora suffered from a light form of rickets during childhood, as appears from the curvature of her tibiae (Ortner 2003). She presents pelvic skeletal markers of her numerous deliveries (Krogman and Isçan 1986). She also presented slight vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis. Finally, Eleonora suffered from severe dental disease, with destroying caries, probably due to loss of calcium caused by her frequent pregnancies. The study of the skeleton of Francesco I (1541 - 1587), 2 nd Grand Duke of Tuscany, reveals that Francesco I was a vigorous man, with an anthropological age of 40 - 50 years, a stature of 1. 74 m, a medium-sized skull and a narrow nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> are those of a very strong man and the typical horsemen markers are almost all present (Belcastro et al. 2001). This new data contrasts with the traditional knowledge of an intellectual, sedentary prince, all dedicated to his alchemic studies (Berti 2002). He was affected by acute bronchitis and bronchopneumonia at the ages of 20 and 38 respectively and after 35 years of age he grew rather fat, suffered from gravel with colics (at 44 - 45 years) and died of pernicious malaria at the age of 46 (Pieraccini 1986). His great interest towards alchemy led him to fuse rock crystal, producing the so-called “Medicean porcelain” (Liverani 1936), a sort of luxury pottery very similar to china in his laboratory of Pitti palace. Therefore, he was certainly exposed to chronic poisonings and the toxicological study of his bone tissue will be of great interest to establish the exact grade of exposure to the different substances. The rumors according to which he with his second wife the Grand Duchess Bianca Capello were poisoned together, by his brother Ferdinando - who succeeded him on the throne – with an arsenical compound, are certainly false (Pieraccini 1986). Owing to the frequent use that contemporary surgeons made of arsenical mixtures in embalming and visceral processing (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005), toxicology is unlikely to be able to verify this legend. The paleopathological study of the skeleton demonstrates that Francesco I suffered from moderate vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis (Ortner 2003) and reveals a well recovered fracture of the coccyx, probably the result of a fall. Finally, the section of the body of the sternum, clearly made to perform autopsy and embalming, is worth mentioning (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005). The Archduchess Joan of Austria, wife of Francesco I, was a very religious woman, as confirmed by the finding of her well preserved rosary, made in simple wood. Joan was an unattractive woman, as appears from numerous portraits and some contemporary reports even describe her as “humpbacked”. She had six very difficult deliveries and died during childbirth, following uterus rupture, at 30 years of age. Study of the skeleton reveals that Joan was a woman with anthropological age around 30 years, a height of 1. 57 m, medium-low skull and orbits and narrow face and nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). Her weak <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> witness scarce physical activity. There is section of the body of the sternum, clearly made to perform autopsy and embalming of the copse are confirmed by a section on the sternum of the body. The paleopathological study of the skeleton witnesses a large number of diseases, including: Prognathism, with a marked anterior projection of the mandible, resulting in the famous Hapsburg jaw; marked hyperostosis: ca 1 cm congenital thickening of the cranial vault (Ortener 2003); amelogenesis imperfecta: congenital malformation of the dental crowns (Aufderheide and Rodríguez-Martin 1998); severe scoliosis of the lumbar column with impressive deformity of the pelvis, responsible for her difficult deliveries and death by uterus rupture; incomplete congenital hip dislocation (Ortner 2003); clear signs of her numerous deliveries, such as enormous retro-pubic foveae, deep pre-auricular sulci (Krogman and Isçan 1986). A preliminary study of the skeletal remains of 9 immature individuals aged between 0 and 5 years allowed us to diagnose 6 cases of rickets, 5 cases of porothic hyperostosis and one case of hydrocephaly (Ortner 2003). It is very likely that rickets was caused by the scarce exposure to light of the children in the environment of the Renaissance and Modern age courts, while porothic hyperostosis was probably determined by prolonged nursing of the babies. These are the results of the explorations of the the first 15 out of 49 tombs, and include those of 9 children. The laboratory studies are still in progress. Another 39 burials, the majority of which are intact, will be explored in the next two years. The study of the Medicean funerary depositions and bodies will certainly expand our knowledge of the diseases, style of life, and tastes of the members of that dynasty, so important for the Italian Renaissance.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{history of the}} Medici family is well known [1]. It emerges that {{several members of the}} Medici family suffered from arthritic diseases. The term frequently reported by contemporary sources to indicate these morbid episodes, is “gout”. It should be remembered that the term “gout” was used in those times to indicate several pathological conditions of rheumatic origin [2]. This disease {{seems to have been a}} family disease among the Medici, as attested by the nickname “the gouty” attributed to Piero (1416 - 1469). In particular, gout is reported in the {{clinical history}} of Cosimo I (1519 - 1574), Ferdinand I (1549 - 1609), Cardinal Carlo (1596 - 1666), Lorenzo (1599 - 1648), Cosimo II (1590 - 1621), Cardinal Giovanni Carlo (1611 - 1663), Prince Matthias (1613 - 1667), Cardinals Leopoldo (1617 - 1675) and Francesco Maria (1660 - 1711). The archive data refer that Cosimo I suffered from several illnesses, including an acute articular disorder of the right knee, named “gout” by the court physicians, which appeared at the age of 49 and 52 - 53 [1]. The palaeopathological study of Cosimo’s remains reveals a series of lesions of the axial and appendicular skeleton. The skull shows hyperostosis frontalis interna. The anterior longitudinal ligament on the right-hand side of the column is ossified at the level of the T 6, T 7 and T 8 vertebral bodies; this flowing ossification forms a bony bridge between the vertebrae, appearing as a continuous line of bumps. Two other vertebrae, L 2 and L 3, are fused on the left-hand side through a bony bridge. Several thoracic and lumbar vertebrae present syndesmophytes, but without vertebral fusion. Marked bone spurs at the insertion of the ligamenta flava are also visible. Intervertebral disks and articular surfaces are normal. Ligament and tendon attachments of the appendicular skeleton show enthesopathies, in particular at the level of clavicles, humeri, ulnae, radii, coxal bones, femurs, patellae, tibiae and calcanei. A diffuse and severe arthritis affecting the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and the great joints is also visible. For Ferdinand I, the historic documentation attests that he suffered from many acute attacks of gout, generally of the left foot, typically positioned in the big toe, from the age of 33 until death. The first attack seems to have been dated back to 1582, when Ferdinand wrote to his brother, the Grand Duke Francesco I, referring that he was confined to bed or chair because of “…some catarrh has fallen down to my left foot. By God’s grace, may it not be podagra!”. In 1591 the court physician Giulio Angeli accurately describes a typical gout attack: “yesterday the gout started to pinch the big toe of the Grand Duke’s left foot and then continued to advance rapidly! Overnight the toe has become swollen, inflamed and painful”. The crises afflicted the Grand Duke also in the following years; furthermore, he started to become obese at the age of 41 [1]. The paleopathological investigation carried out on the skeleton of Ferdinand I reveals pathological features similar to those observed in his father. The vertebral bodies from T 5 to T 11 are fused in a unique block for the ossification of the right anterior ligament, conferring the typical aspect of a “candle wax” to this spine segment. The body of several cervical and thoracic vertebrae presents partial ossification of the right anterior ligament, but with no formation of bony bridges between the vertebrae. The intervertebral spaces and the apophyseal joints are normal. Ossifications of ligamenta flava, interspinal and supraspinal ligament insertions are largely present. The extra-spinal ligaments show massive hyperostotic changes. Enthesopathies were present at the <b>muscular</b> <b>insertion</b> of clavicles, scapulae, humeri, ulnae, coxal bones, femurs, patellae, tibiae and calcanei. The thyroid cartilage and the epiglottis are ossified and well preserved. Large rough bilateral calcifications of the sterno-costal cartilages of the first and of the last ribs are present, leading to a sternum with multiple ribs attached. Ferdinand I was affected by diffuse osteoarthritis, involving not only the spine and major joints, but also several articulations of his hands and feet. Furthermore, the skeleton of Ferdinand shows a peculiar lesion in the left foot. The interphalangeal joint of the big toe presents cavitations, erosions and osteophytic margins. At the peri-articular and articular surface of the joint a “scooped-out” defect, with partial destruction of the sub-chondral plate, is also visible. X-ray examination reveals an evident sclerotic margin, which involves both bones of the joint. The changes observed in Cosimo I and Ferdinand I meet the standard major criteria established for the diagnosis of DISH (Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis) [3]. Both skeletons showed hyperostosis of the column, with the involvement of at least three contiguous vertebrae in Cosimo I, and up to seven vertebrae in Ferdinand. Such changes were limited to the right side of the thoracic segment and diffuse ossifications of the articular ligaments and entheses. Features often associated with DISH, such as hyperostosis frontalis interna, ossification of the neck and rib cartilages and massive osteoarthritis, confirm the diagnosis. The lack of evidence of these diseases in the written sources may be due to the fact that, despite the dramatic radiological aspect, DISH is generally asymptomatic, as its manifestations are limited to back stiffness and mild pain. Paleopathological literature has reported several cases of DISH from different geographical sites and different periods [4, 5]. The aetiology of this condition remains uncertain, but has been related to various metabolic disorders, in particular obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have highlighted a link between the incidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and high social status, with particular regard to life style and nutritional patterns. A palaeonutritional study performed recently on the Medici Grand Dukes and their families confirmed the written sources. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis revealed a diet very rich in meat, as demonstrated by the δ 15 N high values at the level of the carnivores. The δ 13 C values, related to the consumption of fish, revealed an intake of marine proteins at 14 - 30 % [6]. The present study seems to further confirm the association between DISH and elite status. Among the five individuals belonging to the Medici family of more than 40 years of age that have been studied so far, two were affected by DISH. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the case of Cosimo “the Elder” (1389 - 1464), whose remains showed the stigmata of this condition as well [7]. Despite the narrowness of the sample, the high incidence of DISH in the Medici family is remarkable and a significant life style indicator, supporting the link between social status and risk of developing DISH in mature age. Furthermore, the case of Ferdinand I is of particular interest for the diagnosis of gout, of which very little evidence has been found in palaeopathology [8]. An alimentation rich in animal proteins, as attested by the palaeonutritional investigation carried out on the Medici family [6], may have favoured the onset of this disease. An association with obesity, diabetes and hyperinsulinemia is ascertained [9]. Modern clinical studies report a significant association between diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and gout [10]. As the aetiology of DISH has also been related to obesity and hyperinsulinemia, it has been proposed that the link factor between these two rheumatic diseases could be hyperinsulinemia, possibly related to obesity. Not only do the typical skeletal and radiological features observed in the bone remains of Ferdinand I confirm the data reported by the written sources regarding the arthritic left foot gout which affected the Grand Duke, but this represents the first documentation of the coexistence between diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and gout attested in palaeopathological literature.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the migration of tendinous insertions, periosteal growth and muscular traction was studied in young rabbits. Normal growth was modified in two ways: (i) {{the growth of the}} proximal and distal epiphyseal plates of the tibia was arrested by staples. as a consequence, the neighbouring periosteum, no longer stretched, stopped growing in length; insertions were thus no longer dragged by the periosteum and ceased to migrate. (ii) The nature of the insertion of the anterior annular ligament of the tibia was changed by sectioning the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle near its insertion and reflecting it proximally in a loop around the ligament. In this case the ligament migrated normally in spite of the muscular traction in a direction opposite to the direction of migration. It is concluded that the direct cause of the migration of <b>muscular</b> and ligamentous <b>insertions</b> is periosteal growth...|$|R

Métodos: Selecionados casos de eso ou exotropias aproximadamente concomitantes, sem sinais evidentes de paralisias musculares ou de processos de contenção das rotações oculares, em que se realizaram, apenas, cirurgias de recuo dos retos mediais (grupo A), ou laterais (grupo C), ou de recuo e ressecção em esotropias (grupo B), ou exotropias (grupo D), com ou sem transposições das inserções dos músculos operados. Resultados: Esotropias foram mais freqüentes que exotropias (nA = 66; nB = 28; nC = 27; nD = 22) e cirurgias com transposições (96) superaram as sem (47). A distribuição dos ângulos pré-operatórios (m = 42, 49 D, s = 11, 68 D nas esotropias; m = 35, 39 D; s = 9, 93 D nas exotropias) e a das correções obtidas (m = 38, 95 D, s = 13, 57 D nas esotropias; m = 31, 64 D, s = 14, 58 D nas exotropias) são praticamente equivalentes e, além disso, altas correlações foram observadas entre o ângulo pré-operatório e a quantidade da operação respectiva. Todavia, as correlações entre os ângulos pré-operatórios e os resultados proporcionais da cirurgia (em D/mm) foram, todas, baixas. As quantidades de correções adequadas quando considerados ângulos residuais de desvio de ± 5 D, ± 10 D e ± 15 D, foram respectivamente de 31, 9 %, 62, 8 %, e 80, 8 % nas esotropias e 40, 8 %, 55, 1 % e 73, 5 % nas exotropias. Conclusões: Embora planejamentos cirúrgicos e suas execuções produzam resultados coletivos satisfatórios, os individuais mostram ainda uma imprevisibilidade muito alta. Purpose: Retrospective {{study of}} surgical {{results of the}} correction of horizontal strabismus in a University Hospital. Methods: In selected cases of comitant eso- and exotropias, without signs of oculomotor paralyses or restricted ocular rotations, surgeries of: recessions of both medial recti (group A), or both lateral recti (group C) were performed, recession-resection for esotropias (group B) or for exotropias (group D), with or without transpositions of the respective <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions.</b> Results: The number of esotropias was {{greater than that of}} exotropias (nA = 66; nB = 28; nC = 27; nD = 22) as well as surgeries in which transpositions were done (96) surpassed surgeries without transpositions (47). The distributions of the preoperative angles (m = 42. 49 D, s= 11. 68 D for esotropias; m= 35. 38 D, s= 9. 93 D for exotropias) and of the respective obtained corrections (m = 38. 95 D, s = 13. 57 D for esotropias; m = 31. 64 D, s = 14. 58 D for exotropias) were practically equivalent. In addition, high correlations were observed between the pre-op angles and the amount of the respective operations. However, the correlations between the pre-op angles and the proportional results of the surgeries (given in D/mm) were always low. The amount of corrections when residual angles of ± 5 D, ± 10 D and ± 15 D were considered reached respectively 31. 9 %, 62. 8 % and 80. 8 % for esotropias, and 40. 8 %, 55. 1 % and 73. 5 % for exotropias.

40|$|Carnivorous {{marsupials}} of {{the family}} Dasyuridae represent a more generalized anatomical condition of both craniodental and postcranial features in comparison to other groups of Australidelphian marsupials. Plesiomorphic characters include polyprotodont dentition, didactylous (rather than syndactylous) pedal morphology, the retention of clavicles and epipubic bones, and an unossified patelloid. In light of the anatomy of the postcranial skeleton, we hypothesized that the muscular anatomy of the Dasyuridae would likely display a range of plesiomorphic traits. We performed gross anatomical dissection on the forelimbs of four species of dasyurid marsupials to produce anatomical descriptions and muscle origin and insertion maps for Dasyurus geoffroii, D. hallucatus, and Phascogale tapoatafa, together with comparative notes for Antechinus flavipes. These new descriptions were then {{compared with those of}} other marsupials from the published literature in order to establish the principal patterns in forelimb muscular anatomy.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} anthropological {{data on the}} Upper Paleolithic skeletons from Grotta Santa Maria d’Agnano in Ostuni (BR) {{and describes}} their anatomical characteristics {{in the context of}} remains from the same time period. The importance of the cave as a burial site was identified in the autumn of 1991 by Donato Coppola who noticed a few human bones in the roof of a small cavity existing below the floor of the upper cave of Santa Maria d’Agnano. This unique situation, resulting from the partial natural erosion of the deposit underlying the burial, had exposed and made visible from below various elements of an adult human skeleton (Ostuni 1) and some elements of a foetal skeleton (Ostuni 1 b). The precarious conditions of the deposit and of the remains (which seemed to be suspended on the ceiling of the cavity), as well as the need to preserve the two skeletons in the original position required isolation and rapid removal of the bulk of sediment containing the burial. During this phase, a second burial (Ostuni 2), located not far from the first but not visible in the ceiling of the lower cavity, necessitated further preservation. Two blocks of sediment containing the burials were removed and transported in the Museum of ‘Civiltà Preclassiche’ in Ostuni where the subsequent work took place. The state of preservation of the remains and maintenance of the mutual positions of the skeletal elements within the deposit, attest the success and efficiency of the recovery operations. The second burial of Grotta Santa Maria d’Agnano was completely embedded in a very tough concrete-like sediment, impossible to remove without damaging the bones. The skeleton, probably lying prevalently on its right side, and in a flexed position, belongs to an adult individual, based on dental eruption and wear. Sex can not be diagnosed. The remains from the first burial, due to the less concretionary nature of deposit, were in an excellent state of preservation and not too difficult to isolate. This burial is very peculiar, including the remains of a young woman in advanced state of pregnancy. These remains therefore refer to a maternal skeleton (Ostuni 1) and to a foetal skeleton (Ostuni 1 b). The maternal skeleton was lying on its left side and in a flexed position. The lower limb bones were flexed both at the hip and knee. The right forearm was placed across the abdominal area with the hand resting on the left ilium. The left arm was completely flexed and the hand was placed under the cranium that was laid on the left side and facing downwards. The foetal skeleton was found in the maternal abdominal area. The elements of the cranial vault, in particular the parietals, were recovered under the right maternal pubic bone and not far from the foetal mandible. In correspondence to the maternal promontory, on the ventral face of the first sacral element, the foetal upper limb bones were found approximately in anatomical connection and strongly flexed. The thoracic elements were lying in part on the sacrum, i. e. in the lower region of the maternal iliac cavity, while the foetal spine appear oriented along the longitudinal axis of the maternal body. Cranially, on the left iliac crest, the diaphyses of the tibia and fibula were found partly covered by the right maternal radius. The foetal femurs and the two iliac portions of the pelvis were located at the extremity of and lateral to the foetal tibia, and nearly touching the distal portion of the right maternal radius. The foetal head, therefore, occupied the lesser pelvis while the body and the limbs were found approximately in the greater pelvis. The maternal skeleton is almost complete. Only a few hand bones are missing, while most of the foot bones are still embedded in the sediments; minor loss occurred in the basilar part of the occipital bone and in the facial and orbital areas. The state of conservation of the remains is good. The Ostuni 1 skeleton is certainly among the most complete and best preserved specimen from the Gravettian period. Anthropological study of the skeleton indicates that metric and morphological characteristics of Ostuni 1 fit well in the variability of Upper Paleolithic European female remains. Cranial measurements do not exceed one standard deviation from the mean of the comparative female sample, with the only exception of the orbital height which is much lower. The extraordinary circumstances and complex recovery technique that enabled the preservation of maternal-foetal anatomical relations make the Ostuni 1 remains particularly important from a methodo¬logical perspective. Since the sex of this individual is known, the focus is on how female characteristics are expressed in an Upper Paleolithic specimen. Morphologic and metric analyses of the sexually differentiated structure of the pelvis reveal, with respect to modern standards, clear female characteristics particularly for the ischio-pubic region. The results provided by the sacro-iliac region are less clear, probably due to the role these anatomical components play in locomotion and load bearing. The estimated age at death, based on degree of epiphysial fusion, cranial suture synostosis, dental eruption and wear and on the morphology of the pubic simphysis, point to a young adult age not exceeding 20 years. Due to its excellent state of conservation, the Ostuni 1 skeleton provides additional possibilities for methodological tests. The preservation of the bony elements contributing to determine stature allows the application of the so-called ‘anatomic method’, producing good approximation of the actual stature. The “anatomical” estimate has been compared with those obtained from equations based on the correlation between bone length and stature. Among the equations tested, those published by Formicola and Franceschi (1996), Olivier and coll. (1978), and by Trotter and Gleser (1952) for Afro-Americans, provide estimates close to the anatomical value. The resulting stature of 171 cm represents one of the highest values found in the European Upper Palaeolithic female sample. With regard to body proportions, ratios between limb segments indicate a relatively long distal part of the upper limb, as is typical in Gravettian and subsequent Upper Paleolithic samples. In modern populations, proportions similar to those found in Ostuni 1 characterize North Africans and are quite different from those exhibited by European groups. Regarding the lower limb, however, the distal segment of Ostuni 1 is not elongated and the proportions are therefore more similar to those of modern Europeans than to those of Upper Paleolithic and recent North African groups. Consequently, while the femur/trunk ratio indicates a short trunk as in recent North Africans and Early Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) samples, the tibia/trunk ratio provides a different picture. In summary, the presence of an elongated body build in Ostuni 1 is shown in the proportions of the upper limb and relative shortness of the trunk with respect to the femur, but not in the relation of tibia to femur and trunk lengths. The post-cranial skeleton of Ostuni 1 is in general quite robust, based on <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions</b> and bone remodeling. Metrical robusticity of the humeri denotes an asymmetry, which is evident also {{in the development of the}} <b>muscular</b> <b>insertions,</b> more marked on the right. The lower limb bones do not show elevated levels of robusticity, as measured by external diaphyseal circumferences relative to bone length. The degree of robusticity of femur and tibia, in comparison to other Italian female samples, is moderate. However both bones show characteristics indicative of intense activity such as a third trochanter, an ipotrochanteric fossa, accentuated linea aspera with very elevated pilasteric index, and very prominent inter¬osseous crest and tuberosity on the tibia and deep grooves on the fibula. The state of preservation of the foetal remains (Ostuni 1 b) is also exceptionally good, considering the fragility of a skeleton in a very precocious stage of development. Ostuni 1 b, in spite of the loss of a few elements (shoulder blades, clavicle, most of the cervical elements of the spinal column and the first costal elements) preserves in general at least one of the paired bones. It is likely that while a few elements were lost when part of the sediment collapsed, the pelvis of the mother prevented the fall under the burial of most of the foetal remains. The preservation of this precious and fragile skeleton, surviving natural and human events over such a considerable period of time, was made possible also thanks to the conservation and protection efforts carried out immediately after the discovery. The efficiency of this intervention is stressed by the maintenance of the maternal-foetal anatomical relations which are typically established during pregnancy. To describe their arrangement, the definition of the foetal position given by a midwife’s manual can be used effectively: ‘body ventrally flexed; head flexed towards the trunk, upper limbs adducted; forearms flexed towards the arms and crossed in front at the level of the sternum, thighs flexed over the abdomen; legs flexed towards the thighs and crossed in front of the ventral plane’ (Pescetto et al., 1986). It can be concluded that the foetal remains Ostuni 1 b were found in situ both from an archaeological point of view and from the point of view of their anatomical relation with the maternal skeleton. The degree of foetal development has been calculated using all the available measurements. Compared to modern standards, the resulting stage of development of Ostuni 1 b, points to a foetal age between 8. 5 (34 weeks) and 9 lunar months (36 weeks), and presumably in the later part of this period. The foetal length (vertex-calcaneum), determined on the basis of dimensions of the better preserved elements from the various skeletal regions provided an average value of around 45. 4 cm. This value corresponds to the empirical value obtained from modern samples at a foetal development of 9 months (lunar). Compared with modern samples, sciatic notch proportions and shape of Ostuni 1 b suggests female sex. The general morphology of Ostuni 1 b does not differ from modern European standards with the exception of specific population characteristics (e. g. body proportions). Other possible elements of ontogenetic differentiation, such as differential growth rates for the various skeletal regions, as suggested by discrepancies in the development observed in some bone elements, could result from individual variations or from population differences. Studies of paleo-ontogeny are very problematic as they are based on incomplete and fragmented remains, dispersed in time and not necessarily rep¬resentative of their parent populations. Thus, generalizations on this subject are of little use. However, the foetal remains of Ostuni, considering their completeness and excellent state of preservation, provide important and additional information on the issue of growth and development of immature remains from that period. Sites and human remains recovered in Italy have contributed significantly to the knowledge of biology of European Paleolithic and Mesolithic populations, but this is particularly true as far as the Upper Paleolithic is concerned. In such a context, the site and the human remains from Santa Maria d’Agnano in Ostuni (BR), provide highly significant and spectacular evidence...|$|R
40|$|Conventional lumbar microdiscectomy {{requires}} subperiosteal dissection of the <b>muscular</b> and tendineous <b>insertions</b> {{from the}} midline structures. This prospective, randomized, single center trial aimed to compare a blunt splitting transmuscular {{approach to the}} interlaminar window with the subperiosteal microsurgical technique. Two experienced surgeons performed first time lumbar microdiscectomy on 125 patients. The type of approach and retractor used was randomized and both patients and evaluator were blinded to it. In 59 patients a speculum-counter-retractor was inserted through a subperiosteal (SP) route and in 66 patients an expandable tubular retractor was introduced via a transmuscular (TM) approach. In both groups the mean age was 51  years, the male gender prevalent (61 %) {{and the distribution of}} the operated levels was similar. The outcome measures were VAS for back and leg pain, ODI and the postoperative analgesic consumption was scored by the WHO 3 -class protocol. A postsurgical VAS (0 – 1) was defined as excellent, VAS (2 – 4) as satisfactory result. In this study the patients scored from 1 to 3 points daily according to the class of drugs taken. Furthermore, a 1 / 3 point (class 1), 2 / 3 point (class 2) and 1 point (class 3) was added for each on-demand drug intake. Recovery from radicular pain was excellent (SP 68 %, TM 76 %) or satisfactory (SP 23 %, TM 21 %). Recovery from back pain was excellent (SP 58 %, TM 59 %) or satisfactory (SP 37 %, TM 37 %). Postoperative mean improvement ODI was: SP 29 % and TM 31 %. Postoperative mean analgesic intake: SP 4. 8 points, TM 2. 6 points (P =  0. 03). Lumbar microdiscectomy improves pain and ODI irrespective of the type of approach and retractor used. However, the postsurgical analgesic consumption is significantly less if a tubular retractor is inserted via a transmuscular approach...|$|R
