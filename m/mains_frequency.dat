25|$|The {{transmissions}} in 625-line format {{started in}} Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast. In particular, frame size {{was set to}} 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50Hz <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like <b>mains</b> <b>frequency.</b> They are typically used in power supplies, {{switched-mode power supplies}} and DC-DC converters for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as in}} industrial power supplies and frequency converters as DC link capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants. Special types are used for energy storage, for example in photoflash or strobe applications or for frequency coupling in audio applications.|$|E
50|$|Powdered iron cores {{are used}} in {{circuits}} such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above <b>mains</b> <b>frequencies</b> and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common. Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.|$|R

50|$|Saturable {{reactors}} at <b>mains</b> (line) <b>frequency</b> are larger, heavier, {{and more}} expensive than electronic power controllers developed after the introduction of semiconductor electronic components, and have largely been replaced by thyristor dimmers using triacs or SCRs.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a polyester film capacitor used for PFC.|$|E
2500|$|Five European countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, have {{standardized}} on 15kV Hz (the 50Hz <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> {{divided by}} three) single-phase AC. On 16October 1995, Germany, Austria and Switzerland changed from Hz to 16.7Hz {{which is no}} longer exactly one-third of the grid frequency.|$|E
2500|$|An AC voltage {{will cause}} an AC current (with an applied DC bias {{this is also}} called [...] "ripple current"), with cyclic {{charging}} and discharging of the capacitor causing oscillating motion of the electric dipoles in the dielectric. This results in dielectric losses, which are the principal component of the ESR of film capacitors, and which produce heat from the alternating current. The maximum RMS alternating voltage at a given frequency which may be applied continuously to a capacitor (up to the rated temperature) {{is defined as the}} rated AC voltage UR AC. Rated AC voltages usually are specified at the <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> of a region (50 or 60nbsp&Hz).|$|E

5000|$|The {{effect was}} first {{described}} in a paper by Horace Lamb in 1883 for the case of spherical conductors, and was generalised to conductors of any shape by Oliver Heaviside in 1885. The skin effect has practical consequences in the analysis and design of radio-frequency and microwave circuits, transmission lines (or waveguides), and antennas. It is also important at <b>mains</b> <b>frequencies</b> (50-60 Hz) in AC electrical power transmission and distribution systems. Although the term [...] "skin effect" [...] is most often associated with applications involving transmission of electric currents, the skin depth also describes the exponential decay of the electric and magnetic fields, {{as well as the}} density of induced currents, inside a bulk material when a plane wave impinges on it at normal incidence.|$|R
50|$|Transformers {{used for}} voltage {{conversion}} at <b>mains</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 50-60 Hz must be large and heavy for powers exceeding a few watts. This makes them expensive, {{and they are}} subject to energy losses in their windings and due to eddy currents in their cores. DC-to-DC techniques that use transformers or inductors work at much higher frequencies, requiring only much smaller, lighter, and cheaper wound components. Consequently these techniques are used even where a mains transformer could be used; for example, for domestic electronic appliances it is preferable to rectify mains voltage to DC, use switch-mode techniques to convert it to high-frequency AC at the desired voltage, then, usually, rectify to DC. The entire complex circuit is cheaper and more efficient than a simple mains transformer circuit of the same output.|$|R
2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} usually {{supply power}} to the lamp at a frequency of [...] or higher, rather than the <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> of this substantially eliminates the stroboscopic effect of flicker, {{a product of the}} line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see photosensitive epilepsy). The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E

50|$|One {{advantage}} of operating the transformer at the flyback frequency {{is that it}} can be much smaller and lighter than a comparable transformer operating at <b>mains</b> (line) <b>frequency.</b> Another advantage is that it provides a failsafe mechanism — should the horizontal deflection circuitry fail, the flyback transformer will cease operating and shut down the rest of the display, preventing the screen burn that would otherwise result from a stationary electron beam.|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of surface charge {{is an important}} parameter for evaluating the electrical performance of high voltage insulation materials. The method proposed allows on line {{measurement of}} charge and can generate two-dimensional images that represent the charge behaviour {{on the surface of}} the material under test. The measurement system utilises Pockels effect by using a wafer of bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) as the sensing element. This method allows non-destructive measurements since no direct electric signal or component interferes with the surface charge. Unlike conventional surface charge measurement systems, this approach can dynamically observe and simultaneously quantify surface charge. This allows the surface charge distribution under the influence of a time varying electrical field to be studied. the system's accuracy and sensitivity have been improved through the use of an optical phase modulator. The system uses a high speed CCD camera and a purpose built synchronisation control circuit to obtain a high temporal resolution. This has allowed the study of charge behaviour at <b>mains</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Surface charge distributions have been observed by applying AC voltages to a needle electrode in direct contact with the BSO. AC surface discharge behaviour of polymeric materials bonded to the back-face of the BSO has also been investigated...|$|R

50|$|For a {{broadcasting}} installation, {{a typical}} carrier current transmitter has an output {{in the range}} 5 to 30 watts. However, electrical wiring is a very inefficient antenna, and {{this results in a}} transmitted effective radiated power of less than one watt, and the distance that signals can be picked up is usually less than 60 meters (200 feet) from the wires. Transmission sound quality can be good, although it sometimes includes the low <b>frequency</b> <b>mains</b> hum interference produced by the alternating current. However, not all listeners notice this hum, nor is it reproduced well by all receivers.|$|R
50|$|Electrical network {{frequency}} (ENF) analysis is a forensic science technique for validating audio recordings by comparing frequency changes in background mains hum {{in the recording}} with long-term high-precision historical records of <b>mains</b> <b>frequency</b> changes from a database.

50|$|The main {{serves as}} a partial {{alternative}} transfer system to existing trunk <b>mains</b> suffering increasing <b>frequencies</b> and severities of leaks and bursts. Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, {{and there has been}} both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies. This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment. The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.|$|R
