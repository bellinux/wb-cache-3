50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to hammer drilling with <b>masonry</b> <b>drills</b> in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide {{back and forth like a}} piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{standard}} sizes of SDS: SDS-plus (or SDSplus or SDS+), SDS-Top and SDS-max. SDS-plus {{is the most}} common by count of tools manufactured, with <b>masonry</b> <b>drills</b> from 4 mm diameter to 30 mm (and from 5/32" [...] to 1-1/4") diameter ordinarily available. The shortest SDS-plus masonry drill bits are about 110 mm overall length, and the longest 1500 mm. SDS-max is more common for larger rotary hammers and chipping guns, and common sizes start at 1/2" [...] diameter up to 1-3/4" [...] diameter. Standard lengths are between 12" [...] - 21". SDS-Top has been largely phased out in North America and is not common except for older tools. Hilti's TE-S system is similar to these SDS systems, but is designed for chipping only (no rotation) in tools for applications larger than could be handled by SDS-Max (e.g. demolition of concrete walls or floors).|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary hammer}} drill (also known as a rotary hammer, roto hammer <b>drill</b> or <b>masonry</b> <b>drill)</b> {{combines}} a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that {{have been designed to}} withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for <b>masonry</b> <b>drilling</b> only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam.|$|R
5000|$|Core drills used {{in metal}} are called annular cutters. Core drills used for {{concrete}} are generally called Diamond Core Drills and are water cooled. [...] For <b>drilling</b> <b>masonry,</b> carbide core <b>drills</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a cutting tool {{attachment}} or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for boring holes in various materials or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS <b>masonry</b> <b>drill),</b> countersinking, counterboring, or other operations.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} {{hammer drill}} accepts 6 mm (1/4 inch) and 13 mm (1/2 inch) drill bits, while a rotary hammer uses SDS or Spline Shank bits. These heavy bits are adept at pulverising the <b>masonry</b> and <b>drill</b> into this hard material with relative ease.|$|R
2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the <b>masonry</b> <b>drill</b> bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|R
25|$|A , {{similar in}} {{appearance}} and function to a hole punch or chisel, {{is used as}} a hand powered drill in conjunction with a hammer to drill into stone and <b>masonry.</b> A star <b>drill</b> bit's cutting edge consists of several blades joined at the center to form a star pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{hammer drill}} {{is similar to}} a {{standard}} electric drill, with the exception that it is provided with a hammer action for <b>drilling</b> <b>masonry.</b> The hammer action may be engaged or disengaged as required. Most electric hammer drills are rated (input power) at between 600 and 1100 watts. The efficiency is usually 50-60% i.e. 1000 watts of input is converted into 500-600 watts of output (rotation of the drill and hammering action).|$|R
2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the <b>masonry</b> at the <b>drill</b> bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. [...] Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel integrated methodology {{for the experimental}} characterization of historical mortars, including different types of laboratory tests. Different experimental tests on lime mortar brickwork were carried out, including Brazilian tests on core <b>drilled</b> <b>masonry</b> samples with one diametral mortar joint and double punch tests on extracted mortar joints. By representing the mortar’s state of failure on the Mohr’s plane for the different tests, {{it is possible to}} estimate the material’s strength envelope through a least square minimization method. The proposed approach can be useful to evaluate the compressive, tensile and shear behaviour of mortar in existing structures. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, there {{remained}} {{critics who}} felt that McKeown was falling short, particularly for his negligence {{of the role of}} Public Health. [...] A semantic problem, as pointed out by Simon Szreter (2002), is that Public Health is a poorly defined field of medicine in the twilight zone between the responsibility of the state or government and health care provided by physicians and nurses. [...] The drilling of clean water wells, the construction of sewage systems, and legislation resulting in better housing, better education and improved working conditions is in most countries the responsibilities of the state, and it is surely {{not a good idea to}} make a public health professional responsible for the <b>drilling,</b> <b>masonry</b> and the enforcement of housing regulation. McKeown was not a politician, and it is quite absurd to hold him responsible for the ‘virtual dismantlement (of public health) during the last 2 decades of the 20th century’. McKeown was actively involved in the organization of medical care in Britain, and he was a frequent advisor for the WHO, and yes, together with Archie Cochrane, he was fairly critical about a wild growth of unevaluated public health interventions and expensive medical care facilities of which the efficacy had not been demonstrated. But nowhere in his papers, reports nor his books did he advocate the dismantlement of the (British national) health system, nor did he promote free market economy (which very few economists still consider a benefit to economy).|$|R
40|$|New {{approaches}} to assess masonry decay {{are required to}} help in the preservation of built heritage, including maintenance costs, especially in Scotland. Consistent methods of measurement and empirical data analysis to evaluate the progress of weathering have to be defined to substantiate the classification of stone decay. Our project aims to identify the exact length scale (nanometre to centimetre) and timescale (seconds to years) of weathering processes. Developing two new non-/minimally invasive tools will improve our assessment of the state of decay and help to determine which stone(s) need to be replaced. The project focusses on assessing sandstone <b>masonry</b> with a <b>drilling</b> tool to estimate the structural properties and a laser interferometer to measure dilatation over time to nanometre precision. The ultrasonic drilling tool allows the identification of changes in the structure of a sample while drilling a hole to a depth of some millimetres. By measuring the force or power required to drill, porosity changes and/or the presence of salt at depth within the sample can be mapped. The use of ultrasonic tools enables penetration of the rock with less damage to vulnerable stone. With the laser interferometer we aim to observe precisely weathering processes like swelling of clay minerals or salt crystallisation, because of the high spatial and temporal resolutions of the device. The laser interferometer allows measurement of very small (nanometre) scale expansion of a sample and can identify the effects of hourly or daily changes in stone condition. The developed techniques allow for better prediction of the decay processes, including upscaling from the lab to the field, and can potentially be used in situ on historical buildings under site conditions...|$|R
