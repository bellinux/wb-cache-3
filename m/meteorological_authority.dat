50|$|When an {{aircraft}} is in flight, {{it is moving}} relative {{to the body of}} air through which it is flying; therefore maintaining an accurate ground track is not as easy as it might appear, unless there is no wind at all—a very rare occurrence. The pilot must adjust heading to compensate for the wind, in order to follow the ground track. Initially the pilot will calculate headings to fly for each leg of the trip prior to departure, using the forecast wind directions and speeds supplied by the <b>meteorological</b> <b>authorities</b> for the purpose. These figures are generally accurate and updated several times per day, but the unpredictable nature of the weather means that the pilot must be prepared to make further adjustments in flight. A general aviation (GA) pilot will often make use of either the E6B flight computer - a type of slide rule - or a purpose-designed electronic navigational computer to calculate initial headings.|$|R

This, however, did not wholly explain the matter, for, even where the plants might be expected to recover from the action of the fire, their vitality seemed to be checked by the dryness of the climate. This was a discovery surprising to a Victorian, who had been accustomed to consider the climate of Tasmania a humid one.

The passenger ferry services linking the southern island province of Hainan {{and the rest of the}} nation were halted as typhoon Nesat neared land. Nesat was expected to be the strongest to hit Hainan in six years. The Hainan provincial meteorological bureau's director, Cai Qinbo, advised all people living in coastal areas to evacuate and also to brace for flash floods and other storm related natural disasters that Nesat may bring to the nation. Ships were recalled, flight and ferry services were suspended and schools were shut as the strongest typhoon to directly impact Hainan in 2011 was approaching its final landfall. In order to ensure the safety of the children, most kindergartens, primary and middle schools in Haikou, the capital of Hainan suspended classes very early. The Meilan Airport in Haikou city canceled a total of 49 flights. In Hong Kong, many functions and activities were canceled or postponed because of the fast approaching storm. The Hong Kong's stock market, all courts, tribunals, court registries and offices were completely shut for the rest of September 29. Also, the education bureau announced suspension of all classes and the Hospital Authority suspended general out-patient and specialist clinics for the entire day too. In order to help people in need of refuge during the landfall, the city's Home Affairs Department opened 11 temporary shelters in various districts across Hainan province. Macao's public transportation system was also suspended after typhoon signal No. 8 was hoisted by most local <b>meteorological</b> <b>authorities.</b> Macao's <b>Meteorological</b> and Geophysical Bureau issued signal 8 while the storm was estimated to be about 350 km south of Macao at 4:00 a.m. local time.

40|$|Abstract:- The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a computer system to act as a tool for rainfall analysis and crop selection in dry land farming areas. The system was prepared using MS-Excel and Visual Basic computer soft-wares. Annual rainfall totals were collected from Sudan <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Authority</b> for different stations, for a period of 33 years. The system calculates the probability P (%) of occurrence or execedance for each rain observations and inversely predicts the magnitude of the rain according to any probability level. Then according to the planned probability determines the crops that can be grown based on their water requirements. The verification and validation showed high levels of accuracy in prediction. The comparison between the actual and predicted rainfall gave a high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0. 87). The sensitivity analysis of the units showed that different input variables can affect the output results. The system was applied for Gedarif (Sudan) by using annual rain amount for the years from 1977 to 2009. It was found that rain amount at 20 %, 50 % and 80 % probability were 638, 526 and 480 mm, respectively. These rain amounts are enough water to grow sorghum, and sesame, while sunflower can only be grown under 20 % and 50 % probabilities. Therefore the system can be used for pre-season management and decision–making with great confidence. I...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the expected impact of drought on the socioeconomic situation of the people of Elduiem locality area of the White Nile State, Sudan. Primary data were collected from 140 respondents elected using multi-stage stratified random method. Secondary data on the temperature, rainfall and humidity for the period 1961 - 1990 were also obtained from the Sudan <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Authority,</b> Sudan. Secondary data were also collected on crops areas and production from the Ministries of Agriculture in Khartoum and Kosti, PLAN Sudan and from previous studies, researches and official documents. Descriptive analyses and Lorenz Curve analyses were used to identify the socioeconomic characteristics and to estimate the poverty situation among the respondents. The Global Circulation Model (GCM) was used to simulate the expected effect of drought on crop productivity in Elduiem area. The present human mal-management of natural resources associated with the prevailing rainfall situation had resulted in low crop production, low income and severe cutting of forests for firewood collection and sales. The results of the study revealed high incidence of poverty and inequity in income distribution among the respondents in the study area. About 88 % of the respondents were found to live below the poverty line. The GCM simulation results indicated that the average productivity of sorghum estimated at 255 kg/feddan in 1996 / 97 - 1999 / 2000 would drop by 71 % in 2030, the target projection year. Similarly, the average productivity of millet would drop by Please purchase PDFcamp Printer on [URL] to remove this watermark. 62 % from the estimated yield 193 kg/feddan during the same period.

These sites are scattered {{on the floor of the}} oasis representing ancient civilizations. The Roman stone monuments in Kharga represent cultural heritage of an outstanding universal value. Such those monuments have suffered weathering deterioration. There are various elements which affect the weathering process of stone monuments: climate conditions, shapes of cultural heritages, exposed time periods, terrains, and vegetation around them, etc. Among these, climate conditions are the most significant factor affecting the deterioration Archeological sites in Egypt. El- Kharga Oasis belongs administratively to the New Valley Governorate. It is located in the southern part of the western desert of Egypt, lies between latitudes 22 º 30 ' 14 " and 26 º 00 ' 00 " N, and between 30 º 27 ' 00 " and 30 º 47 ' 00 " E. The area of El Kharga Oasis covers about 7500 square kilometers. Pilot studies were carried out on the EI-Nadura Temple, composed of sandstones originating from the great sand sea. The major objective of this study is to monitor and measure the weathering features and the weathering rate affecting the building stones forming El- Nadora Roman building rocks in cubic cm. To achieve that aims the present study used analysis of climatic data such as annual and seasonal solar radiation, Monthly average number of hours of sunshine, maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, which have obtained from actual field measurements and data <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Authority</b> of El-Kharga station for the period 1941 to 2000 (60 years), and from the period 1941 - 2050 (110 years) as a long term of temperature data.

40|$|Drug {{stability}} is greatly {{affected by the}} environmental conditions especially temperature and humidity. WHO classified Sudan as zone III and recently in 2006 it had been classified by EMRO as zone III and zone IVA. As the climatic conditions in Sudan varies from one region to another, the study aimed at comparing these conditions with the internationally adopted conditions, to investigate the true transportation and storage conditions and their effects on the stability of justifiably selected drug products. The methodology was based on selecting six stations representing different climatic regions and six baskets of nine products together with Dataloggers were delivered to each station. Dataloggers measured and recorded temperature and humidity every 90 minutes during transportation and storage. The products had been tested initially, after transportation, after six months and lastly after 12 months using validated pharmacopoeial methods. The MKT for each station was calculated using data from Dataloggers, data from the adopted meteorological records and meteorological records {{for the same period}} of the study by the aid of stability system II, Scienteck MKT program. The resulted MKT for Sudan using the past adopted meteorological records is 31 °C and 34 °C when using the meteorological records for the same period of the study but the MKT of the controlled room temperature was 26 °C to 29 °C. The RH was higher in Portsudan, Damazin and Juba while the {{other parts of the country}} were very dry. The transportation MKTs for all stations were above 30 °C. Almost all utilized products showed significant alternation in the concentrations of the active ingredients. The results had been analyzedusing SPSS, Statistica and Excel software programs to compare the MKTs and to estimate the shelf lives of the products and the following findings were concluded: 1 - WHO used the mean of the past adoptedmeteorological records on calculating the MKT for Sudan and it was significantly different from the past and parallel meteorological records of four stations and it did not reflect the true picture of the actual storage conditions because of man interventions to improve the storage conditions. The mean temperature recorded by <b>meteorological</b> <b>authority</b> for the same period of the study was 3. 89 °C above that recorded by Dataloggers, and the room v average RH was 6 - 7 % lower than that of the open air. The most drastic and severe conditions for drugs were the transportation conditions which were almost above 40 C° contradicting EMRO recommendation which specified 30 C° as maximum temperature for transportation. 2 - All products were labeled to be stored below 25 C°, none of the storage facilities could maintain this MKT resulting in a significant decrease in their shelf-lives. 3 - With exception of metronidazole I. V in glass containers, all drug products utilized showed marked stability problems losing fraction of their shelf lives, which is attributed to the drastic transportation conditions, inappropriate storage conditions and some of them was due to quality of the products. 4 - Plastic containers for parenteral aqueous fluids and tablets in hospital packs may not withstand the environmental conditions of Sudan. It was recommended that the conditions pointed out by EMRO could be acceptable as an in-house MKT and the RH could be accepted with exclusion of liquid preparation in plastic container. DRA should take immediate actions regarding transportation conditions and it should instruct the reference laboratory to perform such stability studies for all registered products on the basis of EMRO guidelines especially for calculations of the shelf lives. It was also recommended to use the Dataloggers in-house MKT as a global method to determine the storage condition all over the world and if only the meteorological records would have adopted, the MKT for Sudan might be 34...|$|E
