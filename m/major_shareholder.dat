5|$|At the {{invitation}} of his uncle Moses Frank, Leo traveled to Atlanta for two weeks in late October 1907 to meet a delegation of investors for a position with the National Pencil Company, a manufacturing plant in which Moses was a <b>major</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at the Eberhard Faber pencil factory.

5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI's affiliation with Nissan could {{have been one of the}} reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a <b>major</b> <b>shareholder</b> of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ended his}} {{chairmanship}} of Oxford in 1987, {{when he took}} control of Derby County and became that club's chairman; still owning Oxford as well, he installed his son Kevin as chairman there. In late 1987 he attempted to buy Watford from Elton John, prompting the Football League to institute new regulations preventing the <b>major</b> <b>shareholder</b> of any member club from owning more than 2% of another League team. While Maxwell {{was able to keep}} his stakes in Derby, Oxford and Reading under a grandfather clause, the new rules prevented him from adding Watford to his football empire. He grudgingly accepted this. He retained his football club shares until his mysterious death in November 1991, when he apparently fell off his yacht near the Canary Islands.|$|E

5|$|Peake's {{portrait}} of Lady Elizabeth Pope {{may have been}} commissioned by her husband, Sir William Pope, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity.• See also Stewart, Cradle King, 113. She wears a draped mantle—embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes—and a matching turban. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques, as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate. The painting’s near-nudity, however, makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely.• Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction, 89. Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a <b>major</b> <b>shareholder</b> in the Virginia Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of large deposits of copper sulfide during the 1900s encouraged large mining companies {{to invest in}} Northern Rhodesia. South Afric{{an interest in the}} region was led by the Anglo American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa Company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. That year, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American; shareholders included the United States, South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company. As the BSAC purchased shares in Rhodesian Anglo American, the latter became a <b>major</b> <b>shareholder</b> in BSAC. By 1930, Chester Beatty's Rhodesian Selection Trust and Ernest Oppenheimer's Anglo-American Corporation controlled most of the region's mining. The Roan Antelope and Nkana mines began commercial production in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Chestnut Hill Ventures, led by American John Berylson, {{which have}} {{interests}} {{in business and}} financial services, retail, property and sport, invested £5 million into the club. The continued investment of Berylson, who has since become the club's <b>major</b> <b>shareholder</b> and chairman, has steered The Lions on a better course {{on and off the}} pitch. The appointment of Kenny Jackett as manager on 6 November 2007, proving crucial. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons Jackett led Millwall to two top six finishes in League One, in fifth and third place respectively. He won the League One Manager of the Month award three times while in charge of the club. Several of his key signings helped propel Millwall toward the play-offs, and eventual promotion. After a play-off final defeat in the 2008–09 season against Scunthorpe United and losing out on automatic promotion on the last day of the 2009–10 season to Leeds United by one point, Millwall made it back to Wembley, finally breaking the play-off hoodoo run of five successive failures in 1991, 1994, 2000, 2002 and 2009, with a 1–0 win in the 2010 League One play-off final against Swindon Town, securing a return to the Football League Championship after a four-year absence.|$|E
