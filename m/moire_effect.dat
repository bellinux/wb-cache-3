25|$|The grating {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase <b>moiré</b> <b>effect.</b> Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Moiré {{phenomena}} {{of different types}} are frequently encountered in electronic imaging. Most common are <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> that occur between periodic structures. These effects have been intensively investigated in the past, and their mathematical theory is today fully understood. The {{same is true for}} <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> between repetitive layers (i. e., between geometric transformations of periodic layers). However, although <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> that occur between random layers (Glass patterns) have long been recognized, only little is known today about their mathematical behavior. In this work we study the behavior of such moirés, and compare it with analogous results from the periodic case. We show that all cases, periodic or not, obey the same basic mathematical rules, in spite of their different visual properties. This leads us to a unified approach that explains both the behavior of Glass patterns in the stochastic case, and the well-known behavior of the moiré patterns in periodic or repetitive cases. © 2003 SPIE and IS&T.

50|$|The <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> also occurs between {{overlapping}} transparent objects. For example, {{an invisible}} phase mask {{is made of}} a transparent polymer with a wavy thickness profile. As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad moiré pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> and the classical <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal <b>moiré</b> <b>effect.</b> The phase <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> {{is the basis for}} a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Moiré</b> <b>effect</b> {{is used in}} shoreside beacons to mark {{underwater}} hazards (usually pipelines or cables). The <b>Moiré</b> <b>effect</b> creates arrows that 'point' {{towards an}} imaginary line marking the hazard; as navigators pass over the hazard, the arrows on the beacon appear to become vertical bands before 'changing' back to arrows pointing in the reverse direction. An example {{can be found in}} the UK on the East shore of Southampton water, opposite Fawley oil refinery (...)

50|$|The {{essence of}} the <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> is the (mainly visual) {{perception}} of a distinctly different third pattern which is caused by inexact superimposition of two similar patterns. The mathematical representation of these patterns is not trivially obtained and can be somewhat arbitrary. In this section we shall give a mathematical example of two parallel patterns whose superimposition forms a moiré pattern, and show one way (of many possible ways) these patterns and the <b>moiré</b> <b>effect</b> can be rendered mathematically.|$|E
40|$|<b>Moiré</b> <b>effects</b> {{that occur}} in the {{superposition}} of aperiodic layers such as random dot screens are known as Glass patterns. Unlike classical <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> between periodic layers, which are periodically repeated throughout the superposition, a Glass pattern is concentrated around a certain point in the superposition, and farther away from this point it fades out and disappears. I show that Glass patterns between aperiodic layers can be analyzed by using an extension of the Fourier-based theory that governs the classical moiré patterns between periodic layers. Surprisingly, even spectral-domain considerations can be extended in a natural way to aperiodic cases, with some straightforward adaptations. These new results allow us to predict quantitatively the intensity profile of Glass patterns; furthermore, they open the way to the synthesis of Glass patterns that have any desired shapes and intensity profiles. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 070. 0070, 120. 4120. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} is presented for investigating the superposition of {{any number of}} periodic structures, and the <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> which may result. This approach, {{which is based on}} an algebraic analysis of the Fourierspectrum using concepts from the theory of geometry of numbers, fully explains the properties of the superposition of periodic layers and of their <b>moiré</b> <b>effects.</b> It provides the fundamental notations and tools for investigating, both in the spectral domain and in the image domain, properties of the superposition as a whole (such as periodicity or almost-periodicity), and properties of each of the individual moirés generated in the superposition (such as their profile forms and intensity levels, their singular states, etc.). This new, rather unexpected combination of Fourier theory and geometry of numbers proves very useful, and it offers a profound insight into the structure of the spectrum of the layer superposition and the corresponding properties back in the image domain...|$|R
40|$|<b>Moiré</b> <b>effects</b> (‘Glass patterns’) {{that occur}} in the {{superposition}} of correlated random layers have long been studied. However, only little is known of Glass patterns which occur in the 1 D random case: namely, when the superposed layers consist of random line gratings, straight or curved. In this paper we study the properties and the behaviour of such Glass patterns, and we compare them with those of the analogous <b>moiré</b> <b>effects</b> between periodic line gratings. We provide for each case a detailed mathematical analysis of the fringe shapes and locations, along with illustrative figures which clearly compare the behaviour of the corresponding random and periodic (or repetitive) superpositions.

40|$|<b>Moiré</b> <b>effects</b> {{that occur}} in the {{superposition}} of aperiodic layers such as correlated random dot screens are known as Glass patterns. One of the most interesting properties of such <b>moiré</b> <b>effects,</b> which clearly distinguish them from their periodic counterparts, is undoubtedly the appearence in the superposition of intriguing microstructure dot alignments, also known as dot trajectories. These dot trajectories may have different geometric shapes, depending on the transformations undergone by the superposed layers. In the case of simple linear transformations such as layer rotations or layer scalings, the resulting dot trajectories are rather simple (circular, radial, spiral, elliptic, hyperbolic, linear, etc.); but in more complex layer transformations the dot trajectories can have much more interesting and surprising shapes. A full mathematical analysis of the dot trajectories, their morphology, and their various properties is provided. Furthermore, it is shown how the approach also allows us to synthesize correlated random screens that give in their superposition dot trajectories having any desired geometric shapes. Finally, it is also explained why such dot trajectories are visible only in superpositions of aperiodic screens but not in superpositions of periodic screens. © 2004 Optical Society o...|$|R

50|$|ASPs are {{typically}} {{composed of two}} gratings (a diffraction grating and an analyzer grating) above a single photodiode. ASPs exploit the <b>moire</b> <b>effect</b> and the Talbot effect to gain their sinusoidal light sensitivity. According to the <b>moire</b> <b>effect,</b> if light acted as a particle, at certain incident angles the gaps in the diffraction and analyzer gratings line up, while at other incident angles light passed by the diffraction grating is blocked by the analyzer grating. The amount of light reaching the photodiode would be proportional to a sinusoidal function of incident angle, as the two gratings come {{in and out of}} phase with each other with shifting incident angle. The wave nature of light becomes important at small scales such as those in ASPs, meaning a pure-moire model of ASP function is insufficient. However, at half-integer multiples of the Talbot depth, the periodicity of the diffraction grating is recapitulated, and the <b>moire</b> <b>effect</b> is rescued. By building ASPs where the vertical separation between the gratings is approximately equal to a half-integer multiple of the Talbot depth, the sinusoidal sensitivity with incident angle is observed.|$|E
