2500|$|In September 1929, discontented {{with the}} {{reintroduction}} of coercive grain requisitions and collectivization of agriculture, several thousand Soviet peasants of German descent (mostly Mennonites) convened in Moscow, demanding exit visas to emigrate to Canada, provoking a significant political scandal in Germany, which soured Soviet-German relations. The charity [...] "Brothers in Need" [...] {{was established in}} Germany {{to raise money for}} the Soviet Germans, President Paul von Hindenburg himself donated 200 thousand Reichsmarks of his own <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose. The Soviet government first permitted 5,461 Germans to emigrate, but then deported the remaining 9,730 back to their original places of residence.

Eventually, in May 2013, a settlement agreement was reached whereby Parker reimbursed the City of Kalispell $5,000 of their initial down payment. Jane Howington, who was the Kalispell City Manager in November 2010, said of the sculpture contract with Parker, [...] "using that type of <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> type of discretionary thing is not, in my view, appropriate."

2500|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{controversy over}} {{its plan to}} upgrade {{the conditions of the}} buses in the Anacostia area. A Metro survey in April 1991 found that the 75,000 bus riders in Anacostia were forced to use the dirtiest and most poorly maintained buses operated by the transit agency. Metro also admitted that although it had sent new buses to Southeast in 1983, the buses suffered from a high rate of breakdowns. Metro blamed the problem on its outdated and undersized bus garage at South Capitol and M Streets SE, and proposed building a new, much larger bus garage near the Anacostia Metro station for $30 million to $35 million. Metro originally planned for the bus garage to be built near the new Anacostia station, where many of the routes the buses ran terminated. But D.C. officials balked at that site (arguing the land should be used for development and would cost Metro an extra $3 million a year for 50 years to operate), and asked Metro to build a new bus garage {{at the site of the}} existing garage on M Street SE. Metro refused to budget <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> project, arguing that the Metro did not have the $40 million needed to buy additional land at the M Street site. In retaliation, D.C.'s representatives on Metro's board of directors vetoed funding for 16 of Metro's projects. The District of Columbia rezoned the land near the Anacostia station for commercial use in mid-1993, hoping to spur development in the area and prevent Metro from using the site for the bus garage. Washington Gas offered to lease [...] in southeast Washington to Metro for the bus garage, but concerns over the $26 million cleanup costs for coal tar pollution at the site led to the rejection of this proposal.|$|E
