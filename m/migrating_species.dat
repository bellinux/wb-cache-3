25|$|The {{range of}} the green sea turtle extends {{throughout}} tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with {{its own set of}} nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30°N and 30°S. Since green sea turtles are a <b>migrating</b> <b>species,</b> their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.|$|E

50|$|Over 20,000 birds, {{made up of}} 275 {{different}} <b>migrating</b> <b>species,</b> use the freshwater {{marshes and}} grasslands for breeding, resting or wintering.

50|$|The {{biodiversity}} and former tranquility of the isolated ecosystem changed during the Pliocene, when the Panama Block {{emerged from the}} seas and formed a transferable connection with formerly isolated North America.

50|$|Bitter Lake is {{especially}} {{known as a}} refuge for birds. There are at least 350 species of birds that have been recorded on the refuge. Bird activity varies year-round with Bitter Lake serving as a refuge for <b>migrating</b> <b>species.</b> Songbirds {{can be seen in}} the spring, especially May. In the summer months the refuge is home to many marsh and shorebirds. In the fall there are raptor migrations. Waterfowl concentrations rise in the winter. While some species such as the sandhill crane can number in the thousands, others have been spotted only on rare occasions.|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of marine <b>species</b> <b>migrate</b> within and without {{national}} jurisdictions and a small number occur entirely outside any national jurisdiction. Thus, the <b>species</b> <b>migrating</b> through waters {{under the jurisdiction of}} coastal states to high seas beyond the jurisdiction of any single state are defined as highly migratory species (HMS).

50|$|While <b>migrating,</b> the <b>species</b> still {{preferred}} bottomland forests, {{though it}} was reported in scrubby habitats when this was not available. During the Cuban winter {{it seems to have}} broadened its habitat to include most forests, ranging from dry, semideciduous forests to urban parks to swamps. Hibiscus forests may have been important.|$|R

50|$|It is {{not easy}} to {{establish}} whether a fish is sensitive to polarized light, though it appears likely in a number of taxa. It has been unambiguously demonstrated in anchovies.The ability to detect polarized light may provide better contrast and/or directional information for <b>migrating</b> <b>species.</b> Polarized light is most abundant at dawn and dusk. Polarized light reflected from the scales of a fish may enable other fish to better detect it against a diffuse background, and may provide useful information to schooling fish about their proximity and orientation relative to neighbouring fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} of {{international}} importance for migratory, over wintering and breeding wetland birds. Suitable habitat is achieved through manipulation of water levels and livestock grazing. The reserve supports an exciting and {{diverse range of}} birds. Amongst the breeding species found here are pied avocet, common redshank, common snipe, northern lapwing, water rail, bearded reedling, common tern and garganey. <b>Migrating</b> <b>species</b> include black-tailed godwit, ruff, little stint, curlew sandpiper and whimbrel. Overwintering species include brent goose, dunlin, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian wigeon, merlin, hen harrier, short-eared owl, Eurasian bittern and twite.|$|E
50|$|The Pavilion, {{the site}} for {{environmental}} programs, {{is located on the}} marsh side. A ranger and environmental educator assigned to the park leads such programs for children and adults, including moonlight walks and seasonal programs to view <b>migrating</b> <b>species.</b> Boy Scouts can participate in programs to satisfy environmental, forestry and oceanography badges. Since 2009, young men from local high schools have built three chimney swift towers near the parking lot and three bat houses in the park, to provide nesting areas to attract important species that help control mosquitoes and are struggling with loss of habitat.|$|E

50|$|The black {{woodpecker}} (Dryocopus martius) {{is a large}} woodpecker that lives in mature forest across the northern palearctic. It is the sole representative of its genus in that region. Its range is expanding in Eurasia.

50|$|Males usually start {{eclosion}} (emergence) {{earlier than}} females and peak in numbers before females. Both {{of the sexes}} are sexually mature {{by the time of}} eclosion. Butterflies and moths normally do not associate with each other, except for <b>migrating</b> <b>species,</b> staying relatively asocial. Mating begins with an adult (female or male) attracting a mate, normally using visual stimuli, especially in diurnal species like most butterflies. However, the females of most nocturnal species, including almost all moth species, use pheromones to attract males, sometimes from long distances. Some species engage in a form of acoustic courtship, or attract mates using sound or vibration such as the polka-dot wasp moth, Syntomeida epilais.|$|E
50|$|Skidaway Island State Park is a {{state park}} near Savannah, Georgia. The park borders Skidaway narrows, a part of Georgia’s intracoastal waterway. Trails wind through {{maritime}} forest and past salt marsh, leading to a boardwalk and observation tower. Visitors can watch for deer, fiddler crabs, raccoon, egrets and other wildlife. Inside the park’s interpretive center, birders will find binoculars, reference books and a window where they can look for <b>migrating</b> <b>species</b> such as Painted Buntings. A scenic campground is nestled under live oaks and Spanish moss, and some RV sites have sewer hookups. Leashed pets are allowed. Groups can enjoy privacy in their own pioneer campgrounds. Open-air picnic shelters and an enclosed group shelter are popular spots for parties, reunions and other celebrations.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-20th century, {{conservation}} groups across the United States began demanding {{the preservation of}} the remaining Great Dismal Swamp and restoration of its wetlands, by then understood as critical habitat {{for a wide variety of}} birds, animals, plants and other living things. This area is along the Atlantic Flyway of <b>migrating</b> <b>species.</b> In 1973, the Union Camp Corporation, a paper company based in Franklin, Virginia, with large land holdings in the area, donated just over 49000 acre of land to The Nature Conservancy, which the following year transferred the property to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. During this time, a 45611 acre portion of the swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1973 due to its unique combination of geological and ecological features.|$|E
