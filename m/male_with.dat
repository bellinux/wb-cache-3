5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older <b>male</b> <b>with</b> bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A <b>male</b> <b>with</b> browner and less bright plumage or a younger <b>male</b> <b>with</b> bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one <b>male</b> <b>with</b> many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet.

The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) {{has often}} been {{attributed}} to abnormal hip and knee mechanics in females. To date, {{there have been few}} investigations of the hip and knee mechanics of <b>males</b> <b>with</b> PFP. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the lower extremity mechanics and alignment of <b>male</b> runners <b>with</b> PFP <b>with</b> healthy <b>male</b> runners and female runners with PFP. We hypothesized that <b>males</b> <b>with</b> PFP would move with greater varus knee mechanics compared <b>with</b> <b>male</b> controls and compared with females with PFP. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that <b>males</b> <b>with</b> PFP would demonstrate greater varus alignment. METHODS: A gait and single-leg squat analysis was conducted on each group (18 runners per group). Measurement of each runner's tibial mechanical axis was also recorded. Motion data were processed using Visual 3 D (C-Motion, Bethesda, MD). ANOVAs were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: <b>Males</b> <b>with</b> PFP ran and squatted in greater peak knee adduction and demonstrated greater peak knee external adduction moment compared <b>with</b> healthy <b>male</b> controls. In addition, <b>males</b> <b>with</b> PFP ran and squatted with less peak hip adduction and greater peak knee adduction compared with females with PFP. The static measure of mechanical axis of the tibial was not different between groups. However, a post hoc analysis revealed that <b>males</b> <b>with</b> PFP ran with greater peak tibial segmental adduction. CONCLUSION: <b>Males</b> <b>with</b> PFP demonstrated different mechanics during running and during a single-leg squat compared with females with PFP and <b>with</b> healthy <b>males.</b> Based upon the results of this study, therapies for PFP may need to be sex specific.

40|$|The ´good genes´ or ´handicap´ {{model of}} sexual {{selection}} {{focuses on the}} evolution of female preferences for male sexual traits by using condition-dependence as the mediating mechanism. As the ´size´ of the preferred sexual trait increases, male fitness increases in terms of mating success, but this is traded-off with viability which decreases as the ornament size increases. Males in poor condition have lower optimum level of the ornament expression than males in good condition. Ultimately, females that base their choice on the size of condition-dependent male sexual traits benefit in terms of increased offspring viability (i. e. `good genes´). In the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata, males have a costly and condition-dependent acoustic signal, courtship drumming, which is the target of female choice. <b>Males</b> <b>with</b> higher drumming rate have considerably higher viability than <b>males</b> <b>with</b> lower drumming rate, and females that mate with the more actively drumming males gain genetic benefits in terms of increased offspring viability. Also, male mobility is positively associated <b>with</b> <b>male</b> mating success. In this thesis, I tested if higher immunocompetence level can partly explain the better viability of <b>males</b> <b>with</b> high sexual performance. I also investigated if <b>males</b> <b>with</b> high sexual activity can compensate costs of increased risk of predation. Further, I examined if fluctuating symmetry {{can be used as a}} short-cut measure of male quality. Finally, I studied if sexual selection for viable males has any population-level consequences. My results show that <b>males</b> <b>with</b> higher drumming rate had higher encapsulation rate than <b>males</b> <b>with</b> lower drumming rate, and <b>males</b> <b>with</b> higher mobility had higher lytic activity than <b>males</b> <b>with</b> lower mobility. I also found that <b>males</b> <b>with</b> increased investment in drumming rate had lower lytic enzyme activity than control males. However, encapsulation rate was higher among <b>males</b> <b>with</b> increased investment in drumming rate. This might be due to males investing their immune effort to components of the body where it is likely to be most useful. My results suggest that conspicuous sexual signalling increases the risk of predation, but <b>males</b> <b>with</b> high sexual activity might be better in escaping from predation than <b>males</b> <b>with</b> low sexual activity. My results indicate that fluctuating asymmetry was negatively, but weakly related to male sexual performance at the population level. Finally, my results show that male survival and drumming rate were substantially reduced only in the smallest wolf spider populations. This suggests that the indirect benefits of female choice in terms of `good genes´ might cover the reduction in viability in small populations. The results of this thesis suggest that, in the drumming wolf spider H. rubrofasciata, sexual traits are related to several measures of individual quality through ´good genes´, and that sexual selection may have significant consequences at the population level. Jari Ahtiaisen väitöskirjatyön tutkimusten perusteella voidaan todeta, että H. rubrofasciata susihämähäkkinaaraat voivat käyttää koiraan seksuaalista kuntoa mittana arvioidessaan koiraan fenotyyppistä ja geneettistä laatua.
