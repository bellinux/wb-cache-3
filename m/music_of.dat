5|$|BWV648 is a chorale prelude for organ {{transcribed}} {{from the}} cantata's fifth movement. It {{was first published}} around 1748 as fourth of the Schübler Chorales. The <b>music</b> <b>of</b> the cantata's closing movement {{is included in the}} Dietel collection, a 1730s manuscript containing 149 of Bach's four-part chorales. C.P.E. Bach published the same <b>music</b> <b>of</b> BWV10 as No.357 in Part IV of his 1780s collected edition of four-part chorales by his father.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again, probably in 1730. He later reworked the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> the opening chorus and a duet {{again in his}} Missa in G major, BWV 236, and the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> an alto aria in his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E
5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the <b>music</b> <b>of</b> the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
