The school puts a strong socioeconomical {{attention}} to {{protection of the environment}} and experts often are invited to make speeches on this topic in primary classroom.

A vast literature has highlighted those learning difficulties linked to common sense way of looking to energy concepts and its processing (Millar R. 2005, Heron P., Michelini M. and Stefanel A., 2008). Didactic proposals on energy topic of different approaches (Kaper, W. and Goedhart, M. 2002; Hobson A. 2004) offer to the teacher the opportunity to treat this topic revisiting concepts {{in such a way as}} to help children overcome the conceptual knots (Driver R. and Warrington L. 1985; Heron et. al. 2008) that the daily context poses. In a research based experimentation the HMS (HMS - Heron et. al. 2008) approach is adopted to build the concepts of energy by means of experimental exploration, and to complete a teaching of energy based on the content offered by text book: energy form, energy production.

40|$|This thesis uses Q {{methodology}} and an abductive approach to discover competing conceptualisations of how housing associations should be governed and attitudes to board payment. It identifies five sets of perspectives characterised as: 1. Business Focused and Corporately Responsible 2. Socially Focused and Stakeholder Accountable 3. Regulator Focused and Professionally Responsible 4. Leadership Focused and Governance Rigour 5. Pragmatically Focused and Non-Prescriptive The results confirm the hybrid nature of housing associations {{and that their}} governance is complex, multi-faceted so does not converge on one uniform consensus view. Power and payment emerge as two particular issues of contention, but at a more fundamental level the differences relate to conceptions of the role <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> exists to fulfil. The characteristics of housing association governance are not only analysed at a sector level, but are also explored on a case basis for two housing associations to demonstrate the potential of Q methodology as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>board</b> assessment. The thesis also considers the significance that the particular context, conditions and circumstances may have from a personal perspective. The thesis concludes that increased recognition {{should be given to}} exposing and exploring differences of perspective and ensuring there is clarity about purpose and approach. ...|$|R
