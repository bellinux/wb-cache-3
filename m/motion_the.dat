5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic <b>motion.</b> <b>The</b> transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda.

30|$|I use AlfvÃ©nâs frozen-field {{approximation}} {{to ensure}} that on large-scales (e.g. the co-rotation of the fluid around the axis of the Sun), {{the movements of the}} large-scale field (and flow), in a neighborhood, are directly linked together via large-scale <b>motions</b> in which <b>the</b> field moves concordantly with the fluid. This is done by moving each entity in longitude and latitude appropriately. As I discuss subsequently, when I discuss <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of our field entities, I shall be primarily considering <b>motions</b> relative to <b>the</b> steady-state fluid background <b>motions.</b> <b>The</b> background <b>motions</b> are simply <b>the</b> observed differential rotation and the meridional circulation.

5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and <b>motion</b> <b>the</b> influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E
