2500|$|After {{the success}} of her first solo release, the live DVD Dreamshow, which reached the No. 1 {{position}} in the UK chart in August 2005, Siouxsie received demos from several composers. Universal soon offered her a new record deal on the label W14, which {{was about to be}} created by John Williams, whom had already previously worked with her for Peepshow and Boomerang. Commenting on the news on her website in July 2006, Siouxsie stated, [...] "At least I didn't have to get someone spray-painting <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the Universal building"!

2500|$|With Presley's {{explosion}} in popularity in 1956, pressure {{was put on}} Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. [...] His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, [...] "During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees." [...] He explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "I was desperate. [...] When you're hungry, a poor man with {{a house full of}} kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. [...] I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' [...] I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and 'Rock It', a bunch of shit. [...] I didn't want <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it."
