40|$|An agar medium {{containing}} 10 % defatted milk {{has been}} tested as a diagnostic medium for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and, in particular, for differentiating between P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens. Only P. aeruginosa colonies gave clear zones due to hydrolysis of casein together with diffused green pigment. Results on milk agar correlated well with the pattern of results {{from a variety of}} conventional tests used to identify this organism. Pigment production of P. aeruginosa on milk agar was better than on special media commonly used to enhance this characteristic. Routine diagnosis of P. aeruginosa is recommended by streaking on a solid medium containing 10 % defatted <b>milk</b> <b>granules,</b> 25 % nutrient broth, and 2 % agar, and examining for clear zones and pigment after 24 hours' incubation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the thermal {{behavior}} of starch with and without milk proteins. The effects of two thermo-mechanical treatments: at laboratory and pilot scales were studied. Three media were used for starch pasting: NaCl aqueous solution, milk permeate and skim <b>milk.</b> Starch <b>granules</b> significantly swelled more when pasted in the pilot plant or during a longer time of thermo-mechanical treatment at laboratory scale. Moreover, whereas at laboratory scale the presence of lactose or milk proteins did not modify the swelling behavior of starch, a larger increase was obtained in presence of lactose (milk permeate) and milk proteins (skim milk) at pilot scale. At least, different dependence on starch granules diameter ratio versus relative viscosities were obtained at laboratory and pilot scales. Two complementary hypotheses on milk proteins/starch interactions were proposed to explain these results. Indeed, milk proteins could impact starch swelling through an increase of starch granules frictions during thermomechanical treatment but also through a modification of their surface characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanism underlying {{milk fat}} globule secretion in mammary epithelial cells ostensibly involves {{the formation of}} complexes between plasma membrane butyrophilin and cytosolic xanthine oxidoreductase. These complexes bind adipophilin in the phospholipid monolayer of <b>milk</b> secretory <b>granules,</b> the precursors of milk fat globules, enveloping the nascent fat globules in a layer of plasma membrane and pinching them off the cell. However, using freeze-fracture immunocytochemistry, we find these proteins in locations other than those previously inferred. Significantly, butyrophilin in the residual plasma membrane of the fat globule envelope is concentrated in a network of ridges that are tightly apposed to the monolayer derived from the secretory granule, and the ridges coincide with butyrophilin labeling in the globule monolayer. Therefore, we propose that milk fat globule secretion is controlled by interactions between plasma membrane butyrophilin and butyrophilin in the secretory granule phospholipid monolayer rather than binding of butyrophilin–xanthine oxidoreductase complexes to secretory granule adipophilin...|$|R
50|$|The organic {{component}} of calculus is approximately 85% cellular and 15% extracellular matrix. Cell density within dental plaque and calculus is very high, consisting {{of an estimated}} 200,000,000 cells per milligram. The cells within calculus are primarily bacterial, but also include at least one species of archaea (Methanobrevibacter oralis) and several species of yeast (e.g., Candida albicans). The organic extracellular matrix in calculus consists primarily of proteins and lipids (fatty acids, triglycerides, glycolipids, and phospholipids), as well as extracellular DNA. Trace amounts of host, dietary, and environmental microdebris are also found within calculus, including salivary proteins, plant DNA, <b>milk</b> proteins, starch <b>granules,</b> textile fibers, and smoke particles.|$|R
40|$|High-shear {{granulation}} is {{an attractive}} alternative to spray drying for producing dried milk products. The capital cost of a granulation circuit {{is likely to be}} much less than a spray drying circuit which will reduce the manufacturing costs of milk powders. This work investigated the high-shear granulation of milk powder using milk concentrate as a binding agent {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of granulation as an alternative to, or and improvement on, the spray drying process. This research has laid the groundwork for further investigation into milk granulation by defining the conditions for which granulation is achieved and describing the effects of processing parameters on granulation for a pilot-scale mixer granulator. The technical feasibility of granulation is shown by proving that granulation does not affect the quality of the milk. Designs for perceived continuous granulation circuits are included to aid in further milk granulation research. Successful granulation occurs at a total moisture content of approximately 11 % (± 1 %). This was found to be suitable using either reconstituted or evaporated milk concentrated binder at between 20 and 50 % total solids. The time of granulation affects the size distribution of the granules and the granule yield at the end of the process. A narrower size distribution with increasing granule sizes and a reduction in the granule yield is observed for longer granulation times. Granules were found to have better handling qualities than spray dried <b>milk</b> powders. <b>Granules</b> performed better in many functional tests having a higher bulk density, less change in bulk density during handling, better flowability and less fines. Granulation does not affect the chemical quality of the <b>milk</b> providing the <b>granules</b> are dried immediately after granulation. However, it was found that extended exposure of dried milk solids to a moisture content of 11 % results in an unacceptable amount of insoluble material forming. Granules are well suited as a product for reconstitution but did not perform adequately in wettability tests, suggesting that their use as an instantised product would require further study and improvement. Further research is required to understand the role of lactose crystallisation and the generation of insoluble material to ensure scaling up of granulation will be successful. An investigation into continuous granulation would be useful for further milk granulation work...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} for the school children to take the pure milk especially the goat milk every day because of the unpleasant taste and smell of the goat milk are not so good. Besides, the pure milk has a short life time. It is difficult to store the goat milk in {{a long period of}} time at room temperature. The solution for this problem is change the goat milk from liquid form into the chewable milk tablet that can be easily consume by the school children. Goat milk in the form of tablet formulation will increase the shelf life of the product. Therefore, the chewable goat milk tablet can be stored in {{a long period of time}}, convenience, and suitable for distribution to remote areas. In this project, the focusing was more into the optimization of the weight adjustment of the tableting machine before and after the dry granulation to form good chewable tablet. The pre-evaluation had been done for the goat <b>milk</b> powder and <b>granule</b> after dry granulation process. It can be concluded that goat milk tablet can be an alternative to the pure goat milk. The poorly flowing properties of goat milk powder can be improved by using dry granulation techniques. Based on this study, F 4 D shows the best setting to produce the goat milk tablet using dry granulation technique. F 4 D suc cessfully improved the flow ability and compressibility of goat milk tablet. It also produce the best goat milk tablet as it possess uniformity of weight, low friability and good hardness...|$|R
40|$|Remnants of lipoproteins, {{intestinal}} chylomicrons, {{and very}} low density lipoprotein (VLDL), are rapidly cleared from plasma and enter hepatocytes. It {{has been suggested}} that remnant lipoproteins are initially captured in the space of Disse by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and that their subsequent internalization into hepatocytes is mediated by members of the LDL-receptor gene family. Similarly to lipoprotein remnants, malaria sporozoites are removed from the blood circulation by the liver within minutes after injection by Anopheles mosquitoes. The sporozoite's surface is covered by the circumsporozoite protein (CS), and its region II-plus has been implicated in the binding of the parasites to glycosaminoglycan chains of hepatocyte HSPGs. Lactoferrin, a protein with antibacterial properties found in breast <b>milk</b> and neutrophil <b>granules,</b> is also rapidly cleared from the circulation by hepatocytes, and can inhibit the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants. Here we provide evidence that sporozoites, lactoferrin, and remnant lipoproteins are cleared from the blood by similar mechanisms. CS, lactoferrin, and remnant lipoproteins compete in vitro and in vivo for binding sites on liver cells. The relevance of this binding event for sporozoite infectivity is highlighted by our demonstration that apoliprotein E-enriched beta- VLDI and lactoferrin inhibit sporozoite invasion of HepG 2 cells. In addition, malaria sporozoites are less infective in LDL-receptor knockout (LDLR -/-) mice maintained on a high fat diet, as compared with littermates maintained on a normal diet. We conclude that the clearance of lipoprotein remnants and sporozoites from the blood is mediated by the same set of highly sulfated HSPGs on the hepatocyte plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} pressure-induced starch gelatinisation {{in water and}} milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed ‘pasting curves’, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch gelatinisation. In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules {{and the degree of}} starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced gelatinisation of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete gelatinisation after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the gelatinisation were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of gelatinisation was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e. g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of gelatinisation. Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced gelatinisation curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at = 500 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of gelatinisation at the levels present in 10 % total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead to less effective plasticising of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding gelatinisation by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20 °C, 30 min) or heat treated (80 °C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches {{can be explained by the}} extent of starch gelatinisation in skim <b>milk.</b> Starch <b>granules</b> absorb water during gelatinisation whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1 %. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch by showing gelatinisation properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of gelatinisation. Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced gelatinisation was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the gelatinisation properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone...|$|R
