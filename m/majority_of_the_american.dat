25|$|There {{is still}} a social stigma {{relating}} to atheism {{in the nation and}} polls show that a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people would be more comfortable voting for a Muslim or gay candidate than an atheist.|$|E
25|$|The term {{working class}} applies {{to those that}} work at this tier in the social hierarchy. Definitions of this term vary greatly. While Lloyd Warner found the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{population}} to be in either the upper-lower class or lower-lower class in 1949, modern-day experts such as Michael Zweig, an economist for SUNY–Stony Brook, argue that the working class constitutes most of the population.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, most polling shows large {{support for}} {{emissions}} trading (often {{referred to as}} cap-and-trade). This majority support {{can be seen in}} polls conducted by Washington Post/ABC News, Zogby International and Yale University. A new Washington Post-ABC poll reveals that <b>majorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people believe in climate change, are concerned about it, are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it, and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases. They are, however, ambivalent on cap-and-trade.|$|R

25|$|Only {{one other}} notable event {{remained}} in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces boarded and captured {{the crew of the}} Mayaguez, an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people seemed to approve of the administration's decisive action.|$|E
25|$|Although not as {{overwhelmingly}} supportive as it {{was from}} the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. The latest poll in August 2016 gave labor unions a 56 percent approval rating, versus 36 percent who disapproved of unions.|$|E
25|$|Suppressing a {{rebellion}} in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; {{it could take}} up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated {{by the time that}} they arrived. The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict, yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston. Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly {{in the power of the}} Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> population was agrarian, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.|$|E

A minority are effective because they employ knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local language and culture, {{but most of these}} are marginalized and some even considered suspect. As a result, their influence is more limited than it should be.|$|R

Dates were rescheduled for August and September. The year {{would continue to be}} difficult on the band for the US legs of their tours, as they were also forced to cancel two west coast festival appearances in mid-August due to the threat of terrorist attacks on US-bound flights from the UK. Two band members made it to the US while two were stuck in London. Subsequently, they all made it to the lone US tour stop in Boston days later but failed to recover any of their luggage, forcing them to shop for clothes on Newbury St. that afternoon. Their gear arrived hours before show time, just in time for sound check. The band also had to cancel appearances in Germany and France after bassist Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Today the Mercury {{program is}} commemorated {{as the first}} manned American space program. It did not win the race against the Soviet Union, but gave back {{national}} prestige and was scientifically a successful precursor of later programs such as Gemini, Apollo and Skylab. During the 1950s, some experts doubted that manned spaceflight was possible. Still when John F. Kennedy was elected president, many including he had doubts about the project. As president he chose to support the programs {{a few months before}} the launch of Freedom 7, which became a great public success. Afterwards, a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public supported manned spaceflight, and within a few weeks, Kennedy announced a plan for a manned mission to land on the Moon and return safely to Earth {{before the end of the}} 1960s. The six astronauts who flew were awarded medals, driven in parades and two of them were invited to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. As a response to the selection criteria, which ruled out women, a private project was founded in which 13 women pilots successfully underwent the same tests as the men in Project Mercury. It was named Mercury 13 by the media Despite this effort, NASA did not select female astronauts until 1978 for the Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|With the Age of Discovery {{starting}} in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the Americas. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the Treaty of Tordesillas purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, {{but none of the}} New World. The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> continents and the Islands of the Pacific Ocean. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500, when the Portuguese navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.|$|E

In September, the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.
