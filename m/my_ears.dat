500|$|Twenty {{years of}} hard work, twenty years of fun and frolic and jolly companionship, twenty years of living in an {{atmosphere}} of tuneful nonsense, with the glare of the footlights in my eyes and the thunders of applause in <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> [...] How terribly I should miss it all! [...] And domesticity, that all my life I had fled from, had caught me at last.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> to anything, really. It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t close <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Olivia {{attended}} a showing of The Land of Heart's Desire, {{and found herself}} moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the [...] "tall and black haired" [...] poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10May1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, [...] "I shall be {{so glad to see}} you". In his Memoirs Yeats referred to her as [...] "Diana Vernon", writing, [...] "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> and will suit as well as any other".|$|E

500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause {{to be grateful}} to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing in <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I feel that my reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E
500|$|The siege {{settled down}} into a routine of {{bombardment}} and counter-bombardment. This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as I believe you will have an [...] of. Some was for cuting (sic) my Throat and others for cuting (sic) off <b>my</b> <b>Ears</b> [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E

500|$|Santiago {{describes}} his guitar playing as [...] "angular and bent," [...] "all derived from guitar moments that perk <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> up". Notable in his style {{is how he}} uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' [...] "Savoy Truffle", where [...] "George Harrison played that bent note that I {{fell in love with}} and later milked it for all it was worth." [...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{collaborated with}} Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat in writing [...] "Bad Romance", with Khayat {{taking charge of}} production. The song was {{recorded}} at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles and FC Walvisch Recording Media Studios in Amsterdam. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was released as the lead single from The Fame Monster (2009), Gaga's follow-up to her debut album, The Fame (2008). Before its official release, a demo version of the song was published illegally on the internet, prompting Gaga to comment via Twitter, [...] "leaked next single is makin <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> bleed. Wait till you hear the real version." [...] A snippet of the song was performed on Saturday Night Live on October 3, 2009, along with [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "LoveGame". The final version of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] premiered during the finale of fashion designer Alexander McQueen's 2010 Paris Fashion Week show, and the song's release followed on October 19, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Endecott's {{instructions}} {{were to go}} to Block Island, where he was to kill all of the Indian men and take captive the women and children. He was then {{to go to the}} Pequots on the mainland, where he was to make three demands: first, that the killers of Oldham and the other trader be surrendered; second, that a payment of one thousand fathoms of wampum be made; and third, that some Pequot children be delivered to serve as hostages. Endecott executed these instructions with zeal. Although most of the Indians on Block Island only briefly opposed the English landing there, he spent two days destroying their villages, crops and canoes; most of the Indians on the island successfully eluded English searches for them. English reports claimed as many as 14 Indians were killed, but the Narragansetts only reported one dead. Endecott then sailed for Saybrook, an English settlement {{at the mouth of the}} Connecticut River. Lion Gardiner, the leader there, angrily informed Endecott when he learned of the mission's goals, [...] "You come hither to raise these wasps around <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> and then you will take wing and flee away." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{also used}} {{instruments}} {{that did not}} appear on previous albums, such as horns and violins. The members became more open to experimentation, but attempted to not over-produce the album; Stump stated that he [...] "had {{to resist the temptation}} to use a lot of strings." [...] "Golden" [...] consists exclusively of vocals and piano, and Stump dubbed the song [...] "much softer than anything we’ve ever done". The group utilizes a full horn section on [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in <b>My</b> <b>Ears</b> and None on My Fingers", a track which has been likened to Queen. Violins are used on both [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs", in addition to an acoustic guitar strummed flamenco-style, and [...] "The (After) Life of the Party", which also features electronic-influenced sounds. Commenting on the instruments used on [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs", Stump stated [...] "I never thought I'd get a euphonium onto a Fall Out Boy record". [...] "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave" [...] features a gospel choir, while [...] "Thriller" [...] contains a spoken-word intro from Jay-Z. Barry Nicolson of NME referred to the song as a [...] "towering, Foo Fighters-esque slice of thunderous rhythm and radio-friendly melody." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in <b>My</b> <b>Ears</b> and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> are open." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{listening}} to the album, Bryan Adams asked them to join his European tour. Whilst overseas, in November 1991, they won the Best New Act category at the inaugural Australian Music Awards. By Christmas that year the band were back in Australia for more national touring, {{and the release of}} two more singles, [...] "Painless" [...] (November) and [...] "One Word" [...] (February 1992); the latter peaked at No.15 on the ARIA Singles Chart – their highest position.

2500|$|Two of Rea's most {{important}} influences were the György Ligeti compositions on the [...] soundtrack and the King Crimson album In the Court of the Crimson King. In a 2001 interview in Exposé magazine Rea {{comments on the}} impact on his music: [...] "The former opened <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> to expanded conceptions of form and tonality {{and to the world}} of 'extended' instrumental technique, and Ligeti remains my favorite composer to this day. The latter showed me that rock music could be so much more than the usual foursquare pounding with juvenile lyrics." ...|$|E
