The study presented 4 patients with <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> complicated by thrombosis of splanchnic veins, aiming at the illustration of issue complexity in diagnostics and therapy. Two patients with portal vein thrombosis and recurring hemorrhage from esophageal varicosity were described. The first case was planned for shunting, while another case sustained bleeding on what account his anticoagulant therapy was discontinued, but it caused mesenterial thrombosis resulting in lethal outcome. Another two patients had hepatic veins thrombosis. Due to frequent, life-threatening bleeding from the esophageal and gastric varices, a patient with chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome and lineal vein thrombosis underwent mesocaval shunting. An immediate postoperative period was manifested by multiple thrombosis and hemorrhages that ended in his death. A patient with the acute Budd-Chiari syndrome was administered myelosuppressants and anticoagulants on time so reperfusion was restored.

50|$|Myelophthisis {{can occur}} {{in the setting of}} chronic <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> (e.g. myelofibrosis), leukemia, lymphoma, and metastatic {{carcinoma}} or myeloma. It is common in people who have chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. It has been linked to small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer that metastasizes to the bone marrow.|$|E
50|$|Many {{patients}} have Budd-Chiari syndrome as a complication of polycythemia vera (<b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> of red blood cells). Patients suffering from {{paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria}} (PNH) appear to be especially at risk for Budd-Chiari syndrome, more than other forms of thrombophilia: up to 39% develop venous thromboses and 12% may acquire Budd-Chiari.|$|E
50|$|Thrombocytosis (or thrombocythemia) is the {{presence}} of high platelet counts in the blood, and can be either primary (also termed essential and caused by a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease)</b> or reactive (also termed secondary). Although often symptomless (particularly when it is a secondary reaction), it can predispose to thrombosis in some patients. Thrombocytosis can be contrasted with thrombocytopenia, a loss of platelets in the blood.|$|E

5000|$|A classic {{symptom of}} polycythemia vera (and the related <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> {{essential}} thrombocythemia) is erythromelalgia. This is a burning {{pain in the}} hands or feet, usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin. Erythromelalgia is caused by an increased platelet count or increased platelet [...] "stickiness" [...] (aggregation), resulting {{in the formation of}} tiny blood clots in the vessels of the extremity; it responds rapidly to treatment with aspirin.|$|E
50|$|Cancers of {{the blood}} are 10 to 15 times more common in {{children}} with Down syndrome.

Transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease,</b> a disorder of blood cell production that does not occur outside of Down syndrome, affects 3-10% of infants. The disorder is typically not serious but occasionally can be. It resolves most times without treatment; however, in those who have had it, a 20 to 30% risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia {{at a later time}} exists.|$|E

5000|$|The {{myeloproliferative}} neoplasms (MPNs), previously {{myeloproliferative diseases}} (MPDs), are {{a group of}} diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are produced. They are related to, and may evolve into, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, although the myeloproliferative diseases on the whole have a much better prognosis than these conditions. The concept of <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> was first proposed in 1951 by the hematologist William Dameshek. In the most recent World Health Organization classification of hematologic malignancies, this group of diseases was renamed from [...] "myeloproliferative diseases" [...] to [...] "myeloproliferative neoplasms". This reflects the underlying clonal genetic changes that are a salient feature of this group of disease.|$|E
5000|$|Primary polycythemias are due {{to factors}} {{intrinsic}} to red cell precursors. Polycythemia vera (PCV), polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), or erythremia, occurs when excess red blood cells are produced {{as a result of}} an abnormality of the bone marrow. [...] Often, excess white blood cells and platelets are also produced. Polycythemia vera is classified as a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> Symptoms include headaches and vertigo, and signs on physical examination include an abnormally enlarged spleen and/or liver. In some cases, affected individuals may have associated conditions including high blood pressure or formation of blood clots. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment. A hallmark of polycythemia is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct > 55% seen in 83% of cases. A somatic (non-hereditary) mutation (V617F) in the JAK2 gene is found in 95% of cases, though also present in other myeloproliferative disorders.|$|E

50|$|It {{also has}} {{activity}} against cells expressing JAK2(V617F), a mutated {{form of the}} janus kinase 2 (JAK2) enzyme that is implicated in the pathophysiology of many <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases,</b> including polycythaemia vera.

50|$|In humans, {{genetic linkage}} analyses, {{genome-wide}} association studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variation surveys, and mutation screenings found the human chromosomal 12q24 locus, with the SH2B3 gene at its core, {{to be associated}} with an exceptionally wide spectrum of disease susceptibilities. For example, hematopoietic traits of red and white blood cells (like erythrocytosis and <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease),</b> autoimmune disorders, and vascular pathology have been reported. Moreover, co-expression of the interleukin-7 receptor together with LNK was carefully studied, and it was concluded that interleukin-7 receptor expression was significantly more highly expressed than LNK in B-cell acute leukemic lymphoma. This observation distinguished a novel subset of high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma with a potential therapy targeting the interleukin-7 signaling pathway. Another study indicated that LNK can suppress the interleukin-7/JAK/STAT signaling pathway to restrict pre B-cell progenitor expansion and leukemia development, which provided a pathogenic mechanism and a potential therapeutic approach for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with SH2B3 gene mutations.|$|E

50|$|Hematological {{malignancies}} may {{derive from}} {{either of the}} two major blood cell lineages: myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. The myeloid cell line normally produces granulocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, macrophages and mast cells; the lymphoid cell line produces B, T, NK and plasma cells. Lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, and myeloma are from the lymphoid line, while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> are myeloid in origin.|$|R
40|$|Background A small {{proportion}} of patients with chronic <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> have constitutive activation of the gene for platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. The gene is located on chromosome 5 q 33, and the activation is usually caused by a t(5; 12) (q 33;p 13) translocation associated with an ETV 6 -PDGFRB fusion gene. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate specifically inhibits ABL, PDGFR, and KIT kinases and has impressive clinical efficacy in BCR-ABL–positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Methods We treated four patients who had chronic <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> and chromosomal translocations involving 5 q 33 with imatinib mesylate (400 mg daily). Three of the four patients presented with leukocytosis and eosinophilia; their leukemia cells carried the ETV 6 -PDGFRB fusion gene. The fourth patient had leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and a t(5; 12) translocation involving PDGFRB and an unknown partner gene; he also had extensive raised, ulcerated skin lesions that had been present for a long time. Results In all four patients, a normal blood count was achieved within four weeks after treatment began. In the patient with skin disease, the lesions began to resolve shortly after treatment began. The t(5; 12) translocation was undetectable by 12 weeks in three patients and by 36 weeks in the fourth patient. In the three patients with the ETV 6 -PDGFRB fusion gene, the transcript level decreased, and in one patient, it became undetectable by 36 weeks. All responses were durable at 9 to 12 months of follow-up. Conclusions Imatinib mesylate induces durable responses in patients with chronic <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> associated with activation of PDGFRB. <br/...|$|R
