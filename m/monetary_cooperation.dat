25|$|Never {{before had}} {{international}} <b>monetary</b> <b>cooperation</b> been attempted {{on a permanent}} institutional basis. Even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments, not on a one-state one-vote basis, but rather in proportion to quotas. Since the United States was contributing the most, U.S. leadership was the key. Under the system of weighted voting, the United States exerted a preponderant influence on the IMF. The United States held one-third of all IMF quotas at the outset, enough on its own to veto all changes to the IMF Charter.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of the Comorian franc is founded on tight monetary and credit discipline, underpinned by two specific safeguard measures: the central bank is required to maintain 20% foreign-exchange cover of its sight liabilities, {{and the government is}} not allowed to draw more than 20% of the previous year's budget receipts from their central bank funds. The ministers of finance of the franc area (France, the CFA zone and Comoros) meet biannually. The agreement between France and the Comoros is essentially the same as the agreement France has with the CFA Zone. It is a continuation of a relationship of <b>monetary</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the two countries that has existed for more than a century.|$|E
40|$|How should <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> be {{designed}} {{when more than}} one country is simultaneously facing zero lower bounds on nominal interest rates? To answer this question, we examine <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> with both optimal discretion and commitment policies in a two-country model. We reach the following conclusions. Under discretion, <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> {{is characterized by the}} intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES), a key parameter measuring international spillovers, and no history dependency. On the other hand, under commitment, monetary policy features history dependence with international spillover effects. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{wide variety}} of {{international}} macroeconomic models <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> is optimal, non-cooperative policies are inefficient, but optimal policies can be attained non-cooperatively by optimal design of domestic institutions/contracts. We show that given endogenous institutional design, inefficiencies of non-cooperation cannot and will not be eliminated. We model the delegation stage explicitly and show that subgame perfect, credible contracts (chosen by governments based on individual rationality) are non-zero, but are different from optimal contracts and hence lead to inefficient equilibria. Optimal contracts require cooperation at the delegation stage, which is inconsistent with the advocated non-cooperative nature of the solution. A general solution method for credible contracts and an example from international <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> are considered. Our results feature delegation as an equilibrium phenomenon, explain inefficiencies of existing delegation schemes and hint to a potentially stronger role for supranational authorities in international policy coordination.

40|$|The {{question}} {{explored in}} this paper is whether the EMS can continue to perform efficiently and ensure low inflation in an economically and financially integrated area {{with a high degree}} of currency substitution. A dilemma may arise: on the one hand, currency substitution should be accommodated to provide market participants with the currency they desire; on the other, currency substitution should not determine an excess of liquidity in the system leading to inflation. These objectives might be difficult to reconcile in a system with decentralized asymmetric <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> such as the EMS and might have adverse consequences for the monetary stability of the system.

40|$|Until recently, {{not much}} {{attention}} {{had been paid}} to the need to promote regional <b>monetary</b> and financial <b>cooperation.</b> This is surprising as cooperation in finance provides more opportunities for "win-win" situations. However, the pace of <b>monetary</b> and financial <b>cooperation</b> has picked up in the postcrisis period. Countries in East Asia appear to have mustered a certain amount of "political will" to propel the process further. Cooperation has ranged from information exchange and surveillance, to establishing regional financing facilities and early warning systems. Beyond the Chiang Mai Initiative, efforts are also under way to coordinate macroeconomic and exchange rate policies mainly under the ASEAN Task Force on ASEAN Currency and Exchange Rate Mechanism of the AsiaEurope Finance Ministers group.

2500|$|However, the {{implementation}} of Phase 1 [...] was put on hold in 1993 {{as a result of}} Trinidad and Tobago floating its dollar.

2500|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an {{international}} organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., of [...] "189 countries working to foster global <b>monetary</b> <b>cooperation,</b> secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world."

2500|$|On 23 November 1979, the {{government}} of Comoros signed the Accord de coopération monétaire entre la République Française et la République fédérale islamique des Comores, a <b>monetary</b> <b>cooperation</b> agreement with France, making Comoros part of the franc zone (but {{not part of the}} CFA franc zone). This agreement provided {{for the establishment of a}} system of fixed parity between the French franc and the Comorian franc and free convertibility between the two currencies, guaranteed by the Comorian central bank's opening of an operations account (compte d'operation) at the French Treasury (Trésor public) to handle all exchange transactions. Sixty-five percent of the foreign exchange reserves of Comoros are held in euros in this account. This account is similar to overnight deposits with the French Treasury: [...] it may bear interest and may, in special circumstances, post a negative balance. However, to prevent this account from showing a lasting overdraft, a number of preventative measures have been set up.|$|E
2500|$|The aim {{of forming}} a CARICOM {{monetary}} union is not new. As {{a precursor to}} this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour {{the use of the}} member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and <b>monetary</b> <b>cooperation</b> between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the main features of optimal <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> within a micro-founded macroeconometric framework. First, using Bayesian techniques, we estimate a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for the United States (US) and the euro area (EA). The main features of the new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM) are embodied in our framework: in particular, imperfect exchange rate pass-through and incomplete financial markets internationally. Each country model incorporates the wide range of nominal and real frictions found in the closed-economy literature: staggered price and wage settings, variable capital utilization and fixed costs in production. Then, using the estimated parameters and disturbances, we study the properties of the optimal <b>monetary</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> through welfare analysis, impulse responses and variance decompositions.

Nevertheless, the gains appear {{to be sensitive to the}} degree of openness and further economic integration between the two regions could generate sizable gains from cooperation. For example, increasing the trade shares to 32 percent of GDP in both regions, the gains from cooperation rise to about 1 percent of steady-state consumption.
