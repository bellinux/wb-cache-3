5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators.

5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|After a fourteen-year hiatus, Antrim and Cork renewed their rivalry on 25 July 2004. Antrim manager Dinny Cahill {{made some}} strong {{comments}} in the media prior to the game in which he criticised Cork players Brian Corcoran, Niall McCarthy, Tom Kenny and Jerry O'Connor. Right from the throw-in the Cork tempo was furious. Corcoran goaled twice for Cork {{to give them a}} commanding 2-13 to 0-3 interval lead. Antrim came close to scoring a goal when a Liam Watson-struck free hit the bottom of the upright in the 60th <b>minute</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when Cork had extended their lead to sixteen points before eventually winning by 2-20 to 0-10.|$|R
25|$|Elephants, {{have shown}} unusual {{behavior}} upon encountering {{the remains of}} another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it {{for long periods of}} time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot. He tried to solve the first problem by buying an engine built by the recently founded Miller company of Turin; the engine wasn't expensive and the Trentine engineer was glad to use an Italian-built piece of technology, because of his irredentist sentiments; however, the four-cylinder W engine proved quite unreliable and was apparently unable to run smoothly {{for more than a}} few <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> As far as the second problem was concerned, Caproni decided to have Ugo Tabacchi, a Veronese-born Trentine chaffeur who had recently joined Caproni's team, pilot the maiden flight of his aircraft. Although some licensed pilots (mostly trained on Wright aircraft) were already available in Italy, Caproni couldn't afford to hire any of them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E
50|$|The {{one race}} {{against the clock}} for the 2010 Tour took place in Los Angeles, on a longer course than was used in Solvang in the {{previous}} three editions of the race. It ran twenty miles over two laps in downtown Los Angeles. The course passed such landmarks as the Millennium Biltmore Hotel, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, and Los Angeles City Hall, finishing at Chick Hearn Court at L.A. Live. It was expected that the riders complete the course in anywhere from 41 to 48 minutes. The first 90 riders to take the course were staggered one <b>minute</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and the final 30 spaced out with two minutes separating their departures.|$|R

60|$|So {{the long}} night wore on--Muriel pillowed on loose cocoanut husk, dozing now and again, and waking {{with a start}} to gaze round about her wildly, and realize once more in what plight she found herself; Felix {{crouching}} by her feet, and keeping watch with eager eyes and ears on every side for the least sign of a noiseless, naked footfall through the tangled growth of that dense tropical under-bush. Time after time he clapped {{his hand to his}} ear, shell-wise, and listened and peered, with knitted brow, suspecting some sudden swoop from an ambush in the jungle of creepers behind the little plantain patch. Time after time he grasped his knife hard, and puckered his eyebrows resolutely, and stood still with bated breath for a fierce, wild leap upon his fancied assailant. But the night wore away by degrees, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and no man came; and dawn began to brighten the sea-line to eastward.|$|R
25|$|Mammals have wide {{diversity}} in sleep phenomena. Generally, {{they go through}} periods of alternating non-REM and REM sleep, but these manifest differently. Horses and other herbivorous ungulates can sleep while standing, but must necessarily lie down for REM sleep (which causes muscular atony) for short periods. Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep for a few <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Bats sleep while hanging upside down. Inversely to humans and rats, male armadillos get erections during non-REM sleep. Early mammals engaged in polyphasic sleep, dividing sleep into multiple bouts per day. Higher daily sleep quotas and shorter sleep cycles in polyphasic species as compared to monophasic species, suggest that polyphasic sleep may be a less efficient means of attaining sleep’s benefits. Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns. It follows that the evolution of monophasic sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR.|$|E
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E
25|$|Battle Action Tanks: This {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular rides at Motorworld, and it was {{featured}} prominently in the television ads. In a chainlink fence-enclosed area, small tanks could be driven around, for a fee, for five <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a sensor prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other tankers often took advantage of the delay to pepper the stricken vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also join in the fun through less costly cannons mounted on the inside of the fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which usually happened several times a day, they were often pelted with tennis balls from every direction despite prohibitions against such behavior that could result in expulsion from the park. This gave the tank ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the patrons, making it the least popular place to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2012, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.|$|E
60|$|TUESDAY {{afternoon}} came, and waned to the twilight. The {{village of}} St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children {{had not been}} found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations, {{saying that it was}} plain the children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious.

5000|$|Among their {{advantages}} over the competition, they were {{played with a}} so-called [...] "permanent" [...] precisely shaped diamond stylus, while lateral-cut records were played with a ten-for-a-penny steel needle that quickly wore to fit the groove contour and {{was meant to be}} replaced after one use. A feed screw mechanism inside the player moved the reproducer across the record at the required rate, relieving the groove of that work and thus reducing record wear. The playing speed for Diamond Discs was specified at exactly 80 revolutions per <b>minute,</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when other makers' recording speeds had not been standardized and could be as slow as 70 rpm or even faster than 80 rpm, but were typically somewhere around 76 rpm, leaving users who cared about correct pitch to adjust the playback speed for each record until it [...] "sounded right". Above all, there was, and still is, general agreement that the Diamond Disc system produced the clearest, most [...] "present" [...] sound of any non-electronic disc recording technology.|$|R
60|$|The next {{sound that}} came to me was audible in my room; audible sometimes, close at my pillow. It was the {{simplest}} sound imaginable--nothing but the soft rustling of a woman's dress. And yet, I heard in it innumerable harmonies, sweet changes, and pauses minute beyond all definition. I could only open my eyes for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and even then, could not fix them steadily on anything; but I knew that the rustling dress was Clara's; and fresh sensations seemed to throng upon me, as I listened to the sound which {{told me that she}} was in the room. I felt the soft summer air on my face; I enjoyed the sweet scent of flowers, wafted on that air; and once, when my door was left open for a moment, the twittering of birds in the aviary down stairs, rang with exquisite clearness and sweetness on my ear. It was thus that my faculties strengthened, hour by hour, always in the same gradual way, from the time when I first heard the footstep and the whisper outside my chamber-door.|$|R
25|$|Cetacean {{surfacing}} behaviour is a {{group of}} behaviours demonstrated by the Cetacea infraorder when they come to the water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive, and some species have been known to dive for up to 85 <b>minutes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when hunting. In addition to respiration, cetaceans have developed and used surface behaviours for many other functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order Cetacea, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. Cetacea is usually split into two suborders, Odontoceti and Mysticeti, based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, Cetacea can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all Odontocetes less than 10 m long including orca) as many behaviours are correlated with size. Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular tourism industry.|$|E

After having wiped his forehead, as already described, he set himself steadily to fulfil the duties of his situation. These were not so simple as one might suppose, for, as had been explained to him by Jackman, he had to watch two passes--one close above his post, the other close below it--either of which might bring the deer within easy reach of his rifle, but {{of course there was}} the uncertainty as to which of the two passes the deer would choose. As it was a physical impossibility to have his eyes on both passes at once, the old gentleman soon found that turning his head every few seconds {{from one side to the}} other became irksome. Then it became painful.

A lurking rage against {{the woman who had}} so entrapped him and avenged herself was always there; crude and misshapen schemes of retaliation upon her, floated in his brain; but nothing was distinct. A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts. Even while he was so busy with this fevered, ineffectual thinking, his one constant idea was, that he would postpone reflection until some indefinite time.|$|R
