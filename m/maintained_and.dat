5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly <b>maintained</b> <b>and</b> upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and <b>maintained,</b> <b>and</b> arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been <b>maintained</b> <b>and</b> the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|From 1357 onwards parliaments {{began to}} be {{referred}} to as the Three Estates, adopting the language of social organisation that had developed in France in the eleventh century. It was composed of the clergy, nobles and burgesses, (those that pray, those that fight and those that work). This marked the adoption of a commonplace view of Medieval society as composed of distinct orders. Within these estates there were ranks for which the terminology was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel that used in England. This consciousness over status was reflected in military and (from 1430) sumptuary legislation, which set out the types of weapons and armour that should be <b>maintained,</b> <b>and</b> clothes that could be worn, by various ranks.|$|E
5|$|I Want You {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album <b>maintained</b> <b>and</b> expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E

5|$|In 1360 {{the king}} {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} Southampton's defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to examine how best to improve them.

The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line.|$|E
5|$|In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the {{retained}} engine house, boiler house, chimney {{and steam}} engine of Ellenroad Mill, a former 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet.

The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning.|$|E
