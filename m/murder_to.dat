5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E

5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} apartment building {{after getting a}} tip, and sees a figure bolt {{out of one of}} the rooms during the night. He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
5|$|In a {{fifth and}} final case, (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy Advance release, but added for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in a case where the body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E

However, Black is soon called to {{investigate}} {{the body of a}} woman at a dog pound in Portland, Oregon. Black works for the Millennium Group, an organisation which offers private investigation services and consults with law enforcement on certain types of cases. He is asked by Group member Jim Penseyres (Chris Ellis) to help a local detective on the murder case, as he is being considered as prospective member of the Millennium Group. Black believes the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> be the work of a serial killer, and is convinced there will be a message from him on the bodies.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E

5|$|Steve becomes {{paranoid}} that Charlie will {{steal the}} gold, {{and starts to}} launder it faster, but he is forced to kill Yevhen when he reveals {{his knowledge of the}} Venice heist. Yevhen's death infuriates Mashkov, his cousin and a leading member of an Ukrainian crime family. Mashkov connects the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> Charlie through Skinny Pete. Further uneased, Steve makes plans to transport the gold to Mexico City by a private plane from Los Angeles International Airport after transporting it there in an armored car. Napster overhears of this, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E

5|$|The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety {{is a law}} {{enforcement}} agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history {{and some of the}} best-known criminal cases {{in the history of the}} Old West.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised {{public awareness of}} the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to an investigation of the London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the <b>murder</b> <b>to</b> the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
