40|$|Abstract: THORNHILL and THORNHILL {{posited that}} sexual assault inflicts greater fitness costs {{on women in}} {{committed}} long-term heterosexual relationships than on women not in such relation-ships because the former face the added risk of decreased investment by their partners. In a series of papers (1990 a, 1990 b, 1990 c, and 1991), THORNHILL and THORNHILL reported support for what we term the Relationship Status Hypothesis (RSH) using data on the psychological sequelae of rape. Here, we reexamine the RSH in light of THORNHILL and THORNHILL’S original findings and the relevant literature. Identifying limitations of the original work and finding little support for the RSH in other published work, we then test the RSH in two studies using prospective fear of rape as a dependent measure; again, we find no support for the hypothesis. We conclude that, although <b>marital</b> discord following <b>rape</b> {{is an important issue}} warranting further study, the Relationship Status Hypothesis has limited empirical support at present...|$|R

Incidences of rape are classified into a number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault. These include date rape, gang rape, <b>marital</b> <b>rape,</b> incestual rape, child sexual abuse, prison rape, acquaintance rape, war rape and statutory rape. Forced sexual activity can be committed over a long period of time with little to no physical injury.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the origins}} of the concept of a <b>marital</b> {{exemption}} from <b>rape</b> laws (a rule that a husband cannot be charged with the rape of his wife) is the idea that by marriage a woman gives irrevocable consent for her husband to have sex with her any time he demands it. This view was described by Sir Matthew Hale, in History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736), where he wrote that the wife [...] "hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract." [...] Also, American and English law subscribed until the 20th century to the system of coverture, that is, a legal doctrine under which, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband. Given that a wife had no legal standing of her own, and the understanding was that she was the property of her husband, she had no legal right to claim rape by her husband (Bergen, 2016). In the US, the wife's legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of Kirchberg v. Feenstra, , a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional. English common law also had a great impact on many legal systems of the world through colonialism. (Bovarnik, 2007).|$|R

5000|$|In {{the present}} case, the trial judge, when rejecting the applicant's {{submission}} that marital immunity applied, doubted {{the extent to}} which it could ever have been permissible under the common law for a husband to beat his wife into having sexual intercourse with him The Commission considers that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged <b>marital</b> immunity for <b>rape.</b> As stated by the Court of Appeal in the applicant's case, lip service had been paid to the alleged general rule while the courts at the same time increased the number of exceptions. That there was uncertainty as to the width of the exceptions is apparent from the Law Commission Working Paper examining the question ....While there was no express authority for the proposition that an implied agreement of separation between husband or wife or unilateral withdrawal of consent by the wife would bring a case outside the marital immunity, the Commission takes the view that in the present case where the applicant's wife had withdrawn from cohabitation and there was de facto separation with the expressed intention of both to seek a divorce, there was a basis on which it could be anticipated that the courts could hold that the notional consent of the wife was no longer to be implied The Commission considers that this adaptation in the application of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable to an applicant with appropriate legal advice.|$|R
40|$|Rape {{constitutes}} the most underreported {{crime in the}} U. S., particularly among Asian American women. Unreported rapes impede intervention, victim support, and the social recognition and information necessary for policy-making. Concerning these problems, this dissertation explored ethnic and gendered impediments to rape disclosure that were expressed in Korean American women 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning about rape. Data for the study were collected from interviews and surveys with 250 Korean American women in northeastern Connecticut and New York City. Data collection was conducted between 1994 and 2000. ^ The {{data suggest that the}} women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>marital</b> concerns in <b>rape</b> and rape disclosure impede their intentions to report potential rape incidents that they might experience. Their marital concerns include concerns over decreasing marriage prospects and potential dysfunction or dissolution of marriage. These concerns reflect masculine ideals of female sexuality and life emphasizing untainted virginity, its value for marriage prospects, and the importance of monogamous marriage partnership for the security of a woman 2 ̆ 7 s social status and value and quality of life. Confucianism; Christian beliefs; co-ethnic-, male- and family-oriented marriage; women 2 ̆ 7 s class and ethnic minority statuses constitute ideological, institutional, and material conditions enforcing the masculine ideals of female sexuality and life. ^ These findings suggest that future study and practical efforts for rape victims {{need to be aware of}} a victim 2 ̆ 7 s culturally embedded concerns about rape. Specifically, they need to be aware of the gendered prescriptions of ideal female sexuality and life, as well as broader cultural circumstances in which these prescriptions are situated. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Soc Sci (Clinical Psychology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 This study {{investigated}} the psychological effects and coping strategies of women who were raped in the Gauteng province. The study aimed to dete 1 mine the effects that rape has on the victims and to determine the coping strategies that the victims employ {{to deal with their}} ordeal. Using a quantitative methodology the study was conducted among I 00 female rape victims that were sampled from selected rape crisis centres in the Gauteng province. The researcher used the Trauma Symptom CheckJ ist (TSC- 40), as well as the Coping Strategies Inventory Short Form (CS I-SF) which are both standardised and validated instruments. The responses of the participants were analysed to determine which of them were more traumatised than others. To come to the conclusion of who was more traumatised than the other, a comparison of the rating of the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC) was done and consideration of all questions was taken. It was then dete 1 mined how the more traumatised and the less traumatised used the coping strategies to deal with the negative emotions due to rape. This was done by analysing the coping strategies of each participant according to how they responded on each question on the Coping Strategies Inventory (SF). Using means, standard deviations and regression analysis, the results revealed that a high number of rape victims had higher levels of trauma. This was indicated by their high scores on the dissociation, anxiety, depression, sexual abuse trauma index, sleep disturbance and sexual problems subscales of the TSC. Higher percentages of those, rarely engaged in problem focused coping and resorted to emotion focused coping instead. Those who had less trauma were found to be engaging more in problem focused coping. The victims that had less trauma were found to be communicating effectively with other people and were engaging in positive thinking. Those who had high levels of trauma were found to be not interacting effectively with people in their immediate environment which may have influenced their emotion focused coping strategies. The results also revealed that emotional reactions and coping strategies are not affected by age and <b>marital</b> status of <b>rape</b> victims. Master...|$|R
