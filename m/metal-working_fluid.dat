40|$|The {{distribution}} of Acinetobacter species among the bacteria isolated from an unusually heavily contaminated petroleum-based water-soluble <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid</b> {{used in a}} large North American automotive machining operation was investigated. It had been found previously 1 that, in laboratory cultures with metal-working fluids as the sole carbon source, these species grew more rapidly and to much higher densities than any other types of bacteria isolated from this system. Thus, {{it was expected that}} they would dominate the population and would be difficult to control. It is shown here that, contrary to expectation, over a one-year period Acinetobacter species usually accounted for only a few percent of the total population. Factory fluids did not contain substances that selectively inhibited the growth of these species. In mixed-cultures grown in the laboratory with <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid</b> as the carbon source, Acinetobacter species accounted for less than 1 % in the initial inocolum, nearly 70 % during the mid-exponential-phase, and only a few percent in the stationary-phase. These experiments suggest, as a working hypothesis, that the Acinetobacter species `govern' the contamination {{in the sense that they}} first colonize the fluid and their presence is necessary to maintain the other strains...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Metal-working</b> <b>fluids</b> contain complex {{mixtures}} of chemicals and metal workers constitute a potential risk {{group for the}} development of allergic contact dermatitis. Case presentation Two metal workers developed allergic contact dermatitis on the hands and lower arms from exposure to a neat oil used in metal processing. Patch testing revealed that the relevant contact allergen was a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(oxiranylmethyl) ester, added to the oil as a stabilizer. None of the patients had positive reactions to the bisphenol A-based epoxy resin in the standard series. Conclusions These cases emphasize that well-known contact allergens may show up from unexpected sources of exposure. Further, it can be a long-lasting, laborious process to detect an occupational contact allergen and cooperation from the patient and the manufacturer of the sensitizing product is essential. </p...|$|R
40|$|The metal fmishing {{industry}} uses over 40 {{production processes}} {{to produce a}} wide range of metal products. Waste streams generated include wastewater, waste oils, spent solvents, and spent process solutions. Current 1,v a wide variety of techniques which minimize waste are available. Cost-effective methods to reduce electroplating wastewater contamination include water conserv&ion and drag-out reduction, recovery and management. Ways to cost-effectively reduce the generation of spent <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluids</b> include establishing a fluid management program and installing a fluid recovery system. However, before any techniques are selected, a waste reduction survey should fmt be conducted. The metal finishing industry incorporates {{a wide range of}} products and production processes. Finished products range from paper clips to components of the space shuttle. The operations performed at metal finishing facilities usually begin with material in the form of raw stock, such as rods, bars, sheets, and castings, and can progress to the most sophisticated surface finishing operations. This can include painting, electroplating, machining, and anodizing. Standard industrial categories in the metal finishing industry include...|$|R
40|$|VOSOLUB {{project is}} a {{demonstration}} project supported by Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME) that aims at testing under real operating conditions new formulations of sunflower-based biolubricants with high oleic acid content. These biolubricant formulations (including hydraulic fluids, greases, and neat oil <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluids)</b> will be tested in three European demonstrating sites. Their technical performance will be evaluated and compared to corresponding mineral lubricants ones. In order to cover the demand for the sunflower base oil, a European SMEs network will be established to ensure the supply of the base at a competitive market price. Results presented concerns the base oil quality confirmed to be {{in accordance with the}} specification required, in particular on Free Fatty acid content, Phosphorus content, rancimat induction time and oleic acid content (ITERG). The oil characteristics specific for lubricant application analyzed by BfB Oil Research under normalized methods, match with lubricant specifications requirement such as viscosity, cold & hot properties, surface properties, anti-oxidant properties and thermal stability, anti-wear and EP properties, anti-corrosion properties Performance of the new biolubricant have been assessed by formulators and TEKNIKER First results on the use of new lubricant on real condition for rail Grease (produced by RS CLARE and tested with Sheffield Supertram), Hydraulic oil (produced by BRUGAROLAS) and cutting oil (produced by MOTUL TECH and tested with innovative machining, turning) are described...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 24 {{bacterial}} isolates {{able to grow}} on metal-working fluids were obtained from soil or metal-working fluids (both in-use and heavily contaminated fluids). Pure cultures of the isolates were tested {{for their ability to}} degrade a selection of components, including berate esters, phosphate ester, biocide and triethanolamine, typically found in synthetic metal-working fluids. All components, when present at a level equivalent to half that found in an in-use <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid,</b> supported growth when utilised as the sole source of carbon and/or nitrogen.

40|$|BACKGROUND Occupational asthma {{commonly}} {{results in}} work-related changes in serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements. Whether alveolitis {{can result in}} similar changes is unknown. AIMS To identify differences and similarities of serial PEF between workers with occupational alveolitis and asthma seen during an outbreak investigation in a factory with <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid</b> exposure. METHODS Workers with respiratory symptoms and rest-day improvement were identified by questionnaire. Each was asked to measure PEF 8 times daily for 4 weeks at home and work. Alveolitis was subsequently diagnosed from a validated scoring system including radiological changes, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy results. Occupational asthma was confirmed with a positive Oasys score > 2. 5 and a mean rest-work PEF > 16 l/min from serial 2 -hourly PEF measurements. The Oasys PEF plotter calculated differences between rest and workdays for mean PEF, diurnal variation and the scores were used to confirm an occupational effect (Oasys, area between curve and time point). Records were compared between the alveolitis group and the group with occupational asthma without alveolitis. RESULTS Forty workers with occupational asthma and 16 with alveolitis had indistinguishable PEF changes on workdays in terms of magnitude (median reduction 18. 5 and 16. 1 l/min, respectively) and diurnal variation. Immediate reactions were more common with occupational asthma and late reactions more common with alveolitis. CONCLUSIONS PEF responses to <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid</b> aerosols do not distinguish occupational asthma from alveolitis except in timing. They {{can be used to}} identify the workplace as the cause of asthma and also alveolitis...|$|E

Overall incidence has not declined, but recognition {{of the problem and}} substitutions have resulted in dramatic reductions in some causes of occupational asthma, particularly latex and glutaraldehyde in healthcare workers. Newer at risk workers include cleaners and those exposed to <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid.</b> Standards of care have now been published, supported by evidence- based reviews of the literature, which are likely to require referral to centres specialising in occupational asthma for compliance. The spectrum of occupational asthma is expanding, with low-dose irritant mechanisms likely to account for some occupational asthma with latency. Eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic phenotypes are also seen, the non-eosinophilic variant having more normal non-specific responsiveness than the eosinophilic subgroup. Physiological confirmation of occupational asthma is required but remains challenging. Specific challenges may be negative in workers confirmed as having occupational asthma from workplace challenges. Serial measurements of peak expiratory flow or FEV 1 are feasible in the occupational health and general respiratory clinic settings and provide a method of validation of occupational asthma in those without ready access to specific challenge testing, while minimum data quantity standards are now established which need to be achieved for optimal sensitivity/specificity. New developments in the analysis of serial mea-surements of peak expiratory flow comparing the mean hourly values on work and rest days have shown good specificity and sensitivity from shorter records (but more frequent readings) than needed for the standard Oasys score...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of microbial growth in <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluids</b> (MWF) {{and the effect}} of the addition of biocides were studied in large fluid systems, in this case, one central tank which holds 150 m 3. In this system, populations of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes (greater than 10 (8) CFU/ml) were sustained for a year, although large quantities of biocides were added. Quantitation of 3 -OH lauric acid, a marker for many Pseudomonas spp., by gas chromatography indicated that the bacterial biomass exceeded the viable counts by approximately 15 times. Fungi were grown on several occasions, the dominating genera being Fusarium and Candida. Soon after the old MWF was removed and the tank was provided with fresh MWF, which consisted of an emulsion of mineral oil in water, there was a massive growth of P. pseudoalcaligenes that reached levels of greater than 10 (8) bacteria per ml. Initially, only low concentrations of other species were found for some weeks. After this period, different enterobacteria and other gram-negative rods often appeared at high concentrations (10 (7) and 10 (8) bacteria per ml, respectively). Bacteria identified as P. pseudoalcaligenes showed great variation with respect to colony morphology and a certain heterogeneity with respect to biochemical characteristics. Certain bacterial species grew as microcolonies on metal strips immersed in the circulating MWF, but P. pseudoalcaligenes was not recovered from this habitat. The total bacterial count in the air surrounding the machines in the metal-working shop showed an inverse relation to increasing distance from the machine. The concentration of bacteria in the air varied {{because of the number of}} machines in use, temperature, and humidity. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Water-based metal-working fluids used in {{large-scale}} {{industrial operations}} consist of many components, {{but in the}} most commonly used formulations only three classes of components are present in high enough concentrations that they could, in principle, provide enough carbon to support the high bacterial densities (109 CFU/ml) often observed in contaminated factory fluids. These components are petroleum oil (1 to 5 %), petroleum sulfonates (0. 1 to 0. 5 %), and fatty acids (less than 0. 1 %, mainly linoleic and oleic acids supplied as tall oils). We isolated pure strains of predominating bacteria from contaminated reservoirs of two metal-working systems and randomly selected 12 strains which we tested in liquid culture for growth with each of the <b>metal-working</b> <b>fluid</b> components as the sole source of carbon. Of the 12 strains, 7 reached high density (109 CFU/ml from an initial inoculum of less than 2 × 103) in 24 h, and 1 strain did the same in 48 h with 0. 05 % oleic or linoleic acid as the carbon source. These same strains also grew on 1 % naphthenic petroleum oil but required up to 72 h to reach densities near 108 CFU/ml. One strain grew slightly and the others not at all on the petroleum sulfonates. The four remaining strains did not grow on any of the components, even though they were among the predominating bacteria in the contaminated system. Of the seven strains that grew best on the fatty acids and on the naphthenic petroleum oil, five were tentatively identified as Acinetobacter species and two were identified as Pseudomonas species. Four of the bacteria that did not grow were tentatively identified as species of Pseudomonas, and one could not be identified...|$|E
