On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports.

5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution.</b> Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee.

40|$|The authors study brand-share {{dynamics}} among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, {{market shares}} are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can {{take into account}} the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's <b>market</b> share <b>and</b> its <b>distribution</b> over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's <b>market</b> share <b>and</b> <b>distribution,</b> is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled <b>market</b> share <b>and</b> <b>distribution.</b> Empirical results using data from the U. S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between <b>market</b> share <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early {{in the life of the}} new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in <b>market</b> share <b>and</b> <b>distribution.</b> Later, such momentum appears absent, In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market...|$|R
