5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for The Kindly Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was going out of business.|$|E

5|$|In the inter-war period, Sleaford's {{population}} remained static, but the Great Depression in the 1930s caused unemployment to rise. Council-housing developments along Drove Lane proved {{insufficient to}} house low-income families after the Westgate slums were cleared in the 1930s so Jubilee Grove opened in that decade to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> In the post-war period, there were new housing developments at St Giles Avenue, the Hoplands, Russell Crescent, Jubilee Grove and Grantham Road. Parts {{of the town}} were redeveloped: in 1958, the Bristol Arms Arcade opened, the Corn Exchange was demolished in the 1960s and the Waterside Shopping Precinct opened in 1973, as did Flaxwell House, designed to house a department store, though later becoming the national headquarters for Interflora.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E

5|$|Shaw's first box-office {{success was}} Arms and the Man (1894), a mock-Ruritanian comedy satirising {{conventions}} of love, military honour and class. The press found the play overlong, and accused Shaw of mediocrity, sneering at heroism and patriotism, heartless cleverness, and copying W.S.Gilbert's style. The public {{took a different}} view, and {{the management of the}} theatre staged extra matinée performances to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> The play ran from April to July, toured the provinces and was staged in New York. Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr, with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894, much resented by Jenny Patterson.|$|E
5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted agile, responsive, impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, resilient mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling these demands led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier Nonius.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{issue of}} Shonen Jump sold over 300,000 copies, far {{exceeding}} Viz's expected 100,000 copies {{and making it}} one of the top comic titles in 2002. The first printing of 250,000 copies was sold out before the issue was released, and two additional printings were necessary to fully <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> After the initial launch, the magazine had an average monthly circulation of 190,000, but it quickly grew to 205,000 by its first anniversary. The August 2003 issue, which included a demo version of an upcoming Yu-Gi-Oh! PC game, was the top issue with 540,000 copies sold. As of 2008, the magazine has a circulation of 215,000, with subscriptions constituting 54% of the copies distributed.|$|E
5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, in the {{years prior to the}} war basic defence industries had been established in Australia for the production of uniforms, webbing, boots, small arms and explosives and ammunition. Despite this, the majority of the equipment initially issued came from British Army stocks until Australian production was able to be increased to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> that resulted from rapid military expansion {{at the start of the}} war. These included such items as heliographs, water bottles, bits, stirrups, spurs and shovels, although saddlery and harnesses were provided by a local government manufacturer. Although Australia had a relatively limited industrial base during the war, it was ultimately able to supply the majority of the Army's more simple requirements; however, the remainder of the more complex equipment had to be purchased from suppliers in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Utilities {{and other}} {{services}} also have significantly changed since 1990. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was renovated and expanded in 1976, 1985, 1995, and 2000. In 2009, the hospital opened a new heart care center during its latest expansion. Bassett Army Hospital on Fort Wainwright went through a $132 million renovation in 2005. To <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for a convention center and large sporting arena, the city paid for construction of the Carlson Center, a 5,000-seat arena that opened in 1990. In 1996, the city of Fairbanks privatized its utilities when the Municipal Utilities Service was sold to a private company. About $74 million from the sale was deposited into a savings account called the Fairbanks Permanent Fund, which was invested and managed in a fashion similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, though residents do not receive any income from the Fairbanks Permanent Fund.|$|E

5|$|Despite this {{emerging}} competition, natural ice remained vital to North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to continue to expand. Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along the Hudson River and Maine alone, the Hudson having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River in Maine to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand,</b> and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 saw another ice famine hit the east: the Hudson harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations in Maine, where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E
5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E

5|$|Poole {{established}} successful commerce {{with the}} North American colonies in the 16th century, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland. Trade with Newfoundland grew steadily to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for {{fish from the}} Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade followed a three-cornered route; ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions, then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine, olive oil, and salt. By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole's merchants. This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town {{where many of the}} medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing. The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain's monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole's merchants at a lower cost. Poole's Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Fe {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of armor}} {{available}} {{was also a}} serious issue of the UNC. In order to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand,</b> a variety of armored old platforms were hastily rebuilt and modified for movement into the Pusan Perimeter. M4A3 Sherman medium tanks (preferably the most advanced model, the M4A3E8 (76)W HVSS Sherman) from World War II were pulled from stocks and rebuilt for use in Korea. M15A1 Half-tracks were also rebuilt and modified for use in Korea. During early engagements, the M24 Chaffee light tank was the primary armored vehicle used by the Americans because it was most readily available and most combat-ready; nevertheless, it performed poorly against heavier North Korean armor. All of these weapons {{had been used in}} World War II and were considered in poor condition. The appearance of the North Korean T-34 tanks forced the US to move large numbers of heavier, more powerful tanks into the battle. During August, six tank battalions, with around 69 tanks each, arrived at Pusan. By {{the end of the month}} there were more than 500 UN tanks assembled there. Most were M4A3E8 Shermans, and the bigger M26 Pershing heavy tanks, although a limited number of the new M46 Patton tanks were also moved into the perimeter.|$|E
