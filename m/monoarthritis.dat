50|$|Osteoarthritis is a {{degenerative}} disease commonly involving the knees and hips. It results from {{erosion of the}} cartilage protecting the bones from rubbing together.

50|$|Less {{often it}} has been {{reported}} that persons may experience arthralgia, <b>monoarthritis,</b> or chronic polyarthritis that mimics rheumatoid arthritis, leading to a difficult diagnosis for this disease.

50|$|When {{faced with}} <b>monoarthritis,</b> {{one of the}} main {{decisions}} to make is whether to perform a joint aspirate by inserting a needle into the affected joint and removing some fluid for microscopic analysis.

40|$|Many factors impact {{cognitive}} impairment; {{however, the}} effects of chronic pain and the mechanisms underlying these effects on cognitive impairment are currently unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic pain accelerates the transition from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 5 -month-old transgenic APP/PS 1 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and that neurotoxicity induced by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) subunits {{may be involved in}} this process. Chronic <b>monoarthritis</b> pain was induced in transgenic APP/PS 1 mice and 5 -month-old wild-type (WT) mice by intra- and pre-articular injections of Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) into one knee joint. Pain behavior, learning and memory function, and the distribution and quantity of NMDAR subunits (NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B) in hippocampal CA 1 and CA 3 regions were assessed. Our results showed that although persistent and robust <b>monoarthritis</b> pain was induced by the FCA injections, only the transgenic APP/PS 1 mice with chronic <b>monoarthritis</b> pain exhibited marked learning and memory impairments. This result suggested that chronic <b>monoarthritis</b> pain accelerated the cognitive impairment process. Furthermore, only transgenic APP/PS 1 mice with chronic <b>monoarthritis</b> pain exhibited an overexpression of NR 2 B and an increased NR 2 B/NR 2 A ratio in the hippocampus CA 3. These findings suggest that chronic pain is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and that increased neurotoxicity associated with NMDAR subunit activation may underpin the impairment. Thus, NMDARs may be a therapeutic target for the prevention of chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment...|$|E

40|$|Trauma is the commonest {{cause of}} acute monoarticular joint pain and {{swelling}} in patients attending {{an accident and}} emergency (A&E) department. However, in a significant minority of patients {{there will be no}} history of trauma and consequently a different approach to assessment and investigation is required. Our aim is to offer an outline of how to assess, investigate, and manage a patient with <b>monoarthritis.</b> Despite advances in antibiotic treatment diagnostic delay partly explains why septic arthritis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. It is therefore imperative that joint infection is considered above all other diagnoses. Arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure and doctors in A&E medicine are encouraged to develop the skills required to aspirate large joints. In {{the same way that the}} A&E department is often portrayed as the shop window of a hospital, the joint can reflect a wide variety of internal diseases. Connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and vasculitis can all present with a <b>monoarthritis.</b> A non-specific reactive <b>monoarthritis</b> may be a feature of a wide variety of common and uncommon infections including, brucellosis, Lyme disease, and leptospirosis. Drugs are also associated with acute arthritis either through their metabolic consequences or as idiosyncratic drug reactions. The ability for the joint to reflect multisystem disease necessitates close liaison with specialists from other fields. A multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients is strongly encouraged as some will have unusual diseases that require specialist advice. It is not difficult to appreciate how the patient with <b>monoarthritis</b> can present the clinician with a fascinating diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, which we hope this article will help to unravel...|$|E
30|$|Returning to {{the effects}} of {{adjuvant}} arthritis on the serum oxidative status (Tables  2, 3), it is possible to note that, ascorbic acid was the only parameter whose concentration was found to be modified by <b>monoarthritis.</b> The ascorbic acid concentration, in principle at least, can be regarded as an indicator for <b>monoarthritis</b> in as much as polyarthritis caused a further drop in the ascorbic acid concentration, combined with substantial modifications in other parameters. It is important to mention, however, that the ascorbic acid levels may also fluctuate according to the nutritional status. This fact weakens substantially the role of the ascorbic acid concentration as an indicator of mild arthritis unless it is combined with another indicator as, for example, the albumin carbonyl groups (see next paragraph).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} synovial fluid analysis in predicting the outcome of psoriatic <b>monoarthritis.</b> METHODS: In synovial fluid from knee joints of 18 patients with psoriatic <b>monoarthritis</b> lasting less than six months, white blood cell count, acid phosphatase, lysozyme, and interleukin (IL) - 1 beta were determined. ESR and serum C reactive protein were also measured. To define the outcome, the patients were monitored {{for at least three}} years and then subdivided into those with polyarthritis and those without. RESULTS: Among the blood and synovial fluid indices considered, synovial fluid IL- 1 beta was the only variable which differed between the patients who developed polyarthritis, within three years and those without polyarthritis after this time, at 20. 82 (SD 8. 79) v 4. 19 (4. 73) pg ml- 1, P < 0. 0001). A correlation was found between synovial fluid IL- 1 beta concentrations and the number of affected joints after three years (r = 0. 739, P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of synovial fluid IL- 1 beta at disease onset may be useful in revealing the outcome of psoriatic <b>monoarthritis</b> since, among the variables considered in our study, this was the only one capable of predicting the evolution of monoarticular psoriatic arthritis to polyarthritis...|$|E

30|$|Like {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, the adjuvant arthritis {{may also}} be of greater or lesser severity, depending on the dose of the adjuvant that is utilized inthe induction. The classical model, named polyarthritis, is induced by high doses of Freund’s adjuvant and shows a strong and generalized inflammatory response, which affects multiple joints (five or more joints) (Donaldson et al. 1993; Bendele et al. 1999). On the other hand, {{it is also possible}} to induce a milder arthritis, known as <b>monoarthritis,</b> which is induced by a smaller dose of adjuvant and presents minor systemic effects and affects only one joint (Bracht et al. 2012; Donaldson et al. 1993). Thus, the present study aims to provide a detailed picture about the oxidative changes in the serum of rats with <b>monoarthritis</b> and polyarthritis and should also allow extrapolations for the serum of patients with greater or lesser severity of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Pseudoseptic {{arthritis}} is {{an acute}} inflammatory <b>monoarthritis</b> with a sterile synovial gram stain and culture.

40|$|Septic {{arthritis}} typically presents as a hot, swollen joint. Rapid {{recognition and}} treatment of this condition is essential to prevent permanent joint damage.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the therapeutic efficacy of intravenously administered immunoselected STRO- 3 [*]+[*]mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) on clinical scores, joint pathology and cytokine production in an ovine model of <b>monoarthritis.</b> Methods <b>Monoarthritis</b> was established in 16 adult merino sheep by administration of bovine type II collagen into the left hock joint following initial sensitization to this antigen. After 24  h, sheep were administered either 150 million allogeneic ovine MPCs (n[*]=[*] 8) or saline (n[*]=[*] 8) intravenously (IV). Lameness, joint swelling and pain were monitored and blood samples for leukocytes and cytokine levels were collected at intervals following arthritis induction. Animals were necropsied 14  days after arthritis induction and gross and histopathological evaluations were undertaken on tissues from the arthritic (left) and contralateral (right) joints. Results MPC-treated sheep demonstrated significantly reduced clinical signs of lameness, joint pain and swelling compared with saline controls. They also showed decreased cartilage erosions, synovial stromal cell activation and angiogenesis. This was accompanied by decreased infiltration of the synovial tissues by CD 4 + lymphocytes and CD 14 + monocytes/macrophages. Over the 3  days following joint arthropathy induction, the numbers of neutrophils circulating in the blood and plasma concentrations of activin A were significantly reduced in animals administered MPCs. Conclusions The results of this study have demonstrated the capacity of IV-administered MPCs to mitigate the clinical signs and some of the inflammatory mediators responsible for joint tissue destruction in a large animal model of <b>monoarthritis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Oligoarticular {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (oligoJIA), {{the most}} common chronic inflammatory arthritis of childhood, usually involves the knees and ankles. Severe oligoJIA <b>monoarthritis</b> presenting in a joint other than knees and ankles, is rare.

Those with hip arthritis also met the classification criteria for juvenile-onset spondylarthopathy. Median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 9. 50 months. Three children had already cartilage loss or erosive disease at diagnosis. Conclusions Children diagnosed with oligoJIA that present with <b>monoarthritis</b> of the hip, wrist and elbow can have aggressive disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Earlier {{results suggest}} that {{peripheral}} � 2 -adrenoceptors and opioid receptors may reduce arthritic pain. Fadolmidine is a highly selective � 2 -adrenoceptor agonist that has only limited central access after peripheral administration. We assessed the peripheral antinociceptive properties of fadolmidine and the potential contribution of peripheral opioid receptors to its antinociceptive effect in experimental <b>monoarthritis.</b> METHODS: After induction of <b>monoarthritis</b> in the knee joints of rats, we determined the frequency of vocalization induced by repetitive movement of the knee joint. Fadolmidine and clonidine were administered intraarticularly ipsi- or contralateral to the inflamed joint. Reversal of the fadolmidine-induced effect was attempted with subcutaneous (s. c.) administration of atipamezole, an � 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, and intraarticular administration of naloxone methiodide, an opioid receptor antagonist that does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier. RESULTS: Fadolmidine produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the vocalization response to movement of the inflamed knee joint, and this effect was significantl...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To control local inflammation, {{the role}} of {{intra-articular}} corticosteroid is well established; similarly, with time there are more reports {{on the experience of}} intra-articular anti-TNF agent for localized joint inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the safety, local tolerability and clinical response after combining intra-articular administration of corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents for recurrent inflammatory <b>monoarthritis.</b> METHODS: Patients with recurrent <b>monoarthritis</b> of the knee were recruited from our inflammatory arthritis clinics. These patients required intra-articular corticosteroids every 8 - 12 weeks, with good short-term results. Five such consecutive patients were invited to partake in this study. Patients were maintained on their baseline immunosuppressive therapy. After aspiration of knee joint, the involved joint was injected with 80 mg of methylprednisolone mixed with 5 ml of lignocaine 1 %; this was followed by the injection of an anti-TNF agent. RESULTS: In majority of our patients (three out of five), combining anti-TNF agent and methylprednisolone led to prolonged anti-inflammatory response, and these patients remain in remission to date (mean follow-up of 12 months). These responders were noted to be naive to anti-TNF therapy. Conversely, the remaining two patients were found to be on baseline systemic anti-TNF therapy, and both of them failed to respond either partly or completely. CONCLUSION: Combining intra-articular corticosteroid and anti-TNF agent has proved to be safe in our cohort of patients. We conclude that in particular subset of patients who suffer from recurrent inflammatory <b>monoarthritis</b> or oligoarthritis, combination therapy of intra-articular corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents appears attractive and promising...|$|E
