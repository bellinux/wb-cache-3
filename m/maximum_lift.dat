Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E

Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar.

Manual lifting is a {{frequent}} cause of back injury, {{and there is no}} evidence as to which training mode can provide the best training effect for lifting performance and muscle force. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of a squat lift training and a free weight muscle training program on the <b>maximum</b> <b>lifting</b> load and isokinetic peak torque in subjects without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments. Subjects. Thirty-six adults (20 male, 16 female) without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments participated. The subjects' mean age was 21. 25 years (SD= 1. 16, range= 20 - 24). Methods. Subjects were divided into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 (n= 12) performed squat lift training. Subjects in group 2 (n= 12) participated in free weight resistance training of their shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, knee extensors and trunk extensors. Subjects in group 3 (n= 12) served as controls. The <b>maximum</b> <b>lifting</b> load and isokinetic peak torques of the trunk extensors, knee extensors, elbow flexors, and shoulder abductors of each subject were measured before and after the study. Training was conducted on alternate days for 4 weeks, with an initial load of 80 % of each subject's maximum capacity and with the load increased by 5 % weekly. Results. All groups were comparable for all measured variables before the study. After 4 weeks, subjects in groups 1 and 2 demonstrated more improvement in <b>maximum</b> <b>lifting</b> load and isokinetic peak torque of the back extensors compared with the subjects in group 3, but the 2 training groups were not different. Conclusion and Discussion. The findings demonstrate that both squat lift and free weight resistance training are equally effective in improving the lifting load and isokinetic back extension performance of individuals without impairments.

2500|$|Each {{of these}} chine hulls {{has its own}} unique {{characteristics}} and use. The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag [...] hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced <b>maximum</b> <b>lift</b> and a smooth,fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are [...] more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a Vshape between 6and 23degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep Vform (between 18and 23degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.|$|E
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing <b>maximum</b> <b>lift,</b> and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic lift generated by flying with a nose-up attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E
