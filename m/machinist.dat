5|$|Ralph Edward Flanders (September 28, 1880 – February 19, 1970) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer, industrialist and Republican U.S. Senator {{from the}} state of Vermont. He grew up on subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, and was an apprentice <b>machinist</b> and draftsman, before training as a mechanical engineer. He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company.

5000|$|The core {{job of a}} <b>Machinist's</b> Mate is {{the engine}} room. A mechanic's job in the engine room is to operate the steam plant that {{provides}} propulsion, electric power (along with Electrician's Mates), potable water, and service steam to the ship. <b>Machinist's</b> Mates operate the boilers that generate the steam {{and use it to}} operate main engine (propulsion turbines), turbo generators, distilling units, and various auxiliary turbines.

5|$|After {{his return}} {{home from the}} {{sanatorium}} in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, {{he was laid off}} and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice <b>machinist</b> at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.|$|E
5|$|Director Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), though {{adapted from}} a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir {{comparatively}} straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by Shield for Murder (1954) and Rogue Cop (1954), with his scripts for Training Day (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, Dark Blue (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker Harsh Times (2006). Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï. The torments of The <b>Machinist</b> (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both Fight Club and Memento. In 2005, Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a <b>machinist</b> and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont. In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where Flanders became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E

The women were responsible for car seat covers and their strike eventually led to a complete halt to all car production. The Dagenham sewing <b>machinists</b> walked out when, {{as part of a}} regrading exercise, they were informed that their jobs were graded in Category B (less skilled production jobs), instead of Category C (more skilled production jobs), and that they would be paid 15% less than the full B rate received by men.|$|R

5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the shutter, one shell struck {{the edge of the}} shutter, creating fragments that killed the <b>machinist</b> attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a <b>machinist</b> aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of yellow fever. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a <b>machinist</b> died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E
