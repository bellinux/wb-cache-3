Both units share similar metamorphic soles and tectono-sedimentary mélanges at their bases. The intrusive section of the lower unit is composed by an alternation of troctolites with various ultramafic rock-types, including dunites, lherzolites, olivine-websterites, olivine-gabbros, anorthositic gabbros, gabbros and rare gabbronorites.

40|$|International audienceU-series {{studies in}} oceanic basalts are {{critical}} for understanding melting and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> in the Earth's mantle. The combined results of a detailed geochemical study of melting and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> at Theistareykir, northern Iceland, provide {{a strong case for}} <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> via channeled melt flow at an active spreading ridge. It has often been argued, however, that widely used melting and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> models, which simulate channeled <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> (i. e. fractional and/or dynamic melting), can only partially explain the global U-series systematics in oceanic basalts. As a consequence, more complicated models have been invoked, which suggest different styles of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> at different depths/pressures in the mantle, so-called “two-porosity models”. Alternatively, diffusion-controlled mechanisms have been proposed. Here we show that U–Th–Pa–Ra systematics in oceanic basalts can indeed be explained by models where melt transport occurs without chemical equilibrium between melt and solid when variations in all three critical melting parameters (residual porosity, upwelling rate of the solid mantle and melt velocity) are taken into account. Melting at ridges requires systematic variation of at least two critical melting parameters, most likely upwelling and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> rate. Melts generated with increasing lateral distance to the ridge axis are generated with slower upwelling rates and are extracted with lower velocities than melts created closer to the ridge axis. Melting at ocean islands, on the other hand, can successfully be explained by variations in upwelling rate only. Global U-series systematics in OIB originate from superimposed global variations in upwelling velocity due to different buoyancy fluxes and from local variation in upwelling velocity as a function of radial distance to the plume center. The model proposed here is consistent with other geochemical data for oceanic basalts and strongly supports <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> via high-porosity channels as a general means of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from the Earth's upper mantle...|$|E

40|$|Many {{unresolved}} {{questions in}} geodynamics {{revolve around the}} physical behaviour of the two-phase system of a silicate melt percolating through and interacting with a tectonically deforming host rock. Well-accepted equations exist to describe the physics of such systems and several previous studies have successfully implemented various forms of these equations in numerical models. To date, most such models of magma dynamics have focused on mantle flow problems and therefore employed viscous creep rheologies suitable to describe the deformation properties of mantle rock under high temperatures and pressures. However, {{the use of such}} rheologies is not appropriate to model <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, where the mode of deformation of the host rock transitions from ductile viscous to brittle elasto-plastic. Here, we introduce a novel approach to numerically model magma dynamics, focusing on the conceptual study of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from an asthenospheric source of partial melt through the overlying lithosphere and crust. To this end, we introduce an adapted set of two-phase flow equations, coupled to a visco-elasto-plastic rheology for both shear and compaction deformation of the host rock in interaction with the melt phase. We describe in detail how to implement this physical model into a finite-element code, and then proceed to evaluate the functionality and potential of this methodology using a series of conceptual model setups, which demonstrate the modes of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> occurring around the rheological transition from ductile to brittle host rocks.

The western belt is mainly represented by mid ocean ridge-type (MOR-type) ophiolites with high-Ti geochemical affinity. Nonetheless, the western belt also exhibits volcanic sequences in which an alternation of rocks showing distinct geochemical affinities referable to MOR-type and SSZ-type volcanics can be observed. These volcanics can be geochemically subdivided into four groups: (1) Group 1 basalts show high field strength element (HFSE) and rare earth element (REE) concentrations {{similar to those of}} ocean-floor basalts; (2) Group 2 volcanics include basalts, basaltic andesites, dacites and rhyolites, and are characterized by HFSE and light REE depletion similar to those observed in many low-Ti volcanics from SSZ settings; (3) Group 3 basalts are show geochemical features which are intermediate between Group 1 and 2.

In addition, boninites may also have been derived by comparatively lower degrees of hydrated partial melting of more refractory harzburgitic sources.

The data clearly confirm the variations from near normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB) chemistries (e. g., Site 834, Central Lau Spreading Center) to strongly arc-like (e. g., Site 839, Valu Fa), the latter closely comparable to the modern arc volcanoes. Sites 835 and 836 and the East Lau Spreading Center represent transitional chemistries. Bulk compositions range from andesitic to basaltic, but lavas from Sites 834 and 836 and the Central Lau Spreading Center extend toward more silica-undersaturated compositions. The Valu Fa and modern Tonga-Kermadec arc lavas, in contrast, are dominated by basaltic andesites. The phenocryst and groundmass mineralogies show the strong arc-like affinities of the Site 839 lavas, which are also characterized by the existence of very magnesian olivines (up to Fo 90 - 92) and Cr-rich spinels in Units 3 and 6, and highly anorthitic plagioclases in Units 2 and 9.

40|$|Major-element {{compositions}} {{of minerals}} in peridotite xenoliths from the Lac de Gras kimberlites provide {{constraints on the}} mode of lithosphere formation beneath the central Slave Craton, Canada. Magnesia contents of reconstructed whole rocks correlate positively with NiO and negatively with CaO contents, consistent with variable partial <b>melt</b> <b>extraction.</b> Alumina and Cr₂O₃ contents are broadly positively correlated, suggestive of melt depletion {{in the absence of}} a Cr–Al phase. Garnet modes are high at a given Al₂O₃ content (a proxy for melt depletion), falling about a 7 GPa melt depletion model. These observations, combined with high olivine Mg# and major-element relationships of FeO-poor peridotites (3 GPa (residual FeO content being a sensitive indicator of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> pressure), and similar high pressures of last equilibration (∼ 4. 2 to 5. 8 GPa), provide multiple lines of evidence that the mantle beneath the central Slave Craton has originated as a residue from high-pressure melting, possibly during plume subcretion. Apparent low melt depletion pressures for high-FeO peridotites (> 7. 5 wt%) could suggest formation in an oceanic setting, followed by subduction to their depth of entrainment. However, these rocks, which are characterised by low SiO₂ contents (< 43 wt%), are more likely to be the result of post-melting FeO-addition, leading to spuriously low estimates of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> pressures. They may have reacted with a silica-undersaturated melt that dissolved orthopyroxene, or experienced olivine injection by crystallising melts. A secular FeO-enrichment of parts of the deep mantle lithosphere is supported by lower average Mg# in xenolithic olivine (91. 7) compared to olivine inclusions in diamond (92. 6). 19 page(s...|$|E

500|$|Large {{areas of}} peat were laid {{down on the}} Somerset Levels, {{particularly}} in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets <b>melted.</b> Peat <b>extraction</b> on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. The raised bogs were extensively dug for peat for use as fuel up {{until the end of}} World War II after which the primary market was for horticulture. Large parts of Westhay Moor have now been dug back to the underlying clay exposing estuarine deposits dating from about 6000 BP before isolation from the sea and peat formation began. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. However, the resultant reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of [...] over 100years.|$|R
40|$|A microporous–mesoporous carbon with graphitic {{structure}} was {{developed as a}} matrix for the sulfur cathode of a Li–S cell using a mixed carbonate electrolyte. Sulfur was selectively introduced into the carbon micropores by a <b>melt</b> adsorption–solvent <b>extraction</b> strategy. The micropores act as solvent-restricted reactors for sulfur lithiation that promise long cycle stability. The mesopores remain unfilled and provide an ion migration pathway, while the graphitic structure contributes significantly to low-resistance electron transfer. The selective distribution of sulfur in micropores was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen cryosorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The high-rate stable lithiation–delithiation of the carbon–sulfur cathode was evaluated using galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cathode is able to operate reversibly over 800 cycles with a 1. 8 C discharge–recharge rate. This integration of a micropore reactor, a mesopore ion reservoir, and a graphitic electron conductor represents a generalized strategy to be adopted in research on advanced sulfur cathodes...|$|R
