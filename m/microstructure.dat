The <b>microstructure</b> of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine.

40|$|Two {{forms of}} <b>microstructures</b> in {{different}} types of asphaltenes and asphalt binder samples were discovered by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The first type of the <b>microstructures</b> is needle-shaped with a crystalline structure, while the second type is plate-shaped without a regular pattern. The size of the <b>microstructures</b> ranges from a few nanometers to several micrometers. The <b>microstructures</b> are more prevalent in field-aged asphalt binder and asphaltenes samples than those in nonaged ones. Experimental results indicate that both forms of <b>microstructures</b> are not made of wax, but asphaltenes molecules. The two forms of asphaltenes <b>microstructures</b> differ in morphology, microscopic structure, chemical composition, and resistance to electron radiation damage, indicating that they are formed by different mechanisms and have different physicochemical properties. Both types of <b>microstructures</b> also show thermal stability at elevated temperatures. The prevalence, size, {{and shape of the}} <b>microstructures</b> in field-aged asphalt binder may impart significant impacts on binder engineering properties in pavement use as well as its behaviors in recycling or rejuvenation.

In this study, a soft lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface <b>microstructures</b> in high replication to sandpapers. The effect of <b>microstructures</b> on coating’s hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to flat coatings, the <b>microstructured</b> coatings showed much higher water contact angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the flat coating exhibited a higher anticorrosive performance than the <b>microstructured</b> coatings. With the use of finer sandpaper, the groove size of the corresponding <b>microstructured</b> coating was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting process. As the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5. 7 [*]µm, the <b>microstructures</b> became too small for water to easily penetrate through. Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an increased anticorrosive performance compared to other <b>microstructured</b> coatings...|$|R
