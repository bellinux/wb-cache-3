40|$|A novel undecapeptide {{has been}} {{isolated}} and structurally characterized from the venoms of three species of New World pit vipers from the subfamily, Crotalinae. These include the <b>Mexican</b> <b>moccasin</b> (Agkistrodon bilineatus), the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis viridis), and the South American bushmaster (Lachesis muta). The peptide was purified {{from all three}} venoms {{using a combination of}} gel permeation chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. Automated Edman degradation sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry established its peptide primary structure as: Thr-Pro-Pro-Ala-Gly-Pro-Asp-Val-Gly-Pro-Arg-OH, with a non-protonated molecular mass of 1063. 18 Da. A synthetic replicate of the peptide was found to be an antagonist of bradykinin action at the rat vascular B 2 receptor. This is the first bradykinin inhibitory peptide isolated from snake venom. Database searching revealed the peptide to be highly structurally related (10 / 11 residues) with a domain residing between the bradykinin-potentiating peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide domains of a recently cloned precursor from tropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) venom gland. BIP thus represents a novel biological entity from snake venom...|$|E
