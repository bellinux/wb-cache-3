500|$|A {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] was filmed on 26 June 2006 in La Perla {{shantytown}} located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Rene Perez, of Calle 13, {{said he hoped}} that the video would help them both reach new audiences: [...] "It's a good opportunity for us both. More than the North American market, the European market really interests <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> because her family is Portuguese." [...] The video was directed by Israel Lugo and Gabriel Coss, photographed by Sonnel Velazquez and produced by María Estades.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Boy" [...] is {{considered}} to be a sequel in ways to [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde"; a 2002 Jay-Z song featuring Beyoncé. The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her. Paul remarked, [...] "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> going here and there, all over the world... I'm answering back, like, 'I'm wit it'." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other verses and choruses. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, resolving at the toasting and final verse.|$|E

500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her,</b> her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E

It {{was in this}} role that he discovered his ability to sing high notes. [...] "I'd been having a bad evening and I was miserable, felt I wasn't even {{good enough to be}} in the chorus. Then in my next scene I went up to the C sharp and it just stayed there. Christine, the soprano, was walking towards <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mouth fell open and she whispered to me, 'Wow, is that really you?' I've had those notes ever since." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{released}} a live video album on November 2, 1999 titled God Is in the T.V., which contained unreleased footage including a behind-the-scenes backstage {{look at some}} of the experiences the band underwent during the Beautiful Monsters Tour. He claimed it clarified the real motive for Hole's departure. He added, [...] "There's a really great speech [...] gives about <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> insecurity and lack of fans at the concerts. Although it disparages her somewhat, I find it very amusing." [...] He also {{released a}} live album on November 12, 1999 titled The Last Tour on Earth that documented curated performances by his band from various concerts during the tour.|$|E
2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and I told her I was there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E

60|$|I {{think that}} at first {{she did not see}} him. She swept round upon <b>me</b> <b>and</b> raised <b>her</b> veil.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned from}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mood changed swiftly. For she laughed lightly, musically, {{and put a}} hand on his shoulder.|$|E

60|$|A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> figure {{seemed to}} move in it for an instant. Then I felt the burning tears run down my face, and it was steady again.|$|E
