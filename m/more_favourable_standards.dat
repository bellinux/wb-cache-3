In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strike internationally. However, this kind of coordination was halted in the European Union in two decisions. In Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this [...] "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> <b>standards.</b> However, in The Rosella, the ECJ also held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' [...] "right to strike" [...] in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests. For this reason it has been questioned whether the ECJ's decisions were compatible with fundamental human rights, particularly the freedom of association guaranteed by article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{inducible}} {{molecular chaperone}} HSP 90 {{is of great}} importance as an anticancer target. Proteomic analysis showed that inhibiting HSP 90 by the geldanamycin derivative, 17 -AAG elevated {{the expression of the}} co-chaperone Hsp 70. In this study we used HSP 90 selective inhibitor 17 -AAG and HSP 70 / 90 dual inhibitor, VER 155008 (VER) in U 87 -MG glioma cells. miRNAs microarray technology was used to evaluate the efficacy of these inhibitory drugs compared with temozolomide (TMZ), used as a standard treatment for glioma. Microarrays data identified 154 differentially expressed miRNAs using stringent or unstringent parameters. 16 miRNAs were overlapped between treatments, 13 upregulated and one downregulated miRNA were overlapped between TMZ and VER. The miRNA target prediction software was used for these overlapped miRNAs and identified 6 of the 13 upregulated miRNAs target methyltransferase genes. The IC 50, together with Akt and HSP 70 and 90 protein level data favour VER and TMZ to 17 -AAG, however due to the selectivity of VER to cancer cells as a potent antichaperon, it may be <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> to the <b>standard</b> TMZ...|$|R
40|$|Cohorts born {{until the}} late 1940 s benefited from a clear {{generation}}al progress: {{from one generation to}} the next, the conditions for entering the labour market were <b>more</b> <b>favourable,</b> living <b>standards</b> increased regularly, access to education and homeownership was more common. These progresses strongly slowed down and even stopped, for generations born in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Early in their life course, the latter had to face the two oil shocks and the bad economic context that followed. The most recent generations are experiencing a mixed picture. Several years of good economic performance at the turn of the 2000 s helped to increase again their standard of living in comparison to previous generations at the same age. Then, they benefited from low interest rates that facilitated again access to the property, despite rising property prices. However, this improvement appears to be very dependent on the macroeconomic environment, which can easily turn around. Inequalities between generations go together with inequalities within generations. In particular, access to employment is closely linked to educational level. Graduate people are more protected from unemployment and get a stable job more easily, but such an improvement is at the cost of a downgrading as regards wages and employment position. Non-graduates, meanwhile, are more dependent on economic conditions, not only at the end of their studies but also during the beginning of their careers. Finally, the fragility of this generational progress, and the increased importance of intergenerational transfers of wealth, could possibly lead to a widening of the gap between social classes or social origins. For instance, since the beginning of the 2000 s, the access of younger generations to property has been improving again but the gap in property rates between social categories has been increasing. intergenerational inequalities, social inequalities, cohorts...|$|R

A Thurstone attitude scale {{was constructed in}} a split-half form (19 + 19) to test attitudes to school science and science in general. Another, based on this, was constructed to test attitudes to school physics and physics in general. Reliabilities of both scales were 0. 80 or more. The sample was 1066 pupils aged 11 + years 15 + years in grammar and modern schools. This sample {{was found to be}} significantly favourable to science and the grammar school sample was <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> than the modern school sample.

The samples were matched for proportions of each sex. Using the attitude to physics scale, 117 fourth-year pupils of four grammar schools which taught physics according to the Nuffield foundation scheme were compared with 117 fourth-year pupils from equivalent streams in four grammar schools which taught physics in a conventional manner. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that the Nuffield scheme produced <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> attitudes to physics than conventional approaches. There was a little evidence to support the view that a conventional approach produced <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> attitudes to physics.

40|$|Abstract Social {{services}} are rendered to those citizens, who require them considering their health, age or unfavourable social situation {{and who are}} unable of overcoming their social burdens and less than auspicious circumstances without external aid. Social {{services are}} essential not just because many people require them but particularly because were they not to be available, {{a large part of}} the public would lose their ability to participate in all aspects of life in a society. This would make it impossible for their human and civil rights to be upheld and lead to their exclusion from society. Social development, <b>more</b> <b>favourable</b> living <b>standards,</b> progress in the field of medicine and championing of social rights result in less people dying in childhood or at a productive age nowadays than before. It can be argued that the number of pensioners will be constantly increasing and that this is an accompaniment of a successfully developing civilisation. Because of their numbers, pensioners are becoming an exceptionally grave subject of social exclusion. It is therefore imperative that we realise the disadvantages the elderly face and devote appropriate attention to the issues surrounding the planning of social services. In terms of the set objective, it is necessary to evaluate and compare individual mid-term plans for the development of social services at certain locations and also to compare and evaluate the communal plans of selected cities. The dissertation proved that it is indeed necessary to pay due attention to the studied planning of social services. This is because there is a need to harmonise supply and demand in relation to social services. Ensuring the availability of a high-quality social services network for the elderly is only possible given the presence of a complex concept of social and medical care. One must however always take into consideration not just the current demographic trends but also the circumstances in the particular area as well as the degree of interest of the various subjects who are immediately involved in the issues surrounding the particular type of social services. One can undoubtedly say that the quality of social services on offer (not just for the elderly) is increasing both in relation to law No. 108 / 2006 Col. regarding social services but also in accordance with the recipients? wishes and demands...|$|R
