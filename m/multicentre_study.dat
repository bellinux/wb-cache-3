5|$|The WHO/EURO <b>Multicentre</b> <b>Study</b> of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that most (but not all) of the contradictory studies are smaller, single hospital and statistically underpowered (Aylin, 2016); two very large neonatology studies (Gould et al., 2003; Luo et al, 2004) are the exceptions.

50|$|People of African, Japanese and Chinese descent {{are rarely}} diagnosed; this {{reflects}} {{a much lower}} prevalence of the genetic risk factors, such as HLA-B8. People of Indian ancestry {{seem to have a}} similar risk to those of Western Caucasian ancestry. Population studies also indicate that a large proportion of coeliacs remain undiagnosed; this is due, in part, to many clinicians being unfamiliar with the condition and also due to the fact it can be asymptomatic. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men. A large <b>multicentre</b> <b>study</b> in the U.S. found a prevalence of 0.75% in not-at-risk groups, rising to 1.8% in symptomatic people, 2.6% in second-degree relatives (like grandparents, aunt or uncle, grandchildren, etc.) of a person with coeliac disease and 4.5% in first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children). This profile is similar to the prevalence in Europe. Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease, with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 10%, include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease, including both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).|$|E

3000|$|Overall, {{our study}} {{supports}} {{the statement that}} harmonizing quantification and optimal lesion detection do not necessarily {{go hand in hand}} and are partially vendor-dependent [9]. Despite all recent progress and efforts, {{there are still a lot}} of questions remaining. It seems advisable to apply the lesion detection protocol in diagnostic clinical contexts for individual patients. However, it also seems advisable to select the EARL protocol in <b>multicentre</b> <b>studies</b> and individual therapy response monitoring, in order to reliably compare SUL among patients, scanners, and centres. However, it is clear that PET exams of individual patients should always be examined using the best possible lesion detection protocol. One may wonder whether centres participating in <b>multicentre</b> <b>studies</b> should always carry out two reconstruction protocols. Can lesion detection protocols be implemented in the EARL accreditation program? Or would it be possible to harmonize quantification and lesion detectability without trade-offs? [...]...|$|R

30|$|Fourth, the {{population}} {{size of the}} majority of studies is relatively small.
