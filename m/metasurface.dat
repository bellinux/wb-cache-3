25|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} with conductive polymers {{have also}} been suggested as one kind of electronic paper. The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective <b>metasurface</b> made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on {{the thickness of the}} insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5nbsp&mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.|$|E

5000|$|Most recently, the {{geometric}} phase concept {{has been adopted}} for OAM generation. The geometric phase is modulated {{to coincide with the}} spatial phase dependence factor, i.e., [...] of an OAM carrying wave. In this way, geometric phase is introduced by using anisotropic scatterers. For example, a metamaterial composed of distributed linear polarizers in a rotational symmetric manner generates an OAM of order 1. To generate higher-order OAM wave, nano-antennas which can produce the spin-obit coupling effect are designed and then arranged to form a <b>metasurface</b> with different topological charges. Consequently, the transmitted wave carries an OAM, and its order is twice the value of the topological charge. Usually, the conversion efficiency is not high for the transmission-type <b>metasurface.</b> Alternative solution to achieve high transmittance is to use complementary (Babinet-inverted) <b>metasurface.</b> On the other hand, {{it is much easier to}} achieve high conversion efficiency, even 100% efficiency in the reflection-type <b>metasurface</b> such as the composite PEC-PMC <b>metasurface.</b>|$|E

The main topics that are studied are absorbing <b>metasurfaces,</b> metamirrors, Huygens' <b>metasurfaces,</b> and parity-time-symmetric <b>metasurfaces.</b>  In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we introduce the general theory of off-band-transparent absorbing <b>metasurfaces.</b> First, we consider <b>metasurfaces</b> which symmetrically absorb electromagnetic waves hitting any of their sides. As an example for symmetric absorbing <b>metasurfaces,</b> we introduce a novel off-band-transparent light absorber composed of a single array of core-shell particles. We continue this study by introducing the concept of asymmetric absorbing <b>metasurfaces.</b> We study single-layer sheets which work as total absorbers only from one side and investigate what functionalities can be engineered for illumination from the opposite side.  The second part of the thesis is devoted to the concept of off-band-transparent reflecting <b>metasurfaces.</b> We consider both symmetric and asymmetric metamirrors. We show how arrays of electrically small resonant bianisotropic particles can be employed to fully reflect electromagnetic plane waves hitting any of their sides while enabling independent and full control over the phase of waves reflected from their different sides.   The third part of the thesis focuses on the concept of Huygens' <b>metasurfaces.</b> We first present the concept of symmetric and asymmetric transparent <b>metasurfaces.</b> We introduce one-way transparent <b>metasurfaces</b> which offer controllable functionalities for waves hitting their non-transparent sides. We furthermore introduce the concept of all-angle Huygens' <b>metasurfaces.</b> These <b>metasurfaces</b> are reflectionless for any arbitrary input wavefront while enabling manipulation of transmitted waves in unprecedented ways.   In the last part of the thesis, we study the concept of parity-time-symmetric <b>metasurfaces.</b> Utilizing these <b>metasurfaces,</b> it is shown how electromagnetic plane waves can be fully recreated behind a highly reflecting metallic screen. The proposed structure works as a new form of one-dimensional cloak which is capable of cloaking an almost fully reflective metallic screen in both spectrally and angularly selective manner...|$|R

Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200 nm), which is thinner than all current dielectric lenses (~ µm scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300 nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6 µm in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with <b>metasurface</b> by FIB.
