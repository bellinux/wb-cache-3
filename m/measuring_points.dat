40|$|An {{accurate}} and efficient measurement for unknown rotor profile of screw compressor {{has been a}} nodus {{in the field of}} coordinate measuring machine (CMM) measurement because of its complexity of 3 D helical surface, whose normal vectors vary with different <b>measured</b> <b>points,</b> while conventional 2 D measuring methods have the inevitable radius compensation. If <b>measured</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding normal vectors are known, a 3 D radius compensation then could be applied without a theoretical error. In this paper, a double-measurement method based on Reverse Engineering (RE) is proposed to solve this problem. The first measurement focused on constructing a 3 D CAD model as accurate as possible. So, according to the structure characteristics of the unknown rotor, a reasonable WCS is established firstly. Then a DRCH method is presented to eliminate the outliers of <b>measured</b> <b>points.</b> Finally, an indirect method is presented to measure the screw pitch with projection and transformation of <b>measured</b> <b>point</b> sets. In second section, a 3 D measurement is planned by DIMS language with setting <b>measured</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding normal vectors, which are calculated according to 3 D CAD model constructed in first section.
