The response was {{the amount of}} n(6 Li, T) reactions occurring in a TLD 600 located {{at the center of}} a cylindrical polyethylene moderator. Fluence, (n, a) and H*(10) responses were calculated for 47 monoenergetic neutron sources. The H*(10) relative response was compared with responses of commercially available neutron monitors being alike. Due to 6 Li cross section (n,) reactions are mainly produced by thermal neutrons, however TLD 600 is sensitive to gamma-rays; to eliminate the signal due to photons <b>monitor</b> <b>area</b> was built to hold 2 pairs of TLD 600 and 2 pairs of TLD 700, thus from the difference between TLD 600 and TLD 700 readouts the net signal due to neutrons is obtained.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the p-percent coverage {{problem in this}} paper and propose two algorithms to prolong network lifetime {{based on the fact}} that for some applications full coverage is not necessary and different subareas of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area</b> may have different coverage requirements. The first algorithm, CPCA, is a centralized algorithm which selects the least number of nodes to monitor p-percent of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area.</b> The second algorithm, DPCP, is a distributed algorithm which can determine a set of nodes in a distributed manner to cover p-percent of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area.</b> Both of the algorithms guarantee network connectivity. The simulation results show that our algorithms can remarkably prolong network lifetime, have less than 5 % unrequired coverage for large networks and employ nodes fairly for most cases. I...|$|R

Primarily designed for monitoring purposes, many sensor applications require continuous collection and processing of sensed data. Due to the limited power supply for sensor nodes, energy efficiency is a major performance concern in query processing. In this paper, we focus on continuous kNN query processing in object tracking sensor networks. We propose a localized scheme to monitor nearest neighbors to a query point. The key idea is to establish a <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> for each query so that only the updates relevant to the query are collected. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> is set up when the kNN query is initially evaluated and is expanded and shrunk on the fly upon object movement. We analyze the optimal maintenance of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> and develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically decide when to shrink the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area.</b> Experimental results show that establishing a <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> for continuous kNN query processing greatly reduces energy consumption and prolongs network lifetime...|$|E

Therefore, this paper proposes heterogeneous nodes based on association covering algorithm. On one hand, this algorithm is handled through the Poisson model of structure joint probability density formula and it is also based on the node density formula to establish sensor node in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> in order to efficiently cover the focused target. On the other hand, it updates through the node's own state scheduling mechanism and converts neighbor nodes dynamically about matching scheduling, which can balance the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> sensor node residual energy and node energy consumption. Therefore it can achieve the purpose of prolonging network lifetime. Finally, the simulation results show that the algorithm not only can use fewer nodes to effectively cover the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> completely and improve the coverage of the network but also can optimize resource allocation and prolong the network lifetime.   </p...|$|E
