40|$|AbstractUnresectable periampullary {{cancer is}} {{commonly}} characterized by painless jaundice {{and has a}} rapid evolution with dismal prognosis. Biliary drainage {{can be achieved by}} various techniques and approaches, with the endoscopic drainage being the preferred method. However, when open surgery is performed with the intent to resect a tumor which is finally found to be unresectable, open drainage of the biliary tree is indicated. We present a new technique of cholecystojejunostomy using a circular <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler,</b> which could be used in patients with intact gallbladder and widely patent the cystic duct. The described cholecystoenterostomy {{with the use of a}} circular <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> is the first reported in the literature. The procedure has been successfully used in 6 patients with excellent results. No early recurrence of biliary obstruction, cholangitis or post-operative anastomotic complications were observed. The relative simplicity of the procedure, the shorter operative time and the effective relief of jaundice, are the main advantages of the proposed technique. We believe that this method needs further investigation and can be proved effective in reducing hospitalization and anastomotic complications, compared to hand-sewn techniques...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{applied a}} {{computer-controlled}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> to vascular end-to-end anastomosis {{to achieve an}} automatic aortic anastomosis between the aorta and an artificial graft. In this experimental study, we created a mechanical end-to-end anastomotic model and assessed {{the strength of the}} anastomotic site under high pressure. MethodsWe used a computer-controlled circular stapler named iDrive (Power Medical Interventions, Covidien plc, Dublin, Ireland) for the anastomosis between the porcine aorta and an artificial graft. Then the mechanically stapled group (group A) and the manually sutured group (group B) were compared 10 times, and we assessed the differences at several levels of pressure. ResultsTo use a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> in vascular anastomosis, some special preparations of both the aorta and the artificial graft are necessary to narrow the open end before the procedures. To solve this problem, we established a specially designed purse-string suture for both and finally established end-to-end vascular anastomosis. The anastomosis speed of group A was statistically significantly faster than that of group B (P < . 01). The group A anastomotic sites also showed significantly more tolerance to high pressure than those of group B. ConclusionsThe computer-controlled stapling device enabled reliable anastomosis of the aorta and the artificial graft. This study showed that mechanical vascular anastomosis with the iDrive was sufficiently strong and safe relative to manual suturing...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} procedures in digestive-tract surgery is esophago-jejunal anastomosis following total gastrectomy. Cost/benefit analysis of this procedure justifies the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>staplers,</b> in spite of their high cost. A technical variant of the side-to-side esophago-jejunal anastomosis is presented, which incorporates the use of a cutting linear stapler. Technical maneuvers are easy to perform, the cost of the cutting linear stapler is smaller than the circular ones, the amplitude of the anastomosis is wider and the likelihood of fistulae is smaller when compared to other techniques. The side-to-side esophago-jejunal anastomosis with the cutting linear stapler is always complemented by a manual suture...|$|R
30|$|The {{next steps}} of this {{technique}} focus on preparing the vaginal approach to the ureteral tunnel. The aim of the dissection of the vesicovaginal plane is to identify the caudal limit of the vesicouterine ligaments and to perform a colpotomy in the anterior face of the vagina that is wide enough to let us place and bring out the end of two vessel loops. The posterior peritoneum is incised toward the uterosacral ligaments. The ureter is identified and separated from the peritoneum down to where it crosses the uterine artery, just {{at the beginning of}} the ureteral tunnel. The rectovaginal space is developed, and both uterosacral ligaments are cut. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> such as the EndoGIA or similar is a good alternative to bipolar cautery of the uterosacral ligaments.|$|E
40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> is {{routinely}} used in thoracic surgery practice to attend resection of bronchus and vessels.

A misdiagnosis of asthma was made and she treated for 6 months with bronchodilators, corticosteroid and antihistaminic without success. Thus, patient re-referred of our unit. No clinical signs of infection as fewer, productive cough, dyspnea were present. The laboratory exams were within normal value including white cells. CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Bronchoscopy demonstrated a healed upper bronchus stump without evidence of an actual, open bronchopleural fistula but with clips apparently working {{their way into the}} airway, with approximately half of the clip visible within the lumen.

40|$|Diffuse tracheobronchial {{calcification}} is {{a physiological}} condition associated with advanced age, especially in women. A calcified bronchus can be fractured during major lung resections (lobectomy, bilobectomy, and pneumonectomy), exposing patients to intraoperative air leakage and broncho-pleural fistula (BPF) occurrence. We retrospectively evaluated {{the use of}} Progel® application on the suture line of bronchial stump after pulmonary lobectomy analysing the intraoperative air leak and BPF occurrence. Between January 2014 and December 2014, Progel® was applied in 11 patients who presented intraoperative bronchial fractures after suture resection by mechanical staplers and air leak from bronchial stump, in order to treat air leakage. Patients were 7 men and 4 women, aged between 56 and 81 years (mean age 71. 2 ± 12. 1 years). Surgical procedures included 6 upper lobectomies (4 right, 2 left), 1 bilobectomy and 4 lower lobectomies (3 right, 1 left). Mean hospital stay was 4. 5 ± 2. 6 days (2 - 8 days). None of the patients had postoperative air leakage. No Progel® application-related complications occurred. No other major complications occurred. No mortality occurred.

40|$|Mucosal stomal {{prolapse}} is {{a frequent}} complication of end colostomies. We describe here an original mucosal colostomy prolapse repair technique using a circular stapling device. This technique stems from the recent introduction of stapled muco-haemorrhoidectomy and was employed on a 68 -year-old male patient who had undergone a Miles abdominoperineal excision 17 years earlier. On clinical inspection the patient presented a 5 -cm. mucosal stomal prolapse on straining. The surgical procedure was performed under i. v. sedation with midazolam and propofol. After draping the abdomen, the stomal mucosa was gently everted {{with the aid of}} three Allis forceps, and a 1. 0 prolene purse string suture was created 4 - 6 cm. cephalad to the cutaneous rim of the stoma. The head of a 33 -mm circular stapler was introduced and the purse string suture was tied. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> was prepared and fired, thus obtaining a resection anastomosis of the prolapsed stomal mucosa. No bleeding occurred. A 24 -F bladder catheter was placed cephalad to the stapled line and removed on postoperative day one. The patient was discharged from hospital the day after surgery. During a 16 -month follow-up neither complications nor relapses have so far been observed. Our technique appears to be simple and safe. We believe it is indicated only for mucosal stomal prolapses, while full-thickness stomal prolapses should be managed by conventional techniques. A larger cohort of patients is needed to confirm our preliminary result...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{performed}} a laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy followed by constructing a Y-shaped reservoir extra-corporeally with titanium staples through a 5 -cm muscle-splitting Pfannenstiel incision. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Upon {{completion of the}} extirpative part of the operation, the surgical specimen was entrapped and removed intact through a 5 -cm Pfannenstiel incision. Through the extraction incision, the distal ileum was identified and a 40 cm segment isolated. With {{the aid of the}} laparoscope, the ureters were brought outside the abdominal cavity and freshened and spatulated for approximately 1. 5 -cm. Bilateral double J ureteral stents were then inserted up to the renal pelvis and the ureters were directly anastomosed to the open ends of the limbs of the neobladder. Following this, the isolated intestinal segment was arranged in a Y shape with two central segments of 14 cm and two limbs of 6 cm. The two central segments were brought together and detubularized, with two sequential firings of 80 x 3. 5 mm and 60 x 3. 5 mm non-absorbable <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler</b> (Multifire GIA - US Surgical) inserted through an opening made at the lowest point of the neobladder on its anti-mesenteric border. The neobladder was reinserted inside the abdominal cavity and anastomosed to the urethra with intracorporeal laparoscopic free-hand suturing. CONCLUSION: Although this procedure is feasible and the preliminary results encouraging, continued surveillance is necessary to determine the lithiasis-inducing potential of these titanium staples within the urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform an experimental study to be compared under the pathological-anatomic, point of view, the manual and mechanical sutures in the main bronchus after left pneumonectomy in dogs. Eighteen adult mongrel, healthy dogs, both male and female, were utilized weighing from 9 to 27. 5 kg. The dogs were submitted to a selective intubation and left thorax incision in the 5 th intercostal space where a pneumonectomy was performed. Were separated into 2 groups of 9 dogs according to the type of suture employed: Group A - a manual suture with polypropylene 5 -O; Group B- a mechanical suture with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stapler,</b> model TL- 30. Each group was subdivided into 3 subgroups of 3 animals and a temporal postoperative study was established at 7, 15 and 36 days where an pathological-anatomic evaluation was made on the healing of the manual and mechanical sutures. During the histopathological evaluation, the intensity of inflammation, fibrosis, neoformed vessels, and the presence or absence of granulation tissue, foreign body reaction and necrosis were evaluated qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. The results found were analyzed statistically. Regarding the histopathologic analysis, foreign body reaction occured in the left bronchial stump in 88, 9 % of the dogs submitted to a manual suture and in none of the dogs submitted to a mechanical suture. There is still, significant statistical difference in the dogs in Groups A and B in relation to the intensity of the inflammation, the greatest intensity being in the dogs submitted to the manual suture. It is concluded that both types of sutures brought an adequate healing of the main left bronchial stump, although there was a greater intensity of inflammation and a greater occurence of foreign body reaction in the dogs submitted to the manual suture...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{satisfaction}} rating of currently available <b>mechanical</b> <b>staplers</b> for Japanese surgeons with small hands is low. To identify the issue, {{we examined the}} relationship of hand dimensions and grip force with the operation force of a <b>mechanical</b> circular <b>stapler.</b> Methods Hand dimensions and grip force were measured in 113 Japanese surgeons (52 men and 61 women). We then evaluated the relationship between grip width and the operation force required to push the lever of the stapler, at three points on the lever, using a digital force gauge. Results The optimal grip width of the dominant hand was 62. 5 ± 8. 5 mm for men and 55. 5 ± 5. 9 mm for women (p 0. 001). The maximum grip force of the dominant hand was 44. 2 ± 6. 1 kg for men and 29. 7 ± 4. 5 kg for women (p 0. 001) and the maximum operation force required to push the lever 7. 0, 45. 0, and 73. 0 mm {{from the end of}} the lever was 21. 8, 28. 6, and 42. 4 kg, respectively. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first ergo-nomic study of a surgical stapler to be conducted in Asia. Firing the stapler by gripping the proximal side of the lever is physically impossible for most Japanese women sur-geons since the required operation force exceeds the maximum grip force, which probably accounts for the stress perceived by these women...|$|R

Every technique must be reproduced reliably by the majority of surgeons for their results to be adopted and recognized as effective. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the results, from the point of view of anatomic pathology, of manual sutures versus mechanical sutures using different models of linear mechanical staplers, in the procedure of gastroenteroanastomosis and enteroanastomosis in swine. Methods: Thirty-six healthy, adult, male Sus scrofa domesticus pigs, weighing between 20. 7 and 25. 5 kg, were used. The swine were randomly divided into four groups of nine pigs, according to the type of suture employed: group A, manual suture with Polysorb® 3 - 0 wire; group B, 80 -shear linear stapler (Covidien® Gia 8038 -S); group C, 75 -shear linear stapler (Ethicon® Tlc 75); and group D, 75 -shear linear stapler (Resource® Yq 75 - 3). A temporal study was established on the seventh postoperative day for histopathological analysis, and the degree of inflammation, fibrosis, and newly formed vessels, as well as the presence or absence of granulation tissue, foreign body granuloma, and necrosis were all evaluated qualitatively and semiquantitatively. The results were analyzed statistically. Results: Observations during the histopathological analysis included the formation of foreign body granuloma in the gastroenteroanastomosis and enteroanastomosis in 88. 9 % of the swine that underwent manual suture and in none of the swine that underwent stapling. There was also a significant statistical difference among swine from Group A, and those from groups B, C and D regarding the degree of inflammation, being more intense in those swine that underwent manual suture. Conclusion: This study shows that both types of suture promoted proper healing of gastroenteroanastomosis and enteroanastomosis, although there was a higher degree of inflammation and an increased occurrence of foreign body granuloma in swine subjected to manual suture, although there have been similarities in safety, efficiency, and effectiveness between the models of linear mechanical staplers tested during the performance of these anastomoses on swine.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{mechanical}} stapling devices in laparoscopic appendectomies {{has become a}} common practice. Occasionally, the retained staples have been described to cause adhesions that might result in bowel obstruction. Early bowel obstruction after routine abdominal surgery should be closely investigated and might warrant early re-exploration. We present a rare case of small bowel obstruction caused by a staple line adhesive band one week after appendectomy. A 46 -year-old female underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. A linear endoscopic stapling device was utilized during the procedure. The patient was discharged without complication. One week later, the patient presented {{to the emergency room}} for abdominal pain and she was discharged after adequate pain control. Several hours later she returned with similar symptoms, and she was diagnosed with distal small bowel obstruction by computed tomography scan. During the diagnostic laparoscopy there was an internal hernia through a defect created by the appendiceal staple line and the adjacent small bowel mesentery. After reduction of the hernia, the small bowel venous drainage improved, and no intestinal resection was necessary. The offending staple was removed and the staple line covered with omentum.

Medical therapy was efficacious in resolving the clinical symptoms in 133. One hundred and ten pts. were treated surgically: 91 (82. 7 %) underwent a left hemicolectomy (one-step surgery), 13 (11. 8 %) the Hartmann's procedure and 6 (5. 4 %) a sigmoid resection. Between 1974 and 1980, when anastomoses were performed manually and an excluding colostomy was the procedure of choice, the reported rate of anastomotic dehiscence was 21 %.

40|$|Background. Lung {{transplantation}} is {{a robust}} therapeutic option to treat patients with cystic fibrosis. Patients and methods. Since 1996, 109 patients with cystic fibrosis were accepted onto our waiting list with 58 bilateral sequential lung transplants performed in 56 patients and two patients retransplanted for obliterative bronchiolitis syndrome. Results. Preoperative mean FEV 1 was 0. 64 L/s, mean PaO 2 with supplemental oxygen was 56 mm Hg, {{and the mean}} 6 -minute walking test was 320 m. Transplantation was performed through a "clam shell incision" in the first 29 patients and via bilateral anterolateral thoracotomies without sternal division in the remaining patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass was required in 14 patients. In 21 patients the donor lungs had to be trimmed by wedge resections with <b>mechanical</b> <b>staplers</b> and bovine pericardium buttressing to fit the recipient chest size. Eleven patients were extubated {{in the operating room}} immediately after the procedure. Hospital mortality of 13. 8 % was related to infection (n = 5), primary graft failure (n = 2), and myocardial infarction (n = 1). Acute rejection episodes occurred 1. 6 times per patient/year; lower respiratory tract infections occurred 1. 4 times per patient in the first year after transplantation. The mean FEV 1 increased to 82 % at 1 year after operation. The 5 -year survival rate was 61 %. A cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen was initially employed in all patients; 24 were subsequently switched to tacrolimus because of central nervous system toxicity, cyclosporine-related myopathy, or renal failure, obliterative bronchiolitis syndrome, gingival hyperplasia, or hypertrichosis. Ten patients were subsequently switched to sirolimus. Freedom from bronchiolitis obliterans at 5 years was 60 %. Conclusions.

40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of endovision techniques and equipment miniaturization in urology {{make it possible}} to perform laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) nephrectomy. Radical nephrectomy due to renal cancer performed with LESS is not a standard procedure in urology. Aim: To present our preliminary results and operative technique of LESS radical nephrectomy. Material and methods: The study was carried out after team experience based on LESS radical nephrectomy performed from October 2009 to June 2010 in 11 cases. A single port with 3 working channels (Triport Access System, OLYMPUS®) and a 5 mm laparoscope 30 ° were used. The approach was created by minilaparotomy technique on the lateral margin of the rectus muscle, 4 cm above the umbilicus. The procedure was performed using standard laparoscopic instruments, bent or articulating graspers, and scissors. During the surgery metal and plastic clips were used, and a <b>mechanical</b> vascular <b>stapler</b> in two cases. In every case bipolar coagulation was used. The postoperative specimen was removed via single-port minilaparotomy. After surgery, one suction drain 14 F was left. Results: In all patients the procedure was performed without conversion to standard, open technique. In two cases accessory port (10 and 12 mm) placement was necessary, for organ retraction or insertion of a vascular stapler. Mean surgery time was 128 min (120 - 160 min). Mean blood loss was 155 ml (100 - 250 ml). There were no complications during surgery or the postoperative period. Mean hospitalization stay was 4 days (3 - 5 days). Clinical stage of renal cell cancer (RCC) was pT 1 a in 1, pT 1 b in 9, and pT 3 a in 1 patient. The results of histopathological examination show typical RCC in 10 cases, and papillary RCC in 1. Conclusions: LESS nephrectomy is effective but technically difficult. LESS nephrectomy is a considerably less invasive procedure than standard laparoscopic nephrectomy, unless accessory port placement is necessary. LESS offers a very good cosmetic effect, which can be an attribute of the single-site approach. LESS radical nephrectomy makes it possible to perform efficient and safe kidney excision and seems to be a valuable alternative to classic surgery in properly selected cases...|$|R

The Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS) for incontinence and the Altomare ODS score were determined preoperatively. Follow-up examinations were performed after 14 days, one month and 6 months, at this time both scores were reevaluated. Results: 110 consecutive patients (71 women, 39 men) with a mean age of 59. 7 years (± 13. 8 years) were included in the study. The eight participating institutes entered 3 to 31 patients each into the study. The indication for surgery was an advanced hemorrhoidal disease in 55 patients and ODS with rectal intussusception or rectocele in 55 patients. <b>Mechanical</b> problems with <b>stapler</b> introduction occurred in (20 %) and a partial stapleline dehiscence in 4 cases (3. 6 %). Additional stitches for bleeding from stapleline were necessary in (78. 2 %). Reintervention was necessary for bleeding 7 times (6. 3 %). Severe complications during follow-up were stapleline dehiscence in one case and recurrent hemorrhoidal prolapse in 5 cases (4. 5 %). Altomare ODS score and CCIS improved significantly after surgery. Conclusions: Despite a notable complication rate during surgery and the postoperative period, the TST 36 can be considered as an effective tool for low rectal stapling for anorectal prolapse causing hemorrhoids or obstructed defecation...|$|R
