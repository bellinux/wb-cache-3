5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political <b>machine</b> <b>run</b> by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E
25|$|The 68000 {{and video}} {{controller}} took turns accessing DRAM every four CPU cycles during {{display of the}} frame buffer, while the 68000 had unrestricted access to DRAM during vertical and horizontal blanking intervals. Such an arrangement reduced the overall performance of the CPU as much as 35% for most code as the display logic often blocked the CPU's access to RAM. This made the <b>machine</b> <b>run</b> more slowly than several of its competitors, despite the nominally high clock rate.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Philadelphia had taken on a poor reputation. People both inside and outside of the city commented that Philadelphia and its citizens were dull and contented with its lack of change. Harper's Magazine commented that [...] "The one thing unforgivable in Philadelphia is to be new, to be different from what has been." [...] Along with an image of [...] "dullness," [...] Philadelphia was known for its political corruption. The Republican-controlled political <b>machine,</b> <b>run</b> by Israel Durham, permeated all parts of city government. One official estimated that US$5 million was wasted each year from graft in the city's infrastructure programs. The majority of residents were Republican, but voter fraud and bribery were still common. In 1905 the city enacted election reforms, such as personal voter registration and the establishing primaries for all city offices. But, residents became complacent, and the city's political bosses continued in control. After 1907 Boss Durham retired and his successor, James McNichol, never controlled much outside North Philadelphia. The Vare brothers, George, Edwin, and William, had created their own organization in South Philadelphia. [...] With no central authority, Senator Boies Penrose took charge. In 1910 infighting between McNichol and the Vares contributed to the reform candidate, Rudolph Blankenburg, to be elected mayor. During his administration, he made numerous cost-cutting measures and improvements to city services, but he served only one term. [...] The machine again gained control.|$|E
40|$|We show that, for all {{reasonable}} functions T(n) =o(n n), we can algorithmically verify {{whether a}} given one-tape Turing <b>machine</b> <b>runs</b> in time at most T(n). This is a tight bound {{on the order}} of growth for the function T because we prove that, for T(n) ≥(n+ 1) and T(n) =Ω(n n), there exists no algorithm that would verify whether a given one-tape Turing <b>machine</b> <b>runs</b> in time at most T(n). We give results also for the case of multi-tape Turing machines. We show that we can verify whether a given multi-tape Turing <b>machine</b> <b>runs</b> in time at most T(n) iff T(n_ 0) < (n_ 0 + 1) for some n_ 0 ∈N. We prove a very general undecidability result stating that, for any class of functions F that contains arbitrary large constants, we cannot verify whether a given Turing <b>machine</b> <b>runs</b> in time T(n) for some T∈F. In particular, we cannot verify whether a Turing <b>machine</b> <b>runs</b> in constant, polynomial or exponential time. Comment: 18 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

In 1920, he won a full term as judge by defeating the candidate of a local political <b>machine</b> <b>run</b> by his intra-party rival John Dymond. Perez was elected district attorney in 1924 and became involved {{in a dispute over}} trapping lands; this ended in a shootout known as the [...] "Trappers' War."

2500|$|In {{the same}} {{converted}} hangar that housed ZETA was the Harwell Synchrocyclotron effort run by Basil Rose. This project had also constructed a sensitive high-pressure diffusion cloud chamber as the cyclotron's main detector. Rose was convinced {{it would be}} able to directly measure the neutron energies and trajectories. In a series of experiments, he showed that the neutrons had a high directionality, at odds with a fusion origin which would be expected to be randomly directed. To further demonstrate this he had the <b>machine</b> <b>run</b> [...] "backwards", with the electric current running in the opposite direction. This demonstrated a clear difference in the number of neutrons and their energy, which suggested they were a result of the electrical current itself, not fusion reactions inside the plasma.|$|E
2500|$|By 1927, the Los Angeles Times was openly {{critical}} {{of the relationship between}} Parrot and Cryer, referring to Cryer as Parrot's [...] "personal mayor". [...] Though the Times had been a strong backer of Cryer, the paper in 1927 published an editorial referring to the city government as [...] "Our Local Tammany", a reference to Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall machine that controlled New York politics in the 19th Century. [...] The article ignored Cryer and focused its attack on the [...] "clumsy" [...] corruption of the political <b>machine</b> <b>run</b> by [...] "Boss Parrot":"Evidently Boss Parrot's subordinates are not well trained. [...] Give him a few more years in control and he will, perhaps, do better. [...] He must learn to think up plausible reasons for the actions of the organization and not let the purely political motive stick out like a sore thumb. [...] Perhaps he thinks the voters of Los Angeles are so lacking in intelligence that this is unnecessary; if so, he is mistaken. [...] It does not pay to be so raw anywhere." ...|$|E
