5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The <b>main</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

Many refugees tried to return home when the fighting ended. [...] Before 1 June 1945, 400,000 people crossed back over the Oder and Neisse rivers eastward, before Soviet and Polish communist authorities closed the river crossings; another 800,000 entered Silesia through Czechoslovakia.|$|E
