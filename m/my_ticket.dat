2500|$|Howard {{began to}} develop an {{interest}} in acting {{to the point where}} his grades worsened and began to play hookey from school. He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me.

During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: [...] "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences."

60|$|My steamer sailed at {{two o'clock}} the next day, and after an early breakfast I went to the company's office to see if I could dispose of <b>my</b> <b>ticket.</b> It had become impossible, I told the agent, {{for me to leave}} America at present.

6000|$|... "Ah! {{some one}} in the train spoke of {{sickness}} at Wil'sbro', but I would ask no questions, for I saw faces I knew, and I would lead to no recognition.
