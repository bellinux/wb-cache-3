The system is mainly mechanical, using a pump to provide additional pressure in the diagonally linked dampers (shock absorber) during cornering, to counteract rolling and pitching. The system can dynamically adjust the stiffness at each damper constantly to maintain both a comfortable ride and high grip. On this version, it has a three-way level control, selectable from the Multi <b>Media</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{analysis}} {{has been exploited}} by attackers to threaten user privacy in wireless networks. As an example, a user’s online activities may be exposed to strangers, even if the traffic is encrypted. However, the existing defense mechanisms against traffic analysis, such as packet padding and traffic morphing, are inefficient because they add noise traffic to blur the traffic features, therefore introducing significant overhead. In this paper, we propose the traffic reshaping technique to thwart traffic analysis. It creates multiple virtual <b>media</b> access <b>control</b> (MAC) <b>interfaces</b> over a single wireless card, dynamically schedules packets over these interfaces, thereby reshaping the packet features on each virtual interface. Hence, features of the original traffic are obscured and unavailable for the adversary to infer users’ online activities. Unlike the existing solutions, traffic reshaping enhances privacy protection without incurring overhead in items of adding noise traffic. We evaluate the performance of traffic reshaping through trace based experiments. The results show that traffic reshaping is effective and efficient in defending against the traffic analysis attacks...|$|R
40|$|IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{known for}} its {{prominent}} service delivery is paving way for applications like Video Voice over IP (VVOIP) on handheld devices too. Android, a software platform from Google, pioneering in middleware and applications domain of handheld devices does not offer support for IMS services by design. Motivated by these observations, we present novel scalable architecture to cater IMS based services on Android. First, we discuss few related works to investigate and analyze the IMS {{and the role of}} SIP in IMS services. Second, we discuss few characteristics of android architecture and detail constraints associated with middleware sub-system to cater IMS services. Consequently, we describe the proposed architecture addressing inherent challenges like QoS, Extendibility and Security encountered while offering IMS based services. The architectural framework design reduces time-to-deployment by using a layered approach encompassing three layers, namely: QoE Engine, Advanced IMS Service Core (A-IMS) and Application Services Engine (ASE). The A-IMS core is responsible to provide End- 2 -End efficient service delivery of IMS services like VOIP. We point out the benefits of using the ASE and generic <b>media</b> management and <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> (GMMCI) to ensure smooth and swift portability onto different flavors of android. Finally, we conclude by detailing some use-cases of future IMS services like Video Sharing/Video Recording in an on-going Video Telephony Call...|$|R
40|$|Active movement-assistive devices aim to {{increase}} {{the quality of life}} for patients with neuromusculoskeletal disorders. This technology requires interaction between the user and the device through a <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> that detects the user’s movement intention. Researchers have explored a wide variety of invasive and non-invasive <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> To summarize the wide spectrum of strategies, this paper presents a comprehensive review focused on non-invasive <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> used to operate active movement-assistive devices. A novel systematic classification method is proposed to categorize the <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> based on: (I) the source of the physiological signal, (II) the physiological phenomena responsible for generating the signal, and (III) the sensors used to measure the physiological signal. The proposed classification method can successfully categorize all the existing <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> providing a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Each sensing modality is briefly described in the body of the paper following the same structure used in the classification method. Furthermore, we discuss several design considerations, challenges, and future directions of non-invasive <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> for active movement-assistive devices.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the usability benefits of adding a bedside central <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> that <b>controls</b> all intravenous (IV) infusion pumps compared to the conventional individual control of multiple infusion pumps. Eighteen dedicated ICU nurses volunteered in a between-subjects task-based usability test. A newly developed central <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> was compared to conventional control of multiple infusion pumps in a simulated ICU setting. Task execution time, clicks, errors and questionnaire responses were evaluated. Overall the central <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> outperformed the conventional control in terms of fewer user actions (40 +/- 3 vs. 73 +/- 20 clicks, p < 0. 001) and fewer user errors (1 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 2 errors, p < 0. 05), with no difference in task execution times (421 +/- 108 vs. 406 +/- 119 seconds, not significant). Questionnaires indicated a significant preference for the central <b>control</b> <b>interface.</b> Despite being novice users of the central <b>control</b> <b>interface,</b> ICU nurses displayed improved performance with the central <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> compared to the conventional interface they were familiar with.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand how people adapt to errors when using a myoelectric <b>control</b> <b>interface.</b> We compared adaptation across 1) non-amputee subjects using joint angle, joint torque, and myoelectric <b>control</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and 2) amputee subjects using myoelectric <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> with residual and intact limbs (five total <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> conditions). We measured trial-by-trial adaptation to self-generated errors and random perturbations during a virtual, single degree-of-freedom task with two levels of feedback uncertainty, and evaluated adaptation by fitting a hierarchical Kalman filter model. We have two main results. First, adaptation to random perturbations was similar across all <b>control</b> <b>interfaces,</b> whereas adaptation to self-generated errors differed. These patterns matched predictions of our model, which was fit to each <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> by changing the process noise parameter that represented system variability. Second, in amputee subjects, we found similar adaptation rates and error levels between residual and intact limbs. These results link prosthesis control to broader areas of motor learning and adaptation and provide a useful model of adaptation with myoelectric control. The model of adaptation will help us understand and solve prosthesis control challenges, such as providing additional sensory feedback...|$|R

40|$|Rolls-Royce Marine is {{currently}} developing a semi-autonomous cargo vessel. The semi-autonomous cargo ship operation is a supervisory control task, {{in which the}} human operator is receiving information from a remote semi-autonomous vessel and instructing it through supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Thus, {{it is necessary to}} have supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> to carry the operation. But, the design guidelines for the interfaces are unclear, {{because of the lack of}} semi-autonomous cargo ships. The thesis presents design guidelines for developing supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> for the semi-autonomous cargo vessel. The research question answered in this thesis is: “How to design a supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> for remote semi-autonomous cargo vessel system to enable intuitive and precise instruction of the course plan?” The author answers the question through a research and design process that consists of the problem and solution spaces. The problem space suggests design requirements through a literature review and experts interviews. The literature review gives contextual and theoretical knowledge to design supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The expert interviews with video gamers and autonomous ship experts present potential user needs and design considerations. The findings from the problem space combine and formulate design requirements. The solution space ideates and prototypes a supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interface</b> prototype by applying the design requirements. The prototype has been evaluated in usability tests with sailors and autonomous ship expert. The findings from the usability tests are linked to the design requirements to evaluate how the designed solution fulfils design requirements. The thesis contributes to the design of semi-autonomous cargo vessel supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> by answering to the research question. In the conclusion part, the author answer to the research question by suggesting three design themes, which are synthetics of the design requirements and analysis. The design themes are: providing situation awareness, intuitive manipulation, and collaborative control. With these design themes designers will be able to develop supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which present intuitive and precise course planning capability to the operators. At the same time, the findings of the thesis will provide several directions for further research, such as researching an unmanned surface vehicle supervisory <b>control</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adults with DMD {{can benefit}} from active arm {{supports}} that augment their residual functional capabilities. However, intuitively controlled and fully actuated arm supports are currently not commercially available and adults with DMD are limited to use external robotic arms which contribute to the disuse of their arms. To fill this gap {{in the field of}} arm supports, we have developed EMGand force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> that have been implemented in two new active arm supports: the A-Arm and the Active A-Gear. We found that both EMGand force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> are feasible solutions for the control of active arm support for adults with DMD that have lost their arm function a long time ago. The comparative studies between EMG and force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> indicated that, in general, EMG-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> are better suited for adults with DMD than force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> as they are experienced as less fatiguing. Nevertheless, force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> with active gravity and joint-stiffness compensation can be a better alternative for those cases in which voluntary forces would still be higher than the intrinsic forces of the arms. This conclusion has an indicative value, as it is based on a low number of subjects. In any case, the decision on the most suited interface will have to be taken based on the specificities of each subject. In conclusion, by developing these new <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> and implementing them in new active assistive devices, we made a significant step in improving arm supports for adults with DMD. Hopefully, these novel concepts of arm supports will be the basis for the development of commercially available active arm supports for people with severe muscular weakness. The control and assistive strategies developed in the Flextension A-Gear project may be applicable to other patient groups with muscular weakness...|$|R

40|$|Powered {{prostheses}} {{are controlled}} using electromyographic (EMG) signals, which may introduce {{high levels of}} uncertainty even for simple tasks. According to Bayesian theories, higher uncertainty should influence how the brain adapts motor commands in response to perceived errors. Such adaptation may critically influence how patients interact with their prosthetic devices; however, {{we do not yet}} understand adaptation behavior with EMG control. Models of adaptation can offer insights on movement planning and feedback correction, but we first need to establish their validity for EMG <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Here we created a simplified comparison of prosthesis and able-bodied control by studying adaptation with three control interfaces: joint angle, joint torque, and EMG. Subjects used each of the <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> to perform a target-directed task with random visual perturbations.

The crucial question posed is, {{what is the nature of}} interface designs sought by end-users for maximising interaction with lighting control systems? The manner in which this question is posed implies a fundamental assumption that improved usability and end-user experience are the primary goals. The concept of end-user understanding of lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> is proposed as a basis for improving the usability and end-user experience of lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Usability engineering methods involving survey research, experimental mock-ups and prototyping have been used to enable end-users to design and evaluate lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The essential difference is to include end-users' point of view about ease of understanding control functions and pleasure of performing control tasks along with a technical point of view about meeting required standards. Manufacturers' claims about the effectiveness of existing lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> are challenged, and an entirely different way of thinking about interface design is revealed.
