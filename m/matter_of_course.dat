This was not achieved through a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> but through a constant campaign of organised pressure. The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), taking on a broader range of issues to secure more widespread support.|$|E
5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, and as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> made many enemies.|$|E

25|$|In the West, {{the idea}} came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with Hellenistic civilization. Many Roman authors such as Cicero and Pliny refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E

25|$|Peled's first direct {{involvement}} in a political party was in 1977 with {{the foundation of the}} short-lived Left Camp of Israel party, whose platform focused on advocating peace negotiations with the Palestinians.

60|$|The hotel, a squat, battlemented wooden building, was {{trimmed with}} loafing cowboys {{on the outside}} and {{speckled}} with flies on the inside, but the landlord was unexpectedly attractive, a smiling, courteous host, to whom flies and cowboys were <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> It was plain he had slipped down to his present low level by insensible declinations.|$|R
60|$|Whatever {{he might}} feel, prison {{regulations}} were accepted by him as <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> not worth {{being treated as}} separate grievances.

25|$|Even if the guardsmen faced danger, {{it was not}} {{a danger}} that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen {{certainly}} cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of the spherical {{shape of}} the Earth was {{received}} in scholarship of Late Antiquity as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> in both Neoplatonism and Early Christianity. Calcidius's fourth-century Latin commentary on and translation of Plato's Timaeus, {{which was one of}} the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages, discussed Hipparchus's use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the relative diameters of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1970s {{to the early}} 1990s many Americans assumed as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> that students' {{self-esteem}} acted as {{a critical factor in}} the grades that they earn in school, in their relationships with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.|$|E

25|$|The West Syrian Rite, used in Syria by the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites) and Catholic Syrians is in {{its origin}} simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language. The {{translation}} must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over Chalcedon, before the influence of Constantinople over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose {{in the rural areas}} of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> translated into Syriac for common use.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous {{adaptation}} are adaptations {{that are}} reactive to climatic stimuli, and are {{done as a}} <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> without the intervention of a public agency. Planned adaptation can be reactive or anticipatory, i.e., undertaken before impacts are apparent. Some studies suggest that human systems have considerable capacity to adapt autonomously (Smit et al., 2001:890). Others point to constraints on autonomous adaptation, such as limited information and access to resources (p.890). Smit et al. (2001:904) concluded that relying on autonomous {{adaptation to climate change}} would result in substantial ecological, social, and economic costs. In their view, these costs could largely be avoided with planned adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) were persecuted {{and imprisoned}} by Russian forces as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> Most victims were {{deported}} to the gulags in the Donetsk region. In 1945 alone, {{the number of}} members of the Polish Underground State who were deported to Siberia and various labor camps in the Soviet Union reached 50,000. Units of the Red Army carried out campaigns against Polish partisans and civilians. During the Augustów chase in 1945, more than 2,000 Poles were captured and about 600 of them are presumed to have died in Soviet custody.

60|$|Three men-servants met {{the guests}} in the hall, and Mrs. Charteris {{received}} {{them in the}} drawing-room, with the woman-of-the-world tact that Honora particularly hated; there was always such deference to Miss Charlecote, and such an assumption of affection for the children, and gratitude for her care of them, and Miss Charlecote had not been an heiress early enough in life for such attentions to seem <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Prendergast {{was less}} pleased after than before this promise. It was again that freedom of {{expression}} that the girl had learnt among the Charterises, and the ideas that she accepted as mere <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> that jarred upon the matron, whose secluded life had preserved her in far truer refinement. She {{did not know how}} to reply, and, as a means of ending the discussion, gave her Mr. Prendergast's letter, but was amazed at her reception of it.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes the Serbian {{authorities}} {{cooperated with}} the Germans as <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> whereas others took individual initiative; some Serbian military commanders rounded-up Gypsies {{so they could be}} concentrated in one area, where they were shot. German occupiers declared Serbia Judenfrei in August 1942. The major concentration camps in Serbia were Sajmište and Banjica but many others like Topovske Supe, Schabatz, and Nisch concentration camps also interned considerable numbers of Jews. Before the war was concluded, upwards of 14,500 Serbian Jews were murdered. Legends about Serbs saving the Jews in World War II are widespread in Serbia, and 132 Serbs have been honored as righteous Gentiles.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 2011, the Law of Return {{was tested}} when a gay male couple, one Jewish and one Catholic made Aliyah to Israel. This couple {{was the first}} same-sex, {{different}} religion married couple to request joint Aliyah Status, although opposite sex married couples of different religions receive joint Aliyah as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> The Jewish man quickly received citizenship but the decision of citizenship for his husband was delayed by the Ministry of the Interior despite the clause in the law saying the spouse of the Jewish returnee must also be granted citizenship. On August 10, 2011, the Ministry of the Interior granted citizenship to the non-Jewish husband as required by The Law of Return.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina {{no longer}} {{requires}} attorneys to be licensed separately to plead in a courtroom. Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys {{to obtain a}} separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.|$|E
