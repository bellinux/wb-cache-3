500|$|Fans of Day of the Tentacle {{created a}} webcomic, The Day After the Day of the Tentacle, using the game's graphics. The 1993 LucasArts title Zombies Ate <b>My</b> <b>Neighbors</b> {{features}} a stage dedicated to Day of the Tentacle. The artists for Day of the Tentacle shared office space with the Zombies Ate <b>My</b> <b>Neighbors</b> development team. The team included the homage after frequently seeing artwork for Day of the Tentacle {{during the two}} games' productions. In describing what he considered [...] "the most rewarding moment" [...] of his career, Grossman stated that the game's writing and use of spoken and subtitled dialog assisted a learning-disabled child in learning how to read. Telltale Games CEO Dan Connors commented in 2009 that an episodic game based on Day of the Tentacle would be [...] "feasible". However, he cautioned that such an endeavor would hinge on the sales of the Monkey Island titles released that year.|$|E
500|$|When it {{was seen}} that NVA forces were pouring through the gap unimpeded, the no-fire zone was reduced at 10:00p.m. that night, but not before the action {{generated}} considerable debate. One ranking adviser commented, [...] "When viewed in relation to all {{the events of the}} day, a worse decision could not have been made." [...] The 3rd ARVN had lost most of its artillery in the first two days of the offensive, and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to the NVA. Hambleton commented after the war, [...] "If the taxpayers and <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> knew what it cost to pull me out of there, they'd probably shoot me." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E

500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School down! I can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education of <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys. Something worse than vouchers could come along. If it works, if it sacrifices the entire school system, fine! Get rid of the damn thing! It hasn't worked!" [...] His suggestion caused uproar in the community, and his remarks were heavily criticized. Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Sévérine's death sequence was primarily negative. Dunt criticized Bond's comment following Sévérine's death - [...] "Waste of good Whiskey" [...] - as [...] "brutish and uncaring". Jade Budowski of The Tribeca Film Institute described {{the scene as}} [...] "unpalatable", and wrote that she [...] "sense it in the shifting of some of <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the theater," [...] specifically after the delivery of Bond's line. She argued that the sequence returned to the franchise's earlier treatment of women as [...] "expendable figures" [...] viewing them only as [...] "sex objects, eye candy, and plot devices". Berlatsky argued that Bond's reaction was just a [...] "callous joke" [...] and Sévérine existed {{for the sole purpose}} of [...] "lend weight to Craig's perspicuity, sexiness, and imperviousness". Paste's Kenneth Lowe found Bond's behavior toward women to be negative, citing Sévérine's death as a prominent example.|$|E
500|$|... "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from the group's third studio album, On Top (1966), in February 1966. The album {{was a combination of}} [...] "current hits" [...] and [...] "crossover material" [...] to attract a larger audience for Four Tops. The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, who had collaborated with Four Tops on various occasions in the past. It is written in the key of C major with the quartet's vocals ranging from G4 to D6. Set in a gospel rock tempo, lead single Levi Stubbs begins stating, [...] "All through this long and sleepless night / I hear <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> talking"; after losing the love of someone else, he claims that these people are [...] "Saying that, out of my life, into another's arms / You'll soon be walking," [...] before entering the chorus. The American female group the Andantes provide background vocals for the track.|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work. In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is when I began to write a novel. <b>My</b> <b>neighbors</b> simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|TO THE PUBLIC: Whereas {{reports have}} been industriously put in {{circulation}} {{that my son}} Alvin {{had been removed from}} the place of his interment and dissected; which reports ... are peculiarly calculated to harrow up the mind of a parent and deeply wound the feelings of relations ... therefore, for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of such reports, I, with some of <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> this morning, repaired to the grave, and removing the earth, found the body, which had not been disturbed. This method is taken for the purpose of satisfying the minds of those who may have heard the report, and of informing those who have put it in circulation, that it is earnestly requested they would desist therefrom.|$|E
2500|$|Barnum enjoyed what he {{publicly}} dubbed [...] "profitable philanthropy." [...] In Barnum's own words: [...] "I have {{no desire}} to be considered much of a philanthropist...if by improving and beautifying our city Bridgeport, Connecticut, and adding to the pleasure and prosperity of <b>my</b> <b>neighbors,</b> I can do so at a profit, the incentive to 'good works' will be twice as strong as if it were otherwise." [...] In line with this philosophy was Barnum's pursuit of major American museums and spectacles. Less known are Barnum's significant contributions to Tufts University. Barnum was appointed to the Board of Trustees prior to the University's founding and made several significant contributions to the fledgling institution. The most noteworthy example of this was his gift in 1883 of $50,000 ($2,000,000 in 2013), to establish a museum and hall for the Department of Natural History, which today houses the department of biology. Because of the relationship between Barnum and Tufts, Jumbo the elephant became the school's mascot, and Tufts students are known as [...] "Jumbos." ...|$|E
