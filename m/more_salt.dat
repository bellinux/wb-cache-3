5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. <b>More</b> <b>salt</b> is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is {{much less than the}} relict salt from Bonneville.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey of}} the pits that have {{previously}} been used to grow Swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis), (known in Tuvalu as Pulaka) established that the pits were either too saline or very marginal for swamp taro production, although a <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> tolerant species of taro (Colocasia esculenta) is grown on Fongafale.|$|E

50|$|Quality {{of water}} {{can also be}} diminished / altered/ {{controlled}} in the action of using water. It would take place by accumulating the dissolved salts in the remaining water after its use. The dissolved salts content of water increases due to its consumption and also addition of <b>more</b> <b>salts</b> by anthropogenic activity. Also causing water more silt laden / turbid is a man made water quality alteration which {{can be caused by}} mining and deforestation activities. Bringing water from other river basins for upstream states use also effects water quality in downstream states.|$|R
25|$|Lanthanide metals react exothermically with {{hydrogen}} to form LnH2, dihydrides. With {{the exception}} of Eu and Yb which resemble the Ba and Ca hydrides (non conducting, transparent salt like compounds) they form black pyrophoric, conducting compounds where the metal sub-lattice is face centred cubic and the H atoms occupy tetrahedral sites. Further hydrogenation produces a trihydride which is non-stoichiometric, non-conducting, <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> like. The formation of trihydride is associated with and increase in 8–10% volume and this is linked to greater localisation of charge on the hydrogen atoms which become more anionic (H− hydride anion) in character.|$|E
500|$|There is <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> {{in animal}} tissues, such as meat, blood, and milk, than in plant tissues. Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds {{do not eat}} salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and {{vegetable}} matter, need to supplement their diet with salt. With the spread of civilization, salt {{became one of the}} world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement, and the ancient Hebrews made a [...] "covenant of salt" [...] with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him. An ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth: scattering salt around in a defeated city to prevent plant growth. The Bible tells the story of King Abimelech who was ordered by God to do this at Shechem, and various texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War (146 BC).|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{has been}} a medical tourism {{destination}} in the Middle East since the 1970s. A study conducted by Jordan's Private Hospitals Association found that 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in Jordan in 2010, compared to 190,000 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue. Jordan is the region's top medical tourism destination, as rated by the World Bank, and fifth in the world overall. The majority of patients come from Yemen, Libya and Syria due to the ongoing civil wars in those countries. Jordanian doctors and medical staff have gained experience in dealing with war patients through years of receiving such cases from various conflict zones in the region. [...] Jordan also is a hub for natural treatment methods in both Ma'in Hot Springs and the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea {{is often described as}} a 'natural spa'. It contains 10 times <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> than the average ocean, which makes it impossible to sink in. The high salt concentration of the Dead Sea has been proved as being therapeutic for many skin diseases. The uniqueness of this lake attracts several Jordanian and foreign vacationers, which boosted investments in the hotel sector in the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of marginal water resources for agriculture is receiving considerable attention. The lands irrigated with saline water {{are required to}} reduce salt accumulations through leaching and/or drainage practices. A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of saline irrigation and leaching fraction on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) growth. For this purpose highly saline water was diluted to the salinity levels of 3, 6 and 9 dS m- 1 and applied by drip irrigation at 0. 0, 0. 15, 0. 20 and 0. 25 leaching fractions (LF). The results of the experiment showed that both {{quantity and quality of}} water regulated salts distribution within the soil in the following manner: a) the salts were found higher near or immediate below the soil surface; b) an enhanced LF carried <b>more</b> <b>salts</b> down the soil horizon but {{there was no significant difference}} in plant yield between different treatments of leaching fractions. Salinity of water significantly impaired barley growth. The good drainage of sandy soil enhanced the leaching process and minimized the differences between leaching fractions. The increment in saline treatments (3, 6 and 9 dS m- 1) added <b>more</b> <b>salts</b> and stressed plant growth. However, the conjunctive use of marginal water at proportional LF could be effective in enhancing the yield potential of crops in water-scarce areas...|$|R
25|$|Salinity {{is another}} {{important}} water quality issue. Drainage return flows to the Nile result {{in an increase in}} salinity of the water from 250 ppm (mg/l) at Aswan to 2,700 ppm at the Delta barrages. However, <b>more</b> <b>salts</b> are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea than are entering at Aswan (see Irrigation for agriculture in Egypt) so {{that in the long run}} the salinity of the water at the Delta barrages could decrease. However, saline groundwater of marine origin enters the Delta through pumping of brackish water and upwelling in lakes and drains, thus counterbalancing this effect.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson {{contends that}} the ACP's public {{statements}} often do not match the findings of their studies. He argues that studies by Delft Hydraulics, WPSI Inc., and DHI all say that the proposed water-saving basins will allow <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> water into Gatun Lake, from which about half of Panama's population takes its drinking water. The ACP says that the problem can be reduced by [...] "flushing" [...] the new locks with fresh water from Gatun Lake, but this would defeat the water-saving feature.|$|E
2500|$|A supertaster is {{a person}} whose sense of taste is {{significantly}} more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae. Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food {{to get the same}} satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume <b>more</b> <b>salt</b> than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.) ...|$|E
