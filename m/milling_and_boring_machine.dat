40|$|It was {{reported}} in the previous report that the propagation constant measuring system for long distance pipelines was produced based upon the distribution constant theory for the purpose of maintenance and management of long distance pipelines buried underground and to have a system to directly measure the propagation constants and characteristic impedance of the pipeline buried underground. This time, a simulator for the signal propagation of a pipeline, referring to these actual measurement values, was constructed and various signal modes were simulated. On the prediction of accidents where heavy-construction equipment, such as backhoe or <b>boring</b> <b>machine,</b> has contact with a pipeline and damages the coating of pipeline, the damage simulations with a backhoe <b>and</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> were performed <b>and</b> the fault resistances of these heavy-construction pieces of equipment at the time of accidents were identified. As a result, it was revealed that the fault resistance generated by the metal-to-metal contact caused by the <b>boring</b> <b>machine,</b> which damages pipeline the most, was approximately 20 - 50 Ω when water was used, and that caused by the backhoe was approximately 100 Ω. In order to verify the detectable property of this system, a simulation was performed to determine how each distributed constant changed when this degree of grounding faults occurred in the monitoring section of the pipeline, and validated it with an actual pipeline...|$|R

40|$|Background The accurate, {{efficient}} and economical monitoring of settlements caused by tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines,</b> especially in regions {{of particular interest}} such as critical inner city areas, has become {{an important aspect of}} the tunnelling operation. Besides conventional terrestrial based methods to capture settlements, satellite based techniques that can accurately determine displacements remotely, are increasingly being used to augment standard terrestrial measurements. However, not much {{attention has been paid to}} analyse the accuracy of satellite based measurement data. In addition, there is also a lack of studies on how to visualise the resulting huge amount of data in the context of both the tunnel advancement and the existing building infrastructure. Methods This paper introduces the basics of settlement monitoring using radar interferometry methods, in particular showing the results obtained by processing radar images from the TerraSAR-X satellite to monitor a downtown construction site in Düsseldorf, Germany, where a new underground line (“Wehrhahn-Linie”) is being built. By comparing terrestrial measurements with remote satellite based settlement data in temporal and spatial corridors, the accuracy of the radar interferometry method is shown. Moreover, a 4 D visualisation concept is presented that correlates satellite and terrestrial based settlement data correlated with above-ground buildings <b>and</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> performance parameters within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. Results By comparing up to 23, 000 pairs of satellite and terrestrial based settlement data points of a real tunnelling project an accuracy of about ± 1. 5 mm in the measurement of deformation using the method of radar interferometry in urban areas can be stated. In addition, providing a visual analysis of data sources within a VR environment, the accuracy of terrestrial and satellite-based measurements can be visualised in different time steps. Sources of error that affect the degree of accuracy, such as atmospheric conditions, systematic errors in the evaluation of radar images and local events in the spatial corridor, can be quantified. In addition, the 4 D visualisation can help reveal direct interdependencies between settlement data <b>and</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> performance data. Conclusions The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) based on high resolution radar images of the TerraSAR-X satellite, in combination with conventional ground-based terrestrial measurements, provides a new settlement monitoring approach in tunnelling. For example, due to minimized surveying works and disruptions of construction activities on site and due to the large settlement area coming with a high magnitude of settlement data points, this combined monitoring approach is very practical and economical. Moreover, by visualizing the settlement data properly, the risk of damage of surface structures can be analysed and understood more precisely, which increases the safety of underground works...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although {{the high}} damping alloy M 2052, {{which has been}} {{developed}} 10 years go, possesses both of very high damping capacity and excellent workability, {{it has been used}} only in the field of an audio/video field. If this alloy will be produced by combining high-quality raw material and optimum manufacturing processes, the damping capacity of 0. 72 in logarithmic decrement that is near to that of rubber can be yielded. In addition, since workability is very excellent, the sizes and shapes of parts required for anti-vibration measures can be easily supplied, thus being able to satisfy to create all sorts of items necessary for the design of the measures. In this paper, we show how to use this alloy and some examples of application: a multi-axis with non-rotating grinding <b>machine,</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machines,</b> a surface grinder, coiled springs, and an installation mount. Many of excellent effects of damping provided by the applications such as an insert, a carpet, and a variety of new ideas to decrease a spring constant of parts suggest possibility to solve the hard problem which was not solved by rubber.
