5|$|After the war, Oliphant {{returned}} to Australia {{as the first}} Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University, where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 <b>megajoule)</b> homopolar generator. He retired in 1976, but was appointed Governor of South Australia {{on the advice of}} Premier, Don Dunstan. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} unit of {{measurement}} on the electricity meter is the kilowatt hour , which {{is equal to the}} amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI <b>megajoule</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{gunpowder}} contains 3 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram, dynamite contains 7.5 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram, {{and gasoline}} contains 47.2 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram (though gasoline requires an oxidant, so an optimized gasoline and O2 mixture contains 10.4 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram).|$|R

25|$|Direct drive: In this technique, lasers {{directly}} blast a pellet of fuel. The goal is {{to ignite}} a fusion chain reaction. Ignition was first suggested by John Nuckolls, in 1972. Notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, Laser <b>Mégajoule</b> and the GEKKO XII facilities. Good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward shock wave that produces the high-density plasma.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Roadster's battery-to-wheel motor {{efficiency}} was reported as 88% to 90% on average and 80% at peak power. For comparison, internal combustion engines have a tank-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%. Taking {{a more complete}} picture including the cost of energy drawn from its source, Tesla reports that their technology, assuming electricity generated from natural gas-burning power plants, has a high well-to-wheel efficiency of 1.14 kilometers per <b>megajoule,</b> compared to 0.202km/MJ for gasoline-powered sports cars, 0.478km/MJ for gasoline-powered commuter cars, 0.556km/MJ for hybrid cars, and 0.348km/MJ for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.|$|E
25|$|When Nova {{was being}} {{dismantled}} {{to make way}} for NIF, the target chamber was lent to France for temporary use during the development of Laser <b>Megajoule,</b> a system similar to NIF in many ways. This loan was controversial, as the only other operational laser at LLNL at the time, Beamlet (a single experimental beamline for NIF), had recently been sent to Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico. This left LLNL with no large laser facility until NIF started operation, which was then estimated as being 2003 at the earliest. Work on NIF was not declared formally completed until March 31, 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Gunpowder {{releases}} 3 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram {{and contains}} its own oxidant. This {{is lower than}} TNT ( [...] 4.7 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram), or gasoline (47.2 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram, but gasoline requires an oxidant, so an optimized gasoline and O2 mixture contains 10.4 <b>megajoules</b> per kilogram). Black powder also has a low energy density compared to modern [...] "smokeless" [...] powders, and thus to achieve high energy loadings, large amounts of black powder are needed with heavy projectiles.|$|R
25|$|A common hardwood, red oak, has {{an energy}} content (heat value) of 14.9 <b>megajoules</b> per {{kilogram}} (6,388 BTU per pound), and 10.4 <b>megajoules</b> recoverable if burned at 70% efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{improvement of}} high-temperature electrolysis is best appreciated by {{assuming that the}} electricity used comes from a heat engine, and then considering the amount of heat energy necessary to produce one kg hydrogen (141.86 <b>megajoules),</b> both in the HTE process itself and also in producing the electricity used. At 100 °C, 350 <b>megajoules</b> of thermal energy are required (41% efficient). At 850 °C, 225 <b>megajoules</b> are required (64% efficient).|$|R
25|$|On January 26, 2009, {{the final}} line {{replaceable}} unit (LRU) was installed, completing one of the final major milestones of the NIF construction project and meaning that construction was unofficially completed. On February 26, 2009, {{for the first time}} NIF fired all 192 laser beams into the target chamber. On March 10, 2009, NIF became the first laser to break the <b>megajoule</b> barrier, firing all 192 beams and delivering 1.1 MJ of ultraviolet light, known as 3ω, to the target chamber center in a shaped ignition pulse. The main laser delivered 1.952 MJ of infrared energy.|$|E
25|$|The ANU College of Physical & Mathematical Sciences {{comprises}} the Research Schools of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physics. Under {{the direction of}} Mark Oliphant, nuclear physics was one the university's most notable early research priorities, leading {{to the construction of}} a 500 <b>megajoule</b> homopolar generator and a 7.7 megaelectronvolts cyclotron in the 1950s. These devices were to be used as part of a 10.6 gigaelectronvolt synchrotron particle accelerator that was never completed, however they remained in use for other research purposes. ANU has been home to eight particle accelerators over the years and operates the 14UD and LINAS accelerators. Brian Schmidt (astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo Observatory) received the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values (DRV), with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 1.6 mg niacin per <b>megajoule</b> (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 16 mg niacin. This is comparable to U.S. RDAs. The niacin UL is set at 10mg/day, which is much less than the U.S. value. The UL applies to niacin as a supplement consumed as one dose, and in intended to avoid the skin flush reaction. This explains why the PRI can be higher than the UL.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, a major {{article was}} {{published}} in Physics Today by Robert McCory at the Laboratory for laser energetics outlying {{the current state of}} ICF and advocating for a national ignition facility. This was followed up by a major review article, from John Lindl in 1995, advocating for NIF. During this time a number of ICF subsystems were developing, including target manufacturing, cryogenic handling systems, new laser designs (notably the NIKE laser at NRL) and improved diagnostics like time of flight analyzers and Thomson scattering. This work was done at the NOVA laser system, General Atomics, Laser <b>Mégajoule</b> and the GEKKO XII system in Japan. Through this work and lobbying by groups like the fusion power associates and John Sethian at NRL, a vote was made in congress, authorizing funding for the NIF project in the late nineties.|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{blocking}} sunscreen coatings {{have been}} developed for the protection of elastomer seals used in low-Earth-orbit (LEO). The coatings protect the seals from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and atomic oxygen (AO) damage. The coatings were developed for use on NASA docking seals. Docking seal damage from the UV and AO present in LEO can constrain mission time-line, flight mode options, and increases risk. A low level of adhesion is also required for docking seals so undocking push-off forces can be low. The coatings presented also mitigate this unwanted adhesion. Greases with low collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) and low total mass loss (TML) were mixed with slippery and/or UV blocking powders to create the protective coatings. Coatings were applied at rates up to 2 milligrams per square centimeter. Coated seals were exposed to AO and UV in the NUV (near-UV) and UV-C wavelength ranges (300 to 400 nanometers and 254 nanometers, respectively). Ground based ashers were used to simulate the AO of space. The Sun's UV energy was mimicked assuming a nose forward flight mode, resulting in an exposure rate of 2. 5 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter per day. Exposures between 0 and 147 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter (UV-C) and 245 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter (NUV) were accomplished. The protective coatings were durable, providing protection from UV after a simulated docking and undocking cycle. The level of protection begins to decline at coverage rates less than 0. 9 milligrams per square centimeter. The leakage of seals coated with Braycote plus 20 percent Z-cote ZnO sunscreen increased by a factor of 40 after moderate AO exposure; indicating that this coating might not be suitable due to AO intolerance. Seals coated with DC- 7 - 16. 4 percent Z-cote ZnO sunscreen were not significantly affected by combined doses of 2 x 10 (sup 21) atoms per square AO with 73 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter UV-C. Unprotected seals were significantly damaged at UV-C exposures of 0. 3 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter and DC- 7 - 16. 4 percent Z-cote coated seals were undamaged at all exposures up to the limits tested thus far which were 147 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter UV-C and 245 <b>megajoules</b> per square meter NUV. The coatings decreased adhesion sufficiently for docking seals at temperatures equal to or greater than - 8 degrees Centigrade thus offer a simple and inexpensive way to mitigate adhesion...|$|R

2500|$|In July, 2017, Defensetech {{reported}} that the Navy wants to push the Office of Naval Research's prototype railgun from a science experiment into useful weapon territory. The goal, according to Tom Beutner, head of Naval Air Warfare and Weapons for the ONR, is ten shots per minute at 32 megajoules. A 32 <b>megajoule</b> railgun shot is equivalent to about 23,600,000 foot-pounds, so a single 32 MJ shot has the same muzzle energy as about 200,000 [...]22 rounds being fired simultaneously. The target firing rate, 10 shots per minutes, is then equivalent to firing 2 million [...]22 rimfire rounds per minute. In more conventional power units, a 32 MJ shot every 6 s is a net power of 5.3 MW (or 5300 kW). If the railgun {{is assumed to be}} 20% efficient at turning electrical energy into kinetic energy, the ship's electrical supplies will need to provide about 25 MW for 60s.|$|E
