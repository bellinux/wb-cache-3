5|$|From 1998, I {{started coming}} across people who told <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had seen people change into a {{non-human}} form. It's an age-old {{phenomenon known as}} shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes.|$|E
5|$|When I {{first became}} alderman, {{there was a}} {{developer}} up here who felt very threatened by me. He hired a publicist to really go after me. Any time I talked about development without displacement, they would ream <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> went {{to the press and}} got some of the most vicious editorials published.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|When the Turkish {{authorities}} {{gave the}} orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant {{to a whole}} race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> made no particular attempt to conceal the fact.|$|E

25|$|Many women {{write to}} tell me that {{although}} their husbands may not like <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> do. It appears from the mail that the women have the say on what the household is watching.

Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.|$|E

'It will serve as a challenge for <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> do not know what they are saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.|$|E
25|$|We must refuse {{everything}} to the Jews as a nation and accord {{everything to}} Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

25|$|In 1946 {{he went to}} University of the Witwatersrand (more {{commonly}} known as Wits University) in Johannesburg {{with the help of}} a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that “To <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
