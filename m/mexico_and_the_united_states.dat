5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} dead trees from forests may cause {{problems}} locally for this species {{because it requires}} cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. This nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States)</b> are all signatories.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isidore was {{the ninth}} named storm {{and the second}} {{hurricane}} in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in September. The tropical cyclone peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, causing damage as well as four fatalities in Jamaica, Cuba, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern Gulf Coast as a Category4 hurricane, but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a track change that brought the storm over the Yucatán Peninsula for over a day, which significantly weakened the cyclone. Its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which fell across southeast Mexico and from the central United States Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad from Los Angeles reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877, Tucson in March 1880, El Paso in May 1881, {{and thus}} {{completed}} the second transcontinental railroad in December 1881. The portion in Arizona was originally {{largely in the}} Gadsden Purchase but the western part was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix. The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had gone into effect, and before {{the time of the}} Gadsden Purchase. The Santa Fe Railroad Company also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via Prescott, Winslow, Flagstaff and Kingman in August 1883.|$|E

Hurricane Allen was then the earliest Category5 hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the Caribbean Sea, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding in Mexico, which resulted in at least 38fatalities. Hurricane Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the Gulf of Mexico and not make landfall.|$|E

5|$|During 1977 the World Meteorological Organization {{decided to}} form a {{hurricane}} committee, which held its first meeting during May 1978 and {{took control of the}} Atlantic hurricane naming lists. During 1978 the Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps ordered NOAA administrator Robert White to cease the sole usage of female names for hurricanes. Robert White subsequently passed the order on to the Director of NHC Neil Frank, who attended the first meeting of the hurricane committee and requested that both men’s and women’s names be used for the Atlantic. The committee subsequently decided to accept the proposal and adopted five new lists of male and female names to be used the following year. The lists also contained several Spanish and French names, so that they could reflect the cultures and languages used within the Atlantic Ocean. After an agreement was reached between <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> six new sets of male/female names were implemented for the Eastern Pacific basin during 1978. A new list was also drawn up during the year for the Western Pacific and was implemented after Typhoon Bess and the 1979 tropical cyclone conference.|$|E
