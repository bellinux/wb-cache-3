50|$|<b>Methaniazide,</b> {{brand name}} Neotizide among others, is an {{antibiotic}} {{which is used}} in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is the mesylate (methanesulfonate) ester of isoniazid, which is also an antituberculosis drug but has comparatively been far more widely known and used. Isoniazid is a prodrug of isonicotinic acid, and acetylisoniazid, a metabolite of isoniazid, is a metabolic intermediate through which most of the isonicotinic acid is formed. <b>Methaniazide</b> features its mesylate ester at the same position as that of the acetyl ester in acetylisoniazid, and so <b>methaniazide</b> probably acts as a prodrug of isonicotinic acid similarly to isoniazid and acetylisoniazid. <b>Methaniazide</b> is used as the sodium salt.|$|E
50|$|Neothetazone is an {{antibiotic}} combination of <b>methaniazide</b> (neotizide) and thioacetazone which is or was previously {{used in the}} treatment of tuberculosis.

It has been implicated as a cause of gigantomastia in a single 1970 case report, and, along with D-penicilliamine, bucillamine, ciclosporin, and indinavir, is one of the only drugs to have been associated with gigantomastia.|$|E
