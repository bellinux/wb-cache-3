40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we analyze a <b>multirate</b> <b>time</b> {{integration}} method for systems of ordinary differential equations that present significantly different scales within {{the components of}} the model. We interpret the multirate method as a multiscale operator decomposition method and use this formulation to conduct both an a priori error analysis and a hybrid a priori – a posteriori error analysis. The hybrid analysis has the form of a computable a posteriori leading order expression and a provably-higher order a priori expression. Both analyses distinguish the effects of the discretization of each component from the effects of multirate solution. The effects on stability arising from the multirate solution are reflected in perturbations to certain associated adjoint operators...|$|R

Based on the power splitting (PS) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> (TS) receiver architectures, power splitting relaying (PSR) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> relaying (TSR) protocols at relay are studied. In order to investigate the effect of power allocations on two source nodes, power splitting coefficient and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor at relay on performance, the two proposed protocols are analyzed and the bit error rate (BER) expressions of end-to-end system are derived.

Since RF signals can carry both information and energy, it has recently attracted a lot of attention on research activities, especially on investigating simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [1 – 3]. In [4], an energy constrained relay node using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol was considered based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> and power splitting receiver architectures, respectively. Specifically, the authors investigated both the delay-limited and the non-delay-limited transmission and derived the analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity, respectively.

Based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> receiver architecture, the authors in [6] proposed adaptive <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols for RF energy harvesting and information transmission for both AF and DF networks.

The performance of the two MRT methods is evaluated in terms of speed-up and accuracy by comparison to an iteratively coupled solution scheme. We observe that the extrapolation-based semi-implicit method gives a higher speed-up but is strongly dependent on the relative time scales of the latent (slow) and active (fast) components. On the other hand, the compound-fast method is more robust and less sensitive to the relative time scales, but gives lower speed up as compared to the semi-implicit method, especially when the relative time scales of the active and latent components are comparable.
