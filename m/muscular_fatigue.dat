40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community only. Multiple {{factors have been}} shown in isolation to affect landing mechanics and increase the risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries including gender, fatigue and drop jump height. However, there is {{a gap in the}} literature on the interaction of these factors. The purpose of the current research was to identify the combined effects of drop height and fatigue on landing mechanics in recreationally active females. Subjects participated in a <b>muscular</b> <b>fatiguing</b> protocol and a series of drop jumps from a range of heights before and after fatiguing exercises. Kinematic results from this study demonstrated that hip flexion decreased at initial contact, and knee flexion and hip flexion increased in the maximum position as drop height increased. As a result of fatigue, knee valgus in the maximum position increased along with vertical ground reaction forces and loading rate. These increased ground reaction forces were observed with drop height as well. Interaction effects were observed in the peak frontal plane ankle moment and frontal plane hip angle at impact suggesting that fatigue and drop height do have a combined effect on landing mechanics. Athletes and coaches can use this information to design optimal training and injury prevention programs by implementing various heights and states of fatigue in their training in order for the athlete to improve their landing mechanics in these high injury risk situations.

During ∼15 km uphill cycling on high mountain passes they cycle about 70 rpm. Cyclists choose cadence to minimise <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and not metabolic demand, since oxygen consumption is lower at cadences 60-70 rpm. When cycling at 260 W, a pedal force was the lowest at 90 rpm, lower than at 60, 75, 105 or 120 rpm. It is primarily due to increase of inertia of the crank with increasing cadence.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the changes in corticomuscular coherence after muscle fatigue during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and 50 % of MVC of the tested muscle (right Adductor Pollicis muscles "APM"). Nine right- handed normal volunteers, four women and five men, whose age was 3512 years (SD) were studied. Maximum coherence values of (0. 041) at 38 Hz. (in gamma band) were seen in non-fatigued MVC; and values of (0. 042) at 32 Hz and 34 Hz. (in gamma band) for fatigued MVC of right APM were demonstrated. During 50 % of MVC of right APM (in non-fatigued contraction), maximum coherence value of (0. 044) at 26 Hz (beta band) is noted. In fatigued 50 %MVC, maximum coherence value is seen at beta frequency band (0. 048 at 14 Hz). These results have demonstrated the functional coupling between the motor cortex and the contracting muscle during <b>fatigued</b> <b>muscular</b> contraction.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{a formal}} {{assessment}} of <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{was not made}} in this study, so the extent of <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> across the course is not known. Although progressive <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> might be expected during a continuous event, that {{does not appear to}} be the case as <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> has been found to stabilize by around 12  h during a 24 -h treadmill run [24]. Indeed, runners may accommodate by slowing as has been previously demonstrated to begin around 70  km in the present event [22, 25] and after approximately 6  h during a 24 -h treadmill run [24, 26]. Variation in course profile, ambient temperature conditions, visibility impairment from darkness, and available energy sources contribute to these changes in speed during the Western States Endurance Run, making it difficult to know the extent of <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> throughout the event. Such factors may contribute to our finding that muscle cramping did not vary statistically across the course segments, although inspection of the data suggests that cramping and near cramping tended to be most common after the first course segment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to assess the overall fatigue of human body movement. First of all, {{according}} to previous research regarding localized <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue,</b> a linear relation is assumed between the mean frequency and the muscular working time when the muscle is experiencing fatigue. This assumption is verified with a rigorous statistical analysis. Based on this proven linearity, localized <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> is simplified as a linear model. Furthermore, localized <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> is considered a dynamic process and, hence, the localized fatigue levels are tracked by updating the parameters with the most current surface electromyogram (sEMG) measurements. Finally, an overall fatigue level is computed by fusing localized <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> levels.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influences of load {{carriage and}} <b>muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> on ground reaction forces and ground reaction loading rates during walking. Eighteen healthy males performed the following tasks in order: unloaded and unfatigued walking, loaded and unfatigued walking, fatiguing exercise, loaded and fatigued walking, and unloaded and fatigued walking. The fatiguing exercise consisted of a series of metered step-ups and heel raises with a 16 -kg rucksack. Loaded walking tasks were performed with a 32 -kg rucksack. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variances were used to determine the effects of fatigue and load carriage on ground reaction forces and loading rates. <b>Muscular</b> <b>fatigue</b> has a significant influence on peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 01).

If lower limb fatigue {{increases}} vertical ground reaction forces during running, the athlete may be predisposed to injury. This information may help personal trainers make recommendations {{on whether it}} is best to run before or after activities that fatigue the lower limbs. PURPOSE: To determine if <b>muscular</b> lower limb <b>fatigue</b> affects vertical ground reaction forces during running. METHODS: Ten healthy, habitually active subjects aged 18 - 46 y volunteered for the study. Each subject was instructed to jog at a medium fast constant speed approximately 6 m over two force plates (AMTI, 1500 Hz). GRFs were recorded during left foot contact, both before and after an exhaustive treadmill run determined by reaching an RPE of 15 on a 20 -point scale and maintaining that pace for at least 30 seconds. Peak vertical impact forces for two to three trials were averaged for each condition and a dependent t-test (SPSS v. 22) was used to analyze the mean difference in pre-and-post fatigue GRFs. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to graph within-subject differences due to the intervention. RESULTS: Mean GRF values for pre 2 ̆ 6 post fatigue were 1518. 95 +/- 406. 23 N and 1503. 39 +/- 401. 34 N, respectively, which were not significantly different (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).

50|$|LDH {{works to}} prevent <b>muscular</b> failure and <b>fatigue</b> in {{multiple}} ways. The lactate-forming reaction generates cytosolic NAD+, which feeds into the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction {{to help maintain}} cytosolic redox potential and promote substrate flux through {{the second phase of}} glycolysis to promote ATP generation. This, in effect, provides more energy to contracting muscles under heavy workloads. The production and removal of lactate from the cell also ejects a proton consumed in the LDH reaction- the removal of excess protons produced in the wake of this fermentation reaction serves to act as a buffer system for muscle acidosis. Once proton accumulation exceeds the rate of uptake in lactate production and removal through the LDH symport, muscular acidosis occurs.|$|R
