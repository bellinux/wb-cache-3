5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> massive impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it solidified. Furthermore, its triaxial dimensions are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E

A party on Mount Hood was able to communicate {{back and forth with}} the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on Rainier, Baker, Jefferson, and Diamond Peak were not successful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> dense smoke and logistical problems.|$|E

5|$|Theobald was {{the patron}} of his {{successor}} Thomas Becket, {{and a number}} of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his see, or bishopric. Historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in the historical record, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the fame of his successor.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
5|$|Between 2004 and 2005, the aqueduct's {{surviving}} arches were {{restored and}} a lighting system was installed, {{at a total}} cost of Lm 140,000. Some of the arches {{are in need of}} restoration once again, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> pollution since a major road now runs alongside the aqueduct. A section of the aqueduct was extensively damaged in December 2013 due to a car crash, but the damage has since been repaired.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, {{similar to those of}} their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts.|$|E
5|$|Partly due to Maurice's pro-treaty activity, Moore Hall was burnt by anti-treaty {{forces in}} 1923, {{during the final}} months of the Irish Civil War. Moore {{eventually}} received compensation of £7,000 from {{the government of the}} Irish Free State. By this time George and Maurice had become estranged, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> an unflattering portrait of the latter which appeared in Hail and Farewell. Tension also arose as a result of religious differences: Maurice frequently made donations to the Roman Catholic Church from estate funds. Moore later sold {{a large part of the}} estate to the Irish Land Commission for £25,000.|$|E

30|$|Reports on arthroscopic ACL {{reconstruction}} in congenital {{deficiencies of}} the lower limb are rare. This might be <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> the patients do not complain of instability in daily activity. Furthermore, intraarticular ACL reconstruction {{in the absence of}} a femoral notch is challenging.|$|R
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been {{nearly impossible to}} strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> greater urbanization and industrialization than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were to be put on sale in August 1922, but in the meantime the Irish Free State army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own barracks before they retreated from Cork, destroying most of the labels.|$|E

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|While {{the mission}} towns in Paraguay flourished, the evangelization of the Guaraní (Chiriguanos) in Bolivia proved difficult. With {{encouragement}} from Agustín Gutiérrez de Arce, {{the governor of}} Santa Cruz, the Jesuits focused their efforts on the Chiquitania, where the Christian doctrine was more readily accepted. Between 1691 and 1760 eleven missions were founded in the area; however, fires, floods, plagues, famines and attacks by hostile tribes or slave traders caused many missions to be re-established or rebuilt. The Chiquitos missions were spared large-scale epidemics, unlike those in Paraguay, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their remote locations {{and the lack of}} transportation infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.|$|E
