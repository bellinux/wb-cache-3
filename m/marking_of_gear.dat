5000|$|GEAR follows four robots {{who work}} in a falling-apart toy factory in the distant future. An {{electrical}} accident brings one of the dolls they manufacture to life, and Doll and Robots learn together the value of play and humanity. Each robot discovers a special skill they have, and so the show gradually incorporates mime, juggling, breakdance, and magic. Another distinguishing <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>GEAR</b> is the extensive use of stage technology. Projection mapping is used extensively, as are lasers, an LED dress, and moving lighting. In the words of Japan Times reviewer Andrew Eglinton: [...] In contrast, the production was lent a particularly powerful dimension through projection-mapping technology that allowed the crew to project light and video designs onto isolated parts of the Modernist factory to create {{the impression of a}} futuristic, automated world. [...] In “Gear,” though, projection-mapping animates the space and enables fast-paced scene changes, and is also used to turn audience members into mapping surfaces to conjure a remarkable holistic experience.|$|R

An {{accurate}} {{finite element}} contact analysis <b>of</b> helical <b>gears</b> was done directly under ANSYS, while the integrated elastic deformation of the meshed teeth was extracted {{directly from the}} finite element contact analysis results, and considered as the main basis {{of the amount of}} tooth profile modification. Linear, conic, cubic, and sine relief curve are compiled and established in MATLAB, on which <b>gear</b> models <b>of</b> two ways <b>of</b> modified <b>gear</b> are built. Under the same modified parameters, contact method is used on the proposed finite element models <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> by software LS-DYNA, and the effect of the two ways <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> relief on contact force on teeth face is analyzed. The results show that the effect of a pair <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> relief is better than one gear relief for linear and conic relief curve, and the effect <b>of</b> one <b>gear</b> relief is better than a pair <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> relief for cubic and sine relief curve.

Field measured time series of SCADA signals, including wind speed, generator power and rotational speed, were used to obtain the statistical variation <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shaft torque and rotational speed.
