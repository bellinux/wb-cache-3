5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent <b>more</b> <b>employees</b> to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the midst}} of Eastern's turmoil American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall sought a new hub in order to utilize new {{aircraft}} which AA had on order. AA studies indicated that Delta Air Lines would provide strong competition on most routes from Eastern's hub at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, but that MIA had many key routes only served by Eastern. American {{announced that it would}} establish a base at MIA in August 1988. Lorenzo considered selling Eastern's profitable Latin American routes to AA as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization of Eastern in early 1989, but backed out in a last-ditch effort to rebuild the MIA hub. The effort quickly proved futile, and American purchased the routes (including the route authority between Miami and London then held by Eastern sister company Continental Airlines) in a liquidation of Eastern which was completed in 1990. Later in the 1990s, American transferred <b>more</b> <b>employees</b> and equipment to MIA from its failed domestic hubs at Nashville, Tennessee and Raleigh–Durham, North Carolina. Today Miami is American's largest air freight hub and is the main connecting point in the airline's north–south international route network.|$|E
25|$|During his presidency, Obama, Congress, and the Supreme Court all {{contributed to}} a huge {{expansion}} of LGBT rights. In 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded hate crime laws to cover crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation. In December 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which ended the military's policy of disallowing openly {{gay and lesbian people}} from openly serving in the United States Armed Forces. Obama also supported the passage of ENDA, which would ban discrimination against employees on the basis of gender or sexual identity for all companies with 15 or <b>more</b> <b>employees,</b> and the similar but more comprehensive Equality Act. Neither bill passed Congress. In May 2012, Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage, shortly after Vice President Joe Biden had also expressed support for the institution. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, and Obama personally congratulated the plaintiff. Obama also issued dozens of executive orders intended to help LGBT Americans, including a 2010 order that extended full benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. A 2014 order prohibited discrimination against employees of federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter ended the ban on women in combat roles, and in 2016, he ended the ban on transgender individuals openly serving in the military. On the international stage, Obama advocated for gay rights, particularly in Africa.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to the theoretical contribution discussed above, the study also increases our understanding of certain managerial practices concerning how transformational leaders motivate employees to speak up with their suggestions. First, our results indicate that leaders who use transformational strategies can evoke employees by generating positive affect to stimulate <b>more</b> <b>employee</b> voice behavior. Therefore, transformational leaders should focus on utilizing the strategy of inspirational motivation to influence employee affect. Furthermore, leaders should give <b>employees</b> <b>more</b> individualized consideration and prioritize {{the creation of a}} favorable affective workplace environment. Supervisors should also directly invite employees to speak up through participatory supervisory practices. Employees who perceive themselves as valued and respected by their supervisors are more likely to generate positive affect and in turn engage in more voice.|$|R
