50|$|In this {{reaction}} the alkyne <b>methyl</b> <b>2-octynoate</b> reacts with triphenylphosphine to an intermediate zwitterionic allenolate, a dipolarophile for the 1,3-dipole 2-phenylnitrone. The primary regioselective 3+2dipolar cycloaddition product then rearranges to a -dihydroisoxazole with regeneration of the phosphine. This reaction only {{takes place in}} water with lithium chloride added even though the reactants do not dissolve in this medium. In organic solvents such as toluene or dichloromethane no reaction takes place.|$|E
