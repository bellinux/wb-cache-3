30|$|Access to robust 24 -h IR {{coverage}} {{should be}} a priority for all acute care hospitals. For this duty, the number of interventional radiologists must be sufficient. However, with many hospitals having limited or, in some instances, no direct access to IR services, the provision of IR services remains variable. Our data demonstrate that the situation in Europe is somewhat better than that shown {{in a recent survey}} performed in the UK, where less than one third of hospitals are able to provide comprehensive out-of-hours IR care, potentially putting many patients at risk [3]. In Europe, about 60 % of radiological departments can cover IR emergencies. This is not enough, however, and is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed. Services consisting of six or more interventional radiologists will usually be able to provide an effective and sustainable service. If this is not the case, the first solution should be networking among hospitals. This can be difficult to organize, especially if there is competition among different hospitals or <b>radiological</b> <b>units,</b> but would allow providing emergency services on a 24 -h basis within a region and even to provide separate vascular and non-vascular rota in order to give highly specialized services.|$|R

These devices are based on semiconductor (Si and GaAs) pixel detectors of different thickness, read-out by custom designed integrated circuits. To assess the imaging capability of such systems, the images of a mammographic phantom have been acquired in standard conditions for a clinical examination. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of details simulating tumor masses has been evaluated. The same phantom has been also radiographed by three different commercial digital mammographic systems in the same reference conditions and a comparison in terms of SNR has been carried out. The spatial resolution of the single photon counting systems has also been evaluated by measuring the line spread function with the edge technique and then calculating the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF).

40|$|Introduction The Gamma Knife {{system is}} {{designed}} solely for non-invasive treatment of brain disorders, and it benefits from stereotactic surgical techniques. Dose calculations required in the system are performed by GammaPlan code; in this code, brain tissue is considered uniform. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Gamma Knife system on the obtained dose through simulating a real human brain phantom. Materials and Methods In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation code (MCNPX 2. 7) was employed to simulate Gamma Knife system. Brain tissue equivalent Snyder phantom and combinations were considered according to International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> <b>Units</b> (ICRU) - 44 report. Results To ensure accuracy of the simulations, patient’s head was modeled by a spherical water phantom. At this point, the dosimetry parameters were compared with those obtained by the Monte Carlo code EGS 4 and good consistency was observed (less than 7 % difference). At the next stage, the above dosimetry parameters were compared with those obtained experimentally by polystyrene phantom and EDR 2 dosimetry film and improved consistency was detected (less than 0. 5 % difference). Finally, the Snyder phantom, as the human brain, was simulated. The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) and penumbra decreased by 4. 7 % and 18 %, respectively. Moreover, an isocenter dose reduction of 30 - 40 %, compared to the water phantom, was noted. Conclusion The calculation of the real phantom showed that water and polystyrene could function similarly, while evaluating dosimetry parameters in the Gamma Knife system; thus, water and polystyrene are not appropriate phantom matters for this purpose...|$|R

Seven radiological procedures such as; chest PA, abdomen AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, skull AP, knee AP, and hand AP frequently carried out in Nigeria were included in the study, and their local diagnostic {{reference levels}} (LDRLs) were determined. The values of the determined LDRLs were compared with established NDRLs in UK, US, Slovenia, Italy and Brazil. The LDRLs determined in the two groups (healthcare centres) studied ranged from 1. 78 to 3. 01, 2. 71 to 2. 84, 2. 11 to 3. 79, 3. 93 to 8. 79, 1. 06 to 1. 73 and 1. 10 to 1. 44  mGy for chest PA, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, skull AP, knee AP and hand AP respectively.
