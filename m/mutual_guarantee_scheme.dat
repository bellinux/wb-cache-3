40|$|It {{is known}} that micro and small {{enterprises}} (often unbankable) have usually difficulties in the access to the financial system; {{in order to facilitate}} their credit access in many countries different kind of <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> and institutions generally grant different typologies of <b>guarantees.</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> and institutions can significantly contribute to facilitate the credit access of micro and small enterprises, by reducing the information asymmetries between the lender and the borrower and, in some cases, by decreasing the cost of funding. In this perspective, this research aims at offering a comprehensive comparative analysis of the most significant models of micro credit sector and guarantee funds adopted in two European country (Italy and Spain) and in two African countries (Morocco and Tunisia). The perspective adopted in the paper is finally addressed to highlight the strength and weaknesses of the different typology of microcredit guarantee system, in order to: point out some regulatory or operative solutions which, once known, may improve the economic sustainability of the microcredit sector/institutions and, ultimately, can contribute to really facilitate the access to credit for microenterprises...|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> and institutions help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) {{to improve their}} access to credit, by reducing existing information asymmetries and improving credit conditions for those who benefit from such guarantees. In European economies, mostly characterised by small firms, <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> institutions play a very significant role in sustaining national economies. This book analyzes the functioning of guarantee systems for SMEs in countries where these schemes play an important part. Furthermore, it investigates the expected evolutions of the guarantees offered by the <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> institutions {{in the framework of}} Basel II, since only under certain conditions are the guarantees eligible under the New Basel Capital Accord.

40|$|The author {{provides}} a descriptive analysis {{of credit and}} monetary policies in Malaysia and investigates the distributional consequences of monetary policy there by focusing on small and medium-size industries and large manufacturing firms. The author suggests that"payoff"or"default"risk - as captured by the spread between safe and risky debt - is still well above its pre-crisis level, underscoring the increased agency costs of external finance. The decline in lending activity {{in the first half}} of 1998 can be attributed to the reduced supply of bank credit relative to demand. Empirical results from vector autoregression on analysis demonstrates that monetary tightening disproportionately affects small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, monetary shocks contribute substantially more to small and medium-size firms'variance of production (71 percent) than to that of large manufacturing firms (30 percent). These findings corroborate the notion that small and medium-size industries face greater market imperfection, which in turn magnify the effects of a given policy shift. Policymakers should weigh the distributional consequences of policy actions and should consider measures to alleviate the disproportionate impact that market imperfections have on small and medium-size industries. Measures to alleviate information asymmetry in credit markets - including the promotion of cooperative or <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> for small and medium-size enterprises [...] are one useful option. Groups of firms in Southern Europe have made wide use of <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> - usually within a specific industry - to provide a privately organized"insurance system"for lending banks that allows the banks to rely less on the assets of individual companies within the group in making loan decisions. The pooling effects of such a system would reduce the risk to the bank of default and would give members of the society an incentive to reveal information to the society that they might hesitate to give to the bank.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms experience difficulties in accessing the credit market due to informational asymmetries. Banks can overcome these asymmetries through relationship lending, or at least mitigate their effects by asking for collateral. Small firms, {{especially if they are}} young, have little collateral and short credit histories, and thus may find it difficult to raise funds from banks. In this paper, we show that even in this case, small firms may improve their borrowing capacity by joining <b>Mutual</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Institutions (MGI). Our empirical analysis shows that small firms affiliated to MGIs pay less for credit compared with similar firms. We obtain this result for interest rates charged on loan contracts which are not backed by <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantees.</b> We then argue that our findings are consistent with the view that MGIs are better at screening and monitoring opaque borrowers than banks are. Thus, banks benefit from the willingness of MGIs to post collateral since this implies that firms are better screened and monitored.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the deposit}} guarantee value affects the risk incentives in a <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> system. We liken the guarantee's value {{to that of}} a European-style contingent claims portfolio. The main feature emerging from our model is that a <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> system would give banks an adverse incentive to increase riskiness. To mitigate this incentive, we introduce a regulatory provision modelled using a path-dependent contingent claim. By comparing the <b>mutual</b> <b>guarantee</b> system with a non-mutual one, we show that the former is less expensive, but implies higher adverse incentives for the banks, especially for undercapitalized institutions.

40|$|We {{examine the}} role played by <b>Mutual</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Institutions (MGIs) in the lending {{policies}} undertaken by banks {{at the peak of the}} Great Crisis of 2007 - 2009. We address this issue by using a large database on Italian firms built from the credit files of UniCredit banking Group and focusing on small business. We provide an empirical analysis of the determinants of the probability that a borrowing firm will suffer financial tension and obtain two main innovative findings. First, we show that small firms supported by MGIs were less likely to experience financial tensions even at that time of utmost financial stress. Second, our empirical evidence shows that MGIs have played a signalling role beyond the simple provision of a collateral. This latter finding suggests that the information provided by MGIs turned out to be key for bank-firm relations as scoring and rating systems - being typically based on pro-cyclical indicators - had become less informative during the crisis. financial crisis, bank-firm relationships, asymmetric information, credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes,</b> small business finance, peer monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) face many constraints, such {{as lack of}} credit, which hinder them from reaching their job-creating potential. This article focuses on the constraints that increase banks' risk in lending to SMEs, and how credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> are used to overcome some of them. In South Africa, Khula Enterprise Finance Limited, a government initiative, operates three such <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes.</b> This article explains the functioning {{of one of the}} schemes, namely Khula's Individual Credit <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Scheme.</b> Its performance is evaluated with reference to international best practices. Although it is generally found to operate efficiently, there are various aspects concerning the functioning of the scheme that influence negatively the willingness of banks to participate. These problems need to be addressed, as the authors are convinced that a credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme,</b> with all its problems, still remains a viable way for the government to lower the normally high risk involved for banks in dealing with SMEs, and in this way to entice them to serve SMEs. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} in the MENA region have established partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> to facilitate SME access to finance. These schemes {{can play an important}} role, especially in a period where MENA governments are making efforts to improve the effectiveness of credit registries and bureaus and strengthen creditor rights. This paper reviews the design of partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA, and assesses their preliminary outcomes. The paper is based on a survey conducted in 10 MENA {{countries in}} early 2010. The authors find that the average size of <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA (measured by the total value of outstanding guarantees) is in line with the international average, although there are wide differences across countries, and some schemes seem too small to make any significant impact. Most importantly, the number of guarantees looks generally small while their average value looks large. This suggests that <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> are not yet reaching the smaller firms. <b>Guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA look financially sound and most schemes have room to grow. However, this growth should be accompanied by an improvement of some key design and management features, as well as the introduction of systematic impact evaluation reviews.

40|$|Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are {{considered}} as {{backbone of the}} national economies, whether developing, or developed nations, due to their contribution to economic growth and capital accumulation. In Malaysia, therefore, the government has formulated various strategies to encourage development of the SMEs with the objectives of economic growth, capital accumulation and creating employment opportunities. One of such strategies resulted {{in the formation of}} Credit Guarantee Corporation, as a guarantor for the SMEs. The booming phenomenon of Islamic finance especially in Malaysia has influenced the CGC to come up with Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme,</b> parallel with the demand of Islamic financing products in the country. However, since the scheme was introduced by the Corporation, in general, the performance of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> has not performed as expected and has not been as competitive as the conventional <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme,</b> even though the scheme has recorded positive growth for its products since the inception. This study, therefore, aims to explore the various demand conditions for the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> with the objective of finding possible solutions for the gaps exist in the scheme. A survey schedule was conducted through e-mail questionnaires directed to the SME entrepreneurs. The data was analyzed by using SPSS version 15. The findings indicate that there are some gaps in the scheme's operations pertaining to promotional aspects, product development, staff competency, and government involvement. Hence, the effectiveness of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> can be questioned, although, undeniably there are some who have benefited from the services. It should also be stated {{that the majority of the}} entrepreneurs, due to such reasons, are excluded benefiting the positive side of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> due to the glitches in the system.
