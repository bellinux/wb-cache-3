One important activity in most manufacturing systems is to transport products or resources between different positions. In a flexible manufacturing system it can be challenging to design and plan these <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> due to their complex logical behavior. This paper presents a method that identifies, creates and visualizes these <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> based on inputs from a standard virtual manufacturing tool and a high level product operation recipe.

40|$|In {{terms of}} efficiency, road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> have {{historically}} seen very little development {{relative to other}} supply chain areas and some authors have even referred to freight transportation as the “forgotten factor. ” Several studies world-wide have shown a generally low level of efficiency in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations.</b> The U. S. Department of Transportation published a report in 2008 on the costs of inefficiencies in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations,</b> stating that inefficiencies related to, e. g., loading and unloading cost the nation’s road transport operators over 3 billion USD annually. The literature discusses the various efficiency issues in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations,</b> in areas such as, i. e., route planning, organization, routines at loading and unloading and efficiency issues related to security initiatives and wasteful operations. Waste corresponds to everything (resources, time, activities, etc.) that does not add value, e. g., waiting, defects and unnecessary administration. Due to the large environmental and societal impact of <b>transport</b> <b>operations,</b> interest and legislation from authorities and societies is mounting on supply chain members involved in freight transportation to increase operational efficiency. Previous literature has proposed that information deficiency is a reason for inefficiency and has pointed to information sharing (an overarching term involving the adaptation of processes, information and enabling technology) to improve efficiency, yet it is unclear both how to address waste in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> and how information sharing can improve efficiency and the potential of it. This thesis addresses those questions with the focus “to explore and define waste in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> and estimate the efficiency potential of information sharing. ” The findings of this thesis are relevant for industry, academia and policy-makers. This thesis brings the attention of managers to the various other types of waste prevalent in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> and provides frameworks that are useful in addressing waste in a structured fashion. The drivers’ working time is the biggest individual cost for road transport operators and even minor reductions of waste of drivers’ working time can enable significant cost savings. The academic contribution is definitions on waste, a conceptual framework of information sharing, insights on supply chain transport relationships and quantification of the potential of information sharing. Several authorities are now investing in research and creating roadmaps on how investments in Information Communication Technologies (ICT) can improve efficiency of road <b>transport</b> <b>operations.</b> This thesis contributes to policy with important knowledge on where roadmaps, policies and applications of ICT should be aimed...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{publications}} on freight <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> have {{outlined the}} need for increased effectiveness and better use of information in <b>transport</b> <b>operations.</b> A key to this is the availability and accessibility of information to improve management of the various activities. Improved electronic information sharing reduces the time needed for manually typing data into different systems when handling freight. The technical development that has been taking place over the recent years has created opportunities that can support exchange of information in the freight industry beyond what previously has been possible. Some of these developed technologies and methods enable increased efficiency and secure information quality. A holistic approach to combine physical assets with Information- and communication technology (ICT) solutions and systems in order to enable better logistics solutions {{is the foundation of}} the Smart Transportation Management (STM) concept. By combining the physical infrastructure (warehouse, terminals, etc.) with a digital infrastructure (ICT solutions), an Intelligent Infrastructure (II) is facilitated. The II could be defined as a support infrastructure, as the purpose is to support freight <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> in various ways. This paper starts out by outlining a number of issues and challenges in freight <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> that were combined and aggregated to create a point of departure for the work. The main purpose of the paper is to explore ICT-enhanced support infrastructures for freight <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> in the context of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The results show that the framework of STM will provide a mapping capability of the subject and an analysis model intended to identify and highlight where and how implementations of STM create valuable impacts on <b>transport</b> <b>operations.</b> These contributions are aimed at the transportation research area in logistics, with a focus on those that are researching information related issues and ITS. Physical and digital infrastructure provides support for <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> through combining the individual functionality and provides the transport industry with new opportunities for improved operations. With such a ICS based freight ITS framework that support <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> it is possible to improve operational excellence within the transportation industry, mainly the road based one...|$|R

40|$|Road {{transportation}} {{has become}} {{an important factor in}} international trade and the management of supply chains. However, this form of product logistics has generally been considered inefficient. Traditionally, practical inefficiencies of road transportation have been addressed through mathematical modelling, operations research-based methods and simulation. This paper presents an alternative systematic approach to improve road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> based on lean thinking and the reduction of the seven transportation extended wastes. To do this, the paper reviews the extant literature in the area of lean road transportation, providing a structured research definition of the application of lean thinking in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations</b> and hence guidance on the limited research conducted in this field. The systematic lean transportation method is then presented and empirically tested through a case study in a Mexican firm. The results obtained from the case study indicate that the proposed systematic lean method is an effective alternative for the improvement of road <b>transport</b> <b>operations,</b> with the number of distribution routes and distance travelled being reduced by 27 and 32 %, respectively. The proposed method can be used by organisations as a guide to help them improve their road <b>transport</b> <b>operations.</b> In addition, the paper’s aim is to contribute by stimulating scholars to further study the application of lean thinking and waste reduction in road <b>transport</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
