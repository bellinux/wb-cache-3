25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> last real {{training of the}} real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|The Wire {{published}} a favorable review by Joseph Stannard, {{in which he}} wrote [...] "If it is an elaborate put-on—and I suspect Ferraro isn't averse to a chuckle {{at the expense of}} his audience—Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases' worth of research and development. ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze, Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime." [...] Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies, citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent. Wharton said, [...] "Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages." [...] In Pitchforks review, Soderberg wrote, [...] "the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> point. ... You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always." ...|$|E

Finding out she's pregnant is a nightmare". Mercedes informed Tony about the pregnancy, despite their dislike for each other, {{because she felt}} {{he had the right}} to know. According to Metcalfe, Mercedes considered giving her baby to her sister, since Jacqui was unable to have children but wanted to become a mother, but did not tell Jacqui the baby's paternity. Metcalfe also felt that Mercedes decided against giving Jacqui the baby because Mercedes was unable to [...] "cope" [...] with the baby's paternity, and would be more willing to give Jacqui the baby if Tony was not the father. When asked if Mercedes would keep the baby herself, Metcalfe said, [...] "She would if it was Russ' or <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> product of a one-night stand. But Tony's baby and all the baggage that comes with that? No thanks!" [...] Mercedes decided to terminate the pregnancy. When asked how she thought Jacqui would react if she found out that Tony was the father, Metcalfe said Jacqui would [...] "go a bit psycho". She also said that it would take a long time for Jacqui to forgive Mercedes if she discovered the truth.|$|E

The feature of having two riders per kart was praised by Justin Leeper and Andy McNamara of Game Informer; McNamara stated: [...] "Giving the player control of two different characters is pretty cool in single-player, but add a friend {{on the back of}} your kart in multiplayer and it opens the game up like never before."

[...] He then praised many aspects of the episode, including the cast, stating, [...] "Since episode one, the show has been built on these strong female characters.

[...] Geoff Berkshire of Zap2it called the episode [...] "overly talky...and not quite as compelling {{as the rest of the}} season so far." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.
