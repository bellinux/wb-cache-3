At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority.

Methods: 70 type 2 diabetic patients and 70 non-diabetic subjects matched for BMI, age and gender were studied. Liver fat (1 H-MRS), body composition (MRI), and biochemical markers of insulin resistance were measured. Results. The type 2 diabetic patients had on the average 80 % <b>more</b> liver <b>fat</b> and 16 % <b>more</b> intra-abdominal <b>fat</b> than the non-diabetic subjects.

25|$|There is a {{caste system}} within the B. petiolata colonies. There are {{physiological}} and morphological differences between worker castes and reproductive castes. Foundresses and gynes (reproductive caste) are generally larger than workers. When workers are first born their body size {{is much smaller}} than gynes and foundresses, but later in the colony cycle, their size grows more similar to gynes. Foundresses and gynes have larger ovaries and <b>more</b> <b>fat</b> content than workers do. Workers have broad heads, while the reproductive caste wasps have broader thoraces and gasters. Typically, foundresses are larger than their subordinates. Also, about 98% of queens (foundresses) and 95% of gynes {{are found to be}} inseminated, while workers are not. They have immature ovaries that do not function in the presence of an active queen. When there is no active queen, about 11% of workers develop mature ovaries. Active queens are the primary egg layers in colonies and possess well-developed ovaries.|$|E

500|$|Though sheep's milk may {{be drunk}} rarely in fresh form, {{today it is}} used {{predominantly}} in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far <b>more</b> <b>fat,</b> solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. [...] Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.|$|E
50|$|A {{risk factor}} for {{diabetes}} within the indigenous population is dietary change over time.

2500|$|Bergmann's rule {{establishes}} {{that among}} endothermic animals {{of the same}} species, body size increases with latitude. [...] Studies have tested whether this rule also applies to social insects. [...] L. acervorum workers were counted {{in a sample of}} colonies from Erlangen and Karelia. [...] The worker size was significantly larger in the Karelian population, with the average thorax length being 1.15mm ± 0.07mm. [...] The average thorax length from the Erlangen population was 1.08 ± 0.05mm. [...] As evidenced, the workers from Karelia were on average 10% larger than the workers from Erlangen. The results suggest that larger body sizes in L. acervorum from boreal habitats might result from selection for increased fasting endurance. [...] Larger workers had <b>more</b> <b>fat</b> than small workers, and would survive longer in colder environments.

2500|$|By {{wearing a}} tightly-laced corset for {{extended}} periods, known as tightlacing, {{men and women}} can learn to tolerate extreme waist constriction and eventually reduce their natural waist size.

Feeding no sup-plemental fat in the diet for the first seven days resulted in a decrease in the percentage of ab-dominal fat at 49 days of age. High dietary protein levels were detrimental to growth during the starting period (0 to 14 days) but beneficial in maximizing gain and feed efficiency during the finishing period (28 to 49 days). Feeding no supplemental fat for the first 7 days of age, regardless of the energy level of the finisher, produced the least abdominal fat of all diets fed to 49 days. <b>More</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> was produced when supplemental fat was withheld for 0 to 10 days or 0 to 14 days of age...|$|R
