2500|$|In {{the early}} and mid-1990s, the alarm systems, elevators, windows, and air {{conditioning}} were replaced; the 86th floor observation deck was made accessible to disabled visitors; and the facade was again refurbished {{at a cost of}} $55 million. Prudential sold the land under the building in 1991 for $42 million to a buyer representing hotelier Hideki Yokoi, who was at the time imprisoned in connection with a deadly fire at the Hotel New Japan hotel in Tokyo. The land was bought jointly by Donald Trump and Hideki Yokoi in 1994. Having secured a half-ownership of the land, Trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it, even though Helmsley and Malkin had already started their refurbishment project. He sued Empire State Building Associates in February 1995, claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a [...] "high-rise slum" [...] and a [...] "second-rate, rodent-infested" [...] office tower. Trump had aimed to get Empire State Building Associates evicted by breaking their lease, but that action was denied, and Helmsley's companies sued Trump in May of that year. This sparked a round of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years, which partially arose from Trump's desire to obtain the building's <b>master</b> <b>lease</b> by taking it from Empire State Building Associates. Upon Harry Helmsley's death in 1997, the Malkins sued Helmsley's widow Leona Helmsley for ownership of the building.|$|E
