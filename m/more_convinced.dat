5|$|Moving {{into the}} 1960s, Marcus became ever <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> that his city {{and his company}} needed {{to take action to}} promote racial equality, both as a moral issue and to reduce the growing civil unrest. In 1968, he {{announced}} that Neiman-Marcus's buyers would give preference to companies employing and training significant numbers of minority employees, making his firm one of the first companies in the nation to have such a policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, do not recognize this putative synonymy.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September Mack {{decided to}} hold the Iller line {{anchored}} on Ulm. In {{the last three days}} of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauwörth. The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place– they instead deployed on a long west-east axis– and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack's escape route.|$|E

25|$|He {{strongly}} criticised {{the cruel}} treatment and punishment meted {{out to the}} slaves, and became <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> {{of the need to}} improve their conditions. This led him into involvement in local government, but he was the target of much antagonism and personal attack from the planters, who resented his interference, because of his measures to ameliorate the conditions of the slaves. His letters to the bishop of London illustrate the attitudes of the American colonists in the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{claimed that}} he was <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> of his method of doing {{philosophy}} than of his philosophical conclusions. Science {{was one of the}} principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.|$|E

25|$|The program's fourth season, in 2003, {{was set on}} the Pacific {{island nation}} of New Caledonia and {{entitled}} The Mole: in Paradise. In an attempt to steer any suspicion from her being the Mole, Petrina was eliminated in one episode but returned on the next episode after accepting an offer from the host to buy her {{way back into the}} game. While this worked for a short time, it was not as successful as had been hoped, with some of the other contestants even <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> that she was the Mole. This series was replayed during the day in April 2007.|$|E
25|$|Sensing these feelings, Charles III of Spain {{progressively}} {{eased the}} trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port {{in the late}} 18th century. The capture of Porto Bello by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, {{to the detriment of}} Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Perú and create instead the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the porteños, some of them versed in the ideology of the French Revolution, became even <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> of the need for independence from Spain.|$|E
25|$|The Scopes Trial of 1925 {{is perhaps}} the most famous court case of its kind. The Butler Act had {{prohibited}} the teaching of evolution in public schools in Tennessee. Clarence Darrow was the defense counsel, and William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor. Bryan appealed for assistance to George McCready Price, Johns Hopkins University physician Howard A. Kelly, physicist Louis T. More, and Alfred W. McCann, all of who had written books supporting creationism. Price was away in England, Kelly and More told Bryan they considered themselves <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> by evolution, and McCann was not interested because of Bryan's stance on prohibition. Nevertheless, a schoolteacher named John T. Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined, although the case was later dismissed on a technicality.|$|E

25|$|General Victor-Constant Michel, Vice-President of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre in 1910, was <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> than Lacrois of a German {{move through}} Belgium, {{because of the}} {{obstacle}} of French defences in Lorraine, the terrain in eastern Belgium and German railway building. Michel thought that the Germans would make their main effort in central Belgium and that covering a longer front would need the organisation of French reserve units and integration with the active army. The council rejected his view in 1911, which caused Michel to resign as he considered that deployment from Belfort to Mézières and an offensive towards Antwerp, Brussels and Namur as the only possible way to respond. Joseph Joffre was eventually appointed and the functions of Vice-President of the Council and Chief of Staff of the army were combined. In October 1911, a strategic assessment was delivered {{as part of a}} comprehensive review conducted from 1911–1912.|$|E
25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E

500|$|At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, Barkley again {{supported}} William G. McAdoo for president. Urban {{interests at}} the convention promoted New York Governor Al Smith, and a bitter convention fight ensued. During the course of 103 ballots, chairman Thomas J. Walsh needed a rest and temporarily yielded his position to Barkley. The convention {{was the first to}} be broadcast nationally, and Barkley's service as chair augmented his national recognition and appeal. The two Democratic factions agreed to compromise, nominating John W. Davis, who Libbey called a [...] "competent nonentity"; Davis lost in the general election to Calvin Coolidge. Barkley won another term in the House by a 2-to-1 margin over his Republican opponent in 1924, but Democratic divisions cost Stanley his Senate seat, and Barkley became even <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> of the value of party loyalty.|$|E

Beth attempts suicide by using a shard of broken mirror to cut her wrist, but Maggie and Lori manage to pry the bathroom door open in time to save Beth, who is bleeding profusely but relatively okay. Andrea returns to the house to check on Beth and is confronted by a furious Maggie. Andrea reasons that she allowed Beth to explore her choices, and Beth is now <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> than ever that suicide is not an option. Maggie condemns Andrea's actions and forbids her from ever again setting foot inside the house.|$|E

500|$|In 1929 Reich and {{his wife}} visited the Soviet Union on a lecture tour, leaving the two {{children}} {{in the care of}} the psychoanalyst Berta Bornstein. Sharaf writes that he returned even <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> of the link between sexual and economic oppression, and of the need to integrate Marx and Freud. In 1929 his article [...] "Dialectical Materialism and Psychoanalysis" [...] was published in Unter dem Banner des Marxismus, the German Communist Party journal. The article explored whether psychoanalysis was compatible with historical materialism, class struggle and proletarian revolution. Reich concluded that they were compatible if dialectical materialism was applied to psychology. This was one of the central theoretical statements of his Marxist period, which included The Imposition of Sexual Morality (1932), The Sexual Struggle of Youth (1932), The Mass Psychology of Fascism (1933), “What is Class Consciousness?” (1934) and The Sexual Revolution (1936).|$|E

King had [...] "for a long time... wanted to take a trip to India." [...] With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959. The trip to India affected King, deepening his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, [...] "Since being in India, I am <b>more</b> <b>convinced</b> than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 April, {{after days}} of {{difficult}} travel, Nansen privately {{began to wonder if}} the pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land.

[...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
