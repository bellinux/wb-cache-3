Fragments of different size and corresponding <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> were established at three study sites in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands in the northern Swiss Jura mountains. Leaf damage was recorded three times over the growing season (late spring, summer and early autumn). Five years after the initiation of the fragmentation, the density of rosettes did not differ between fragments and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> The number of leaves per rosette was higher in fragments than in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> in summer but not in late spring and early autumn. The extent of leaf damage, expressed as proportion of leaf area removed by invertebrate herbivores, increased over the vegetation period. Leaf damage was greater in fragments than in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> at two study sites, whereas the opposite (less strongly expressed) was found at the third site. Number of species and density (individuals per m(2)) of potential herbivores (gastropods and grasshoppers) were recorded in all. fragments and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Effects of fragmentation on the number of species and densities depended on plot size and differed between gastropods and grasshoppers. Leaf damage in fragments increased with increasing density of gastropods if the third site, which had lowest leaf damage, was excluded. Such a positive relationship was neither found in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> nor for grasshopper densities. Thus, movement of gastropods in fragments was probably restricted which resulted in increased feeding pressure at least in two sites. However, even if our fragmentation experiment was well designed and replicated, the interpretation of these experimental results remains difficutt because there was large site-to-site and seasonal variation.

In order to study the vulnerability of cacao (Theobroma cacao) – Gliricidia sepium agroforestry plantations to droughts a large scale throughfall displacement roof was built in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this 19 -month experiment, we compared soil surface CO 2 efflux (soil respiration) from three roof plots with three adjacent <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Soil respiration rates peaked at intermediate soil moisture conditions and decreased under increasingly dry conditions (drought induced), or increasingly wet conditions (as evidenced in <b>control</b> <b>plots).</b> The roof plots exhibited a slight decrease in soil respiration compared to the <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> (average 13 % decrease). The strength of the drought effect was spatially variable – while some measurement chamber sites reacted strongly (responsive) to the decrease in soil water content (up to R 2 = 0. 70) (n = 11), others did not react at all (non-responsive) (n = 7). A significant correlation was measured between responsive soil respiration chamber sites and sap flux density ratios of cacao (R = 0. 61) and Gliricidia (R = 0. 65). Leaf litter CO 2 respiration decreased as conditions became drier. The litter layer contributed approximately 3 – 4 % of the total CO 2 efflux during dry periods and up to 40 % during wet periods. Within days of roof opening soil CO 2 efflux rose to <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> levels. Thereafter, CO 2 efflux remained comparable between roof and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> The cumulative effect on soil CO 2 emissions over the duration of the experiment was not significantly different: the <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> respired 11. 1 ± 0. 5 Mg C ha − 1 yr − 1, while roof plots respired 10. 5 ± 0. 5 Mg C ha − 1 yr − 1.

Four small greenhouses (OTC: open-top-chamber) were set up in May 1995 to cover two alpine species: Arctous alpinus var. japonica and Diapensia lapponica. The temperatures at plant height and the ground were measured in each OTC {{as well as a}} <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> without OTC. The average temperature in OTCs was higher than that in the <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> by 0. 9 OC. In accordance with the temperature enhancement, the plants in OTCs underwent some phenological changes during the summer of 1995. The duration from the leaf emergence to the beginning of coloring in OTCs was longer than that in the <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> by 33 days. Leaf wilting was also delayed in OTCs. Thus, alpine plants responded sensitively to the environmental change in the OTC. 1...|$|R
