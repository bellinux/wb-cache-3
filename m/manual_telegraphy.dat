50|$|Radio amateur {{message relay}} {{operations}} were originally conducted using Morse code {{in the first}} two decades of the 20th century using spark-gap transmitters. As vacuum tubes became affordable operations shifted to more efficient <b>manual</b> <b>telegraphy</b> transmitters, referred to as CW (Continuous wave). Messages were relayed station to station typically covering four or more re-transmission cycles to cover the continental United States, in an organized system of amateur radio networks. After World War II, voice and radioteletype implementations of the message relay system were employed.|$|E
50|$|Telegraphy pre-dated {{telephony}} and magnetos {{were used}} to drive {{some of the early}} printing telegraph instruments. <b>Manual</b> <b>telegraphy</b> with keys and reception by either a needle instrument or a syphon recorder could be powered by batteries. The later automatic and printing instruments, such as the Wheatstone ABC telegraph, required greater currents that could be delivered by a hand-cranked magneto. A hand-crank was used to rotate a belt drive that increases the rotational speed of an armature with a pair of coils between the poles of a stationary horseshoe magnet.|$|E

He also wrote numerous technical articles and books on wireless telegraphy and telephony {{in the first}} decade of the 20th century. [...] His 1913 <b>Manual</b> of Wireless <b>Telegraphy</b> and Telephony provided a detailed and illustrated explanation of his electric arc wireless telephone transmitter and receiver, along with a general coverage of the state of the art.|$|R
