5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
25|$|What {{at first}} held his {{attention}} now <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> flee. It was maddening to be inside– to be swallowed whole– so long. He had {{an image of}} himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.|$|E

2500|$|Bellum {{later said}} in an {{interview}} for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, [...] "Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Venice, Los Angeles, and his birth name is unknown. He adopted the stage name of John Spacely at a young age. His father {{abandoned}} his family, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use his father's last name. He later was known in New York City as Gringo. His grandfather was of Hispanic descent, and he had one brother and one sister. He attended [...] Venice High School.|$|R
25|$|During {{a holiday}} in Killarney, {{he listened to}} the Irish {{broadcaster}} Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8million to 2.6million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{states in}} American Creations {{foreword}} {{that the book}} was prompted by repeated questions he received on his 2000 book tour for Founding Brothers negatively comparing presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore to the Founders. His difficulty in properly assessing the Founders <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write a book that both acknowledged their achievements and punctured the myth that they were [...] "demigods". He stated {{in an interview that}} he wanted to show that [...] "these folks didn't completely understand what they were doing... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe." [...] Ellis did the research for the book personally, rather than working with research assistants. He wrote the manuscript by hand with a rollerball pen.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and {{why it was so}} personal to Jackson, who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} is Oona and Steph's birthday, {{and their parents}} throw them a party, {{inviting}} Mikey and Dan. Steph and Oona, still fighting, arrive separately. Oona looks for Steph, but sees Dan. Her TiMER goes off, because Dan purchased a TiMER: being with Steph <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be alone. Mikey runs off before Oona can talk to him, and Oona finds Steph and Dan arguing. The sisters fight and Oona leaves.|$|R
50|$|Sérgio Britto {{recorded}} the first take of his lead vocals while overhearing {{a conversation between}} producer Liminha and Evandro Mesquita about spearfishing, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> angry.

5000|$|Prior {{to writing}} the trilogy Hough was greatly {{influenced}} by Joss Whedon's television series Firefly; Hough had enjoyed the show during its limited run, and the show's cancellation <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write books with a similar theme. Hough did not immediately begin writing the trilogy, as he felt [...] "in novel form the genre had largely alienated all but the hard-SF reader". He began writing after reading John Scalzi's Old Man's War (2005), which he stated showed him that the literary genre still had potential. While writing Hough tried to create a world that was [...] "equal parts The Stand and 2001" [...] that would be accessible to all readers. He chose set the trilogy in Darwin, Australia, as he [...] "needed a location near the equator, because otherwise a space elevator doesn’t work", and because the location had other things that appealed to him, such as the name's connotations and its melting pot-esque nature.|$|R
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "original" [...] or [...] "unique" [...] and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both [...] "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as [...] "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" [...] that fluctuated [...] "between humorous and poignant". GameZone David Sanchez thought its script was [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "sharp", as it displayed {{a wide range of}} emotions that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> talk to all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its [...] "strangely existential narrative framework".|$|E
500|$|Developers {{have cited}} Braid as an {{influence}} on their game design; The Guardian considered the game as the [...] "Sex, Lies, and Videotape" [...] of indie gaming, a potent symbol for the saleable potential of non-mainstream productions". Japanese video game developer Goichi [...] "Suda51" [...] Suda, developer of killer7 and No More Heroes, stated that playing Braid <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> try making a 2D title. Tim can be unlocked as a playable character in Super Meat Boy, a game designed by independent game developer Edmund McMillen who had previously created Gish and the original character designs for Braid. Braid has also garnered academic interest and acclaim for its complexity, with narratologists saying [...] "Anyone who thinks... the unique constraints of game play cannot possibly be used to best structure a story has probably not encountered Braid, which marries pure mechanics and story into a philosophical platform." [...] Braids use of narrative elements and puzzle-making {{has been compared to}} similar techniques of [...] "imperative storytelling" [...] in novels such as Life A User's Manual and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go back and rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
60|$|Something in Turnbull <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> {{suddenly}} <b>to</b> be sick on the grass; {{the mere}} healthy and heathen {{horror of the}} unclean; the mere inhumane hatred of the inhuman state of madness. He seemed to hear all round him the hateful whispers of that place, innumerable as leaves whispering in the wind, {{and each of them}} telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true. All the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite; and in some wild way, which I will not defend, he tried to do it.|$|R
50|$|Mikitani {{worked at}} the Industrial Bank of Japan (now part of Mizuho Corporate Bank) from 1988 to 1996, with a break from 1991 to 1993 to attend Harvard. He left {{to start his own}} {{consulting}} group, called Crimson Group. Mikitani has stated that the destruction caused by the devastating 1995 Kobe earthquake <b>made</b> <b>him</b> realize he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help revitalize Japan’s economy, leading to his resignation from banking and decision to launch his own venture.|$|R
50|$|Lennox {{was born}} in Knysna in 1983 {{and grew up in}} a very liberal and open-minded family. School years were spent at York High in Knysna and, after matriculating, Lennox spent a year interning at First National Bank which later led to his {{financial}} clerk position at George Municipality. Another year in finance <b>made</b> <b>him</b> realize he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> follow a more active path in life, so he further explored his sporting talents and enlisted in the Vodacom League Games (second division).|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut {{stating that the}} album features an [...] "inspired overhaul" [...] of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a [...] "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing" [...] and musicOMH calling it [...] "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes". Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Oram {{appears as}} Daniel, Sara's assistant. When asked what <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get {{involved}} in the project, Oram revealed that he had loved the script from the moment he read it and really liked his character. Oram called Daniel [...] "slightly misguided and psychopathic", but he has a good heart. Sara's other friends, Jamie and Justine, are portrayed by Dominic Coleman and Nicola Walker. Coleman auditioned for the role of Jamie, but was unsure if he would get the part as he did not have much in common with the character.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Kaufman and his {{business}} partner Michael Herz founded Troma Entertainment and began producing and distributing independent action and comedy films. In order to pay the bills, Kaufman did some freelance work for major Hollywood productions, including Rocky (edited on Troma's flatbed machines), Saturday Night Fever, and The Final Countdown, which he also produced (Kaufman {{has said that it}} was his experience on this film that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> deal with a major studio again). From 1979 to 1981, the two wrote, produced and directed a series of profitable [...] "sexy comedies" [...] including Squeeze Play!, Waitress!, Stuck on You! and The First Turn-On!. On most of these early films, Kaufman is credited as [...] "Samuel Weil." [...] Kaufman also made a small appearance in Rocky and served as the production manager on Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre.|$|R
5000|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{was mixed}} in his {{assessment}} of the record, writing [...] "There's certainly nothing wrong with a producer as talented as Terje feeling constrained by the style of music that's <b>made</b> <b>him</b> famous and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> spread his wings. It's just that the areas that Terje spreads his wings into feel a bit hackneyed." [...] On the album, Tim Senda of Allmusic wrote [...] "Terje should set aside the experiments and just focus on making sleek and shiny electro-disco tracks; the rest only {{gets in the way}} of a good time." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2008, {{a sequel}} to the 2007 remake was announced, with French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo in {{negotiations}} to direct. Instead, Zombie was resigned to write and direct the sequel, with the film taking place directly {{after the end of}} his remake. In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea. The writer/director explains that with the sequel, he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any [...] "John Carpenter-ness", as he could now do [...] "whatever [...] <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do". Instead of focusing on Michael, Zombie chose to look more at the psychological consequences on Laurie after the events of the remake. As Zombie explains, after Michael murdered her friends and family, Laurie became a [...] "wreck", who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward.|$|R
2500|$|As {{new wave}} pioneers, OMD {{influenced}} {{the music of}} popular artists like U2, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, a-ha, Erasure, Radiohead, No Doubt, Robyn, Information Society, Saint Etienne, Howard Jones, Sneaker Pimps, Death Cab for Cutie, Spoons, Karl Bartos, Nine Inch Nails, Yazoo, Naked Eyes, Talk Talk, Berlin, and Underworld precursor, Freur. Erasure instrumentalist Vince Clarke (formerly chief songwriter of Depeche Mode, Yazoo and The Assembly) has cited the band as his inspiration {{to pursue a career}} in electronic music, while BBC Radio's Steve Lamacq has named [...] "Electricity" [...] as the track that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become a DJ. Tony Kanal of No Doubt described OMD as [...] "geniuses".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Little Guy" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the episode. In his [...] "B+" [...] review, {{he claimed that}} the episode [...] "isn't great TV like the pilot, but it's a very enjoyable murder mystery for much of its running time". VanDerWerff added that the episode [...] "has some hiccups here and there". He criticized the final scene, adding that it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> [...] "punch" [...] something. Despite this, VanDerWerff thought that [...] "there was plenty of fun" [...] in the episode, other than the final two minutes". VanDerWerff stated that parts of the episode cannot be [...] "connected".|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Tezuka's arms swelled up and {{he became}} ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a doctor.

At the time, being a manga author was not a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: [...] "You should work doing the thing you like most of all." [...] Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as Black Jack.|$|E
5000|$|Marcantoni {{spent his}} early life {{moving up and}} down the East Coast, {{primarily}} in the south. He was involved in theatre from an early age and acted in community and semi-professional productions until the age of 21, when he decided to dedicate himself solely to writing and filmmaking. When he was eighteen, he starred as Louis Ironside in a production of Angels in America, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> briefly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a professional actor. He went on to join Behind the Masque, a street performance group, which ended a year later when the founder and Marcantoni's mentor, Jaime Burcham, died in a drowning accident. Jaime's death made Marcantoni reconsider his creative path and he began to focus on script writing, which led him to attend the Art Institute of Atlanta. He was joined at the school by high school friend Todd Carnley, and together they made several short films. He attended the school for only three months, leaving to pursue freelance work in Atlanta's film community.|$|R
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} be almost crying, and Pony laughed and said: [...] "Why, nothing {{could happen to you}} with shooting-crackers"; and she could have the powder to keep for him; and he would just make a snake with it Fourth of July night; put it around through the grass, loose, and then light one end of it, and she would see how it would go off and not make the least noise. But she said she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it; only he must be careful; and she kissed him again and let him go, and when he got away he could see her wiping her eyes. It seemed to him that she was crying a good deal in those days, and he could not {{understand}} what it was about. She was scared at any little thing, and would whoop at the least noise, and when his father would say: [...] "Lucy, my dear girl!" [...] she would burst out crying and say that she could not help it. But she got better and better to Pony all the time, and it was this that now <b>made</b> <b>him</b> ashamed with Jim Leonard, because it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> run off so much.|$|R

[...] Jackson also felt that the couple's relationship was crucial to Lucky's growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to Soaps In Depth in 1999: [...] "I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a sense of peace that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> mend things with his parents more. I don't think he would have done it otherwise." [...] When Jackson left the series in April 1999, Lucky and Elizabeth's teenage romance ends as Lucky is presumed dead in a fire.

Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children. Herbst explained portraying the relationship through different actors to Comcast in 2010: [...] "The characters are still the same. Each individual actor chose to play him a little differently. You just roll with it. Each relationship was different. They all had their uniqueness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} different people. Taylor stated that [...] "I Feel Better" [...] was based on Joe Goddard [...] "listening to Susan Boyle on TV and [...] thought of [...] string melody [...] by kind of misremembering [...] Les Misérables song". Following this, Taylor wrote the chorus, which he described as sounding like [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] by Madonna. This was not the only song to be influenced by Boyle; [...] "Keep Quiet" [...] was written by Goddard immediately after seeing Boyle perform [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] on Britain's Got Talent. Goddard said he [...] "found it quite incredible" [...] and listening to it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write a song, which he sent to Taylor, who wrote the words and sent it back." [...] Taylor stated that though the song [...] "Alley Cats" [...] {{was influenced by}} the song [...] "That's Us/Wild Combination" [...] by Arthur Russell, which he and Goddard both like, the sound of the finished version was [...] "something a bit more Fleetwood Mac-y". Taylor said that a new bass line, which gave the song a different feel, was responsible for the transformation. Taylor said [...] "We Have Love" [...] had a similar feel to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] "in terms of the euphoria of the chorus", which he described as being [...] "reminiscent of that".|$|E

In 1983, there was a rumor that Paramount billed the fourth installment as [...] "The Final Chapter" [...] as they felt embarrassed by their association with the series, thus the possible reason for the moniker. Despite how Siskel & Ebert claimed this in their review of the film, Paramount was aware that the slasher genre had been losing interest {{and thought it was}} a good choice to conclude the series. However, the idea came from Frank Mancuso, Jr. (the son of Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr.), as he had begun to resent the series due to how he felt everyone saw him as only doing the work for Part 2 and Part 3 and that no one respected him for it, regardless of how much money it <b>made.</b> Because of <b>him</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> work on different projects, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> conclude the series and kill off Jason.|$|R

Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention, when they believed Zombie was not returning, was to create a [...] "normal sequel". Akkad and his Trancus producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film, but none worked. Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and Muary, whose film Inside had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company. According to Akkad, the producers really <b>wanted</b> Zombie <b>to</b> return, as Akkad felt that there was something [...] "lost in the translation" [...] when the French filmmakers took over the project.
