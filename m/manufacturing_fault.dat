500|$|Charizard {{has been}} {{featured}} in lines of soft toys and action figures in the Pokémon franchise, made by Hasbro, and Tomy. In 2004, the [...] "Charizard Medium Plush" [...] {{was part of a}} major recall of 13 plush toys due to a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> where tips of needles were being found with the stuffing. This allowed Tomy to replace the toys with compensation or replacements. Charizard appears often in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, most notably in the series' initial release. Cards featuring the character have been stated to be the most desired of the series, quickly rising to high prices amongst collectors and retailers. These cards overpowered and knocked out opponents in one hit. In 2005, search engine Yahoo! reported Charizard as [...] "one of the top Pokémon-related web searches".|$|E

40|$|A {{commonly}} used model for fault-tolerant computation {{is that of}} cellular automata. The essential difficulty of fault-tolerant computation {{is present in the}} special case of simply remembering a bit in the presence of faults, and that is the case we treat in this paper. The conceptually simplest mechanism for correcting errors in a cellular automaton is to determine the next state of a cell by taking a majority vote among its neighbors (including the cell itself, if necessary to break ties). We are interested in which regular two-dimensional tessellations can tolerate faults using this mechanism, when the fault rate is sufficiently low. We consider both the traditional transient fault model (where faults occur independently in time and space) and a recently introduced combined fault model which also includes <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> (which occur independently in space, but which affect cells for all time). We completely classify regular two-dimensional tessellations as to whether they can tolerate combined transient and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults,</b> transient <b>faults</b> but not <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults,</b> or not even transient faults.

50|$|Deliveries to the Wehrmacht {{began in}} October 1944 but the mine was not issued to combat troops until January 1945 due to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults.</b> Only 59,000 were built {{because it was}} felt that the warheads were better {{employed}} with the proven Panzerfaust technology.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 {{delivery}} of the ships' Aster missiles was delayed due to a failure during testing. A subsequent investigation revealed a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> with a single batch of missiles, making {{delivery of}} the Aster 30 possible in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Failing high is {{invariably}} {{a result}} of a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> or mechanical damage. In rebreathers, failing high will result in the rebreather assuming that there is more oxygen in the loop than there actually is which results in hypoxia.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of Sky+ HD Digibox were produced by Thomson, with Sky subsequently adding Samsung, Pace and Amstrad as manufacturers afterwards. In 2009, a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> led to a batch of up to 90,000 units manufactured by Pace requiring replacement; Sky offered customers 3 months free HD pack subscription for the inconvenience.|$|E
5000|$|Although such {{failure is}} {{associated}} with end of life, an arc tube can fail at any time even when new, because of unseen <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> such as microscopic cracks. However, this is quite rare. Manufacturers typically [...] "season" [...] new lamps to check for such defects before the lamps leave the manufacturer's premises.|$|R
40|$|As {{computational}} systems {{scale to}} arbitrarily large sizes, {{and as they}} are expected to function reliably for arbitrary lengths of time, there are certain realities of the physical world that can not be ignored in the design and modeling of computational systems. For example, considerations for the delivery of power and removal of heat seem to limit the system to a two-dimensional surface. Additionally, {{it can be argued that}} all of the following restrictions are desirable and reasonable: there is a finite variety of components, no components (or external agents) are immune to failure, and components can communicate only with a bounded number of other components over a bounded distance. A very general model, with a reasonable ability to capture many of these features, is that of a cellular automaton. We extend the widely studied model of transient faults (which occur independently at different places and different times) in cellular automata to consider <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> (which occur independently at different places, but affect cells for all time). Although a well known monotone binary transition rule (known as Toom’s Rule) in two dimensions can remember a bit (that is, the system can be used to preserve a single Boolean value for all time with probability one) in the presence of transient faults, we show that no monotone binary transition rule in two dimensions can remember a bit when both <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> and transient faults are present. On the other hand, we give a monotone binary transition rule in three dimensions that can remember a bit in the presence of both <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> and transient faults. (By adding one or two further dimensions, one can reduce the problem of performing an arbitrary computation reliably to the problem of remembering a single bit.) We also study cellular automata that are based on hyperbolic (rather than Euclidean) tessellations (including infinite regular trees), and we completely classify the cases in which majority voting among all nearest neighbors can tolerate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> and/or transient faults. ii...|$|R
50|$|Iddq {{testing is}} a method for testing CMOS {{integrated}} circuits {{for the presence of}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults.</b> It relies on measuring the supply current (Idd) in the quiescent state (when the circuit is not switching and inputs are held at static values).

50|$|Some proprietors {{replaced}} the Land Rover engine with the Perkins/Mazda 2977 cc diesel, which improved {{the performance of}} the cab dramatically. Whilst powerful and reliable, the Perkins conversion gained a reputation for being noisy at idle and, mistakenly for causing cracks in the chassis. The chassis problem, which was also occurring on late model Austins was traced to a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E

50|$|A common Trojan is passive for {{the most}} time-span an altered device is in use, but the {{activation}} can cause a fatal damage. If a Trojan is activated the functionality can be changed, the device can be destroyed or disabled, it can leak confidential information or tear down the security and safety. Trojans are stealthy, that means the precondition for activation is a very rare event. Traditional testing techniques are not sufficient. A <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> happens at a random position while malicious changes are well placed to avoid detection.|$|E
50|$|Moodie {{finished}} {{first in the}} 2008 World Championship, but was subsequently disqualified and suspended from racing after scrutineering revealed a problem with his carburettor. Moodie proclaimed his innocence and later investigations revealed {{that there was a}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault</b> in a batch of carburettors, of which Moodie’s was one. However, Moodie remained suspended and his lack of racing meant that he did not win the National Points Championship in both 2008 and 2009. A four-month ban imposed towards the end of 2014 saw Moodie miss {{the first half of the}} 2015 season, ruling him out of contention for the National Points Championship in 2015.|$|E
50|$|There exist {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the C64DTV. DTV1 (NTSC television type) comes with 2 MB ROM. It first appeared in late 2004 for the American/Canadian market. DTV2 (called C64D2TV sometimes) is a revised version for the European and world markets (PAL television type) and appeared in late 2005. The ROM {{has been replaced by}} flash memory in these devices. However, the DTV2/PAL version suffers from a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>fault,</b> which results in poor colour rendering (the resistors in the R-2R ladder DACs for both the chroma and the luma have been transposed).

50|$|Iddq testing {{uses the}} {{principle}} that in a correctly operating quiescent CMOS digital circuit, there is no static current path between the power supply and ground, except for {{a small amount of}} leakage. Many common semiconductor <b>manufacturing</b> <b>faults</b> will cause the current to increase by orders of magnitude, which can be easily detected. This has the advantage of checking the chip for many possible faults with one measurement. Another advantage is that it may catch faults that are not found by conventional stuck-at fault test vectors.|$|R
