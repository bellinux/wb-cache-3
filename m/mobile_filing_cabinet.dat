50|$|A <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> (or {{sometimes}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> in American English) is a {{piece of}} office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are vertical <b>files</b> and lateral files. A vertical <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the <b>cabinet.</b> A lateral <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, <b>file</b> <b>cabinets</b> are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> This <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> uses electronic information {{to augment the}} physical world. By using a scanner to transform documents into electronic files, the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> can index the documents on visual and textual information. The selforganized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> helps the user find the documents at a later date. The focus of this thesis is on the design and evaluation of the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> User studies show that this tool is natural to use.

5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for vertical <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for lateral <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|R
50|$|To use {{the example}} of a {{physical}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> if the separate drawers in the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> within the room.|$|R

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of wireless network and mobile computing, there is an increasing {{need to build a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>file</b> system that can perform efficiently and correctly for accessing online information.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a <b>mobile</b> <b>file</b> system on an open platform, the Linux kernel, and at the same time, our <b>mobile</b> <b>file</b> system is compatible to the popular NFS 2. 0 protocol. In this paper, we formally define the file semantics of our <b>mobile</b> <b>file</b> system, which we called the NFS/M. We also specify the conditions of object con ict as well as our conflict resolution algorithms. NFS/M supports client side caching, data prefetching, file system service during the disconnected mode, data reintegration and conflict resolution on various le system objects. Since theNFS/M is based on an open platform, it serves as a basic building block for developing future mobile computing applications...|$|R
