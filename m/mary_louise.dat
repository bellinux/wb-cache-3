5|$|Governor Ford's allies {{encouraged}} Carroll {{to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1974, but Carroll {{had already}} set his sights on the governorship. Instead, Ford ran for and won the Senate seat, and Carroll succeeded him as governor. In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Jefferson County Judge Todd Hollenbach, former state Auditor <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.|$|E
6000|$|They {{picked up}} the cans together, Ingua growing more calm and cheerful each moment. She even laughed at <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> {{disappointed}} expression and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{wrong with}} my talk?" [...] she demanded. She was annoyed at the suggestion, {{because she had been}} earnestly trying to imitate <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> speech.|$|R
60|$|It was now <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> turn to reflect, {{seeking an}} answer. Presently she {{realized}} that a logical explanation of her grandfather's action was impossible with her present knowledge.|$|R
5|$|Ford {{entered the}} Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992. In the 1980 primary, Ford {{received}} only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart. He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries. Republicans failed {{to put forward}} a viable challenger during any of Ford's re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> Foust by 334,862 votes. Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 {{percent of the total}} votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties. State senator David L. Williams fared little better in 1992, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford (63 percent).|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E

60|$|And so <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> Liberty Girls, at {{the time}} this story ends, are still active workers {{in the cause of}} liberty, justice and democracy, and will {{continue}} to support their country's welfare {{as long as they can}} be of use.|$|R
60|$|She spoke earnestly, with {{a ring of}} sincerity in {{her voice}} that {{impressed}} the other girl. Ingua's anger had melted {{as quickly as it}} had roused and with sudden impulsiveness she seized <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> hands in her own and began to cry.|$|R
60|$|But {{they could}} not find the girl {{anywhere}} in the hotel. After a long and careful search for her, Colonel Hathaway left word at the desk that if his room or <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> room was called, to report that they would be found in the breakfast room.|$|R

60|$|Colonel Hathaway {{had stayed}} because {{he noted the}} leading look in <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> eyes. He was himself {{interested}} in Alora and indignant over her evident neglect. For her sake he would bear the insolence of his host, an insolence he recognized as characteristic of the man.|$|R
60|$|Peter Conant was so astounded {{he could}} do nothing but stare at the detective. Staring was the very best thing that Peter did and he never stared harder in his life. The tears had been {{coursing}} down <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> cheeks, but now a glad look crossed her face.|$|R
60|$|Alora {{was delighted}} at the {{prospect}} of a yachting trip and decided at once that she would go, especially as Colonel Hathaway said she would be <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> guest on the trip to Chicago and no money would be needed for expenses. So she attacked her father in a somewhat original manner.|$|R
25|$|Historically, Cloughjordan National School {{opened in}} 1876. Its first {{teachers}} were Joseph and <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> MacDonagh, parents of Thomas MacDonagh, succeeded by Denis Costello, father of Michael Joe Costello.|$|E
25|$|Díaz met Feliz Amada {{and married}} her in 1929 {{in the newly}} {{constructed}} Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church. The couple had four children, <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise,</b> Sally (Díaz) Feight, Olivia, and José.|$|E

6000|$|During <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> absence Irene had had {{a strange}} and startling {{experience}} with their beautiful neighbor. The girl had wheeled her chair out upon the bluff to sun herself and read, Mrs. Conant being busy in the house, when Agatha Lord strolled up to her {{with a smile and}} a pleasant [...] "good morning." ...|$|R
60|$|So many {{of these}} quaint notions filled {{the head of the}} {{crippled}} girl that <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> wondering interest in her never flagged. It was easy to understand why Mrs. Conant had declared that Irene was the joy and life of the household, for it was impossible to remain morbid or blue in her presence.|$|R
60|$|I {{am quite}} {{sure it is}} {{unnecessary}} to relate in detail the scene that followed <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> introduction or the excited inquiries and explanations which naturally ensued. To those present the scene was intensely dramatic and never to be forgotten, but such a meeting between father and daughter is considered too sacred to be described here.|$|R
25|$|Passengers {{on board}} {{included}} Mr. and Mrs. Walts of San Francisco, Mr. V. Krause, Jay Tracy Dirlam and <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> Dirlam (brother and sister who both attended Stanford University), and Mr. M. H. Salisbury, a TWA pilot.|$|E

60|$|Having {{read this}} with {{considerable}} surprise the girl handed the note to Mr. Conant, who slowly {{read it and}} gave a bark like that of an angry dog {{when he came to}} the name of the California attorney. Without remark he put the detective's letter in his pocket and picking up <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> suit case led the girl outside to the street corner.|$|R
60|$|These residences, all having ample {{grounds and}} facing the creek on either side, were {{sufficiently}} scattered to be secluded, {{and it was}} {{to one of the}} most imposing of these that Uncle Eben guided the automobile. He crossed the creek on a primitive but substantial bridge, turned to the right, and the first driveway led to the house that was to be <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> temporary home.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{turned and}} looked into <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> face long and earnestly. Her eyes wandered to her neatly {{arranged}} hair, to the white collar at her throat, then down to her blue serge dress and her dainty shoes. But mostly she looked straight {{into the eyes of}} her new friend and found there sincerity and evident good will. So she sighed deeply, cast a glance at her own bedraggled attire, and said: ...|$|R
25|$|Roberts and {{his wife}} <b>Mary</b> <b>Louise</b> had two daughters, Mary Wendy Roberts and Leslie Roberts. The couple {{divorced}} prior to 1960, the year Frank married Betty Cantrell Rice, then {{a single mother of}} four and teacher in Portland.|$|E

60|$|<b>Mary</b> <b>Louise's</b> intuition had {{not played}} her false. She had {{found at the}} Congress Hotel another Jason Jones, far {{different}} from the one she had known, and a few questions elicited {{the fact that he was}} indeed the father of Alora. So, as briefly as she could, she told him how another man had usurped his place and seized all of Alora's income, at the same time willfully depriving the girl of such comforts and accomplishments as one in her position should enjoy.|$|R
