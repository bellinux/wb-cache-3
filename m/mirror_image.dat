40|$|Background: Mental {{rotation}} is {{a spatial}} representation conversion capability using an imagined object and either object or self-rotation. This capability is impaired in schizophrenia. Objective: To {{provide a more}} detailed assessment of impaired cognitive functioning in schizophrenia by comparing the electrophysiological profiles of patients with schizophrenia and controls while completing a mental rotation task using both normally-oriented <b>images</b> and <b>mirror</b> <b>images.</b> Methods: This electroencephalographic study compared error rates, reaction times and the topographic map of event-related potentials in 32 participants with schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls during mental rotation tasks involving both normal <b>images</b> and <b>mirror</b> <b>images.</b> Results: Among controls the mean error rate and the mean reaction time for normal <b>images</b> and <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> {{were not significantly different}} but in the patient group the mean (sd) error rate was higher for <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> than for normal images (42 % [6 %] vs. 32 % [9 %], t= 2. 64, p= 0. 031) and the mean reaction time was longer for <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> than for norma...|$|R
40|$|In {{our former}} work (Kolinsky, Verhaeghe, Fernandes, Mengarda, Grimm-Cabral, & Morais, 2011), {{we showed that}} adults who {{remained}} illiterate for socio-economic reasons have difficulties at processing lateral <b>mirror</b> <b>images.</b> This probably {{reflects the fact that}} the Latin alphabet requires taking mirror-image contrasts into account, in order to distinguish e. g. “b” from “d”, and hence that its acquisition pushes the beginning reader to “unlearn” the mirror symmetry invariance that characterizes our visual system. In addition, our results suggested that the illiterate’s difficulties with orientation were not general: they had stronger difficulties with <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> than with other orientation contrasts like rotations in the plane. In the present study, we aimed at extending the latter result by using other materials and another task. In Experiment 1, we compared two groups of illiterates, both being required to sort circles on the basis of either their size or their orientation. Orientation contrasts involved <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> in one group and a vertical vs. horizontal difference in the other group, angular separation being the same in both cases. Illiterates were indeed slower at sorting on orientation than on size. Yet, as labeling could have been easier with the vertical-horizontal contrast than with <b>mirror</b> <b>images,</b> in Experiment 2 we used a part-verification task in which we compared <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> to images rotated in the plane. The illiterates’ performance was worse with <b>mirror</b> <b>images</b> than with plane rotations. Thus, illiterates do not have general difficulties with orientation contrasts, but rather specific difficulties for discriminating lateral <b>mirror</b> <b>images.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German {{submarines}} which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy aircraft flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt submarines, {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in an ironic twist, the U.S. submarines fought against Japanese shipping in a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> of the Atlantic, with U.S. submarines hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the}} war the U.S. had 260 submarines in commission. It had lost 52 submarines during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. Submarines effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and choked off Japan's oil supply.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is the <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> of {{that found}} in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the truncated square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the truncated square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this {{can be explained by}} saying that the truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around the center of each tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} superpose it on top of its <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> using only translations and rotations.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a <b>mirror</b> <b>image.</b> Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
