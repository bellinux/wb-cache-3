25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, {{such as having}} a conversation or doing work, they are using their working memory to help them complete this task. As they age, their ability to <b>multi-task</b> seems to decline; thus after an interruption it is often more difficult for an aging individual to successfully finish the task at hand. Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E

40|$|<b>Multi-tasking</b> is an {{important}} skill for clinical work which has received limited research attention. Its impacts on clinical work are poorly understood. In contrast, there is substantial <b>multi-tasking</b> research in cognitive psychology, driver distraction, and human-computer interaction. This review synthesises evidence of the extent and impacts of <b>multi-tasking</b> on efficiency and task performance from health and non-healthcare literature, to compare and contrast approaches, identify implications for clinical work, and to develop an evidence-informed framework for guiding the measurement of <b>multi-tasking</b> in future healthcare studies. The results showed healthcare studies using direct observation have focused on descriptive studies to quantify concurrent <b>multi-tasking</b> and its frequency in different contexts, with limited study of impact. In comparison, non-healthcare studies have applied predominantly experimental and simulation designs, focusing on interleaved and concurrent <b>multi-tasking,</b> and testing theories of the mechanisms by which <b>multi-tasking</b> impacts task efficiency and performance.

In May 2004, the bank successfully bred one of the world's most critically endangered turtles, the Indian painted roof turtle, Batagur kachuga, {{for the first time ever}} in captivity. The species is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and is listed under the Action Plan Rating I of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. The bank is home to another near endemic Batagur turtle, Batagur baska. Incidentally, recent evidence suggests that this species is extinct in the wild and only 13 individuals remain in captivity, including 4 adult females of which 2 are at the CrocBank. The bank sends 50% of its stock of the red-crowned roof turtle to the Uttar Pradesh forest department to introduce into the wild. In 2004, concerned parties created the Gharial <b>Multi-Task</b> Force (renamed to Gharial Conservation Alliance in 2008) to create a specialist organization dedicated to saving gharials from extinction.|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the <b>multi-task</b> oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

40|$|Preemptive <b>multi-tasking</b> is a {{commonly}} used architecture for designing and implementing embedded real-time software. However, preemptive <b>multi-tasking</b> comes {{with its own}} costs. These costs include overheads due to preemptions and context-switches that result in waste of CPU bandwidth. Also, each task incurs a memory cost {{largely due to the}} need to maintain a separate stack for each task. These costs increase with the number of tasks and can be significant in complex real-time software. In this paper, we propose results from our ongoing research in which we are developing a design method with scalable <b>multi-tasking</b> implementations for complex realtime software. Our design method is based on an extension of fixed priority preemptive scheduling using preemption thresholds that was proposed in [15].

This is achieved by time-sharing, dividing the available processor time between multiple processes that are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. <b>Multi-tasking</b> may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot {{to each of the}} programs. Unix-like operating systems, e.g., Solaris, Linux, as well as AmigaOS support preemptive multitasking.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Multi-tasking,</b> managed runtime environments (MREs) {{for modern}} type-safe, {{object-oriented}} programming languages enable isolated, concurrent execution of multiple applications {{within a single}} operating system process. <b>Multi-tasking</b> MREs can potentially extract high-performance on modern desktop and hand-held systems through aggressive sharing of classes and compiled code, and by exploiting high-level dynamic program information for optimization across program executions. In this paper, we investigate {{the performance of a}} state-of-the-art multi-taking MRE for concurrent program execution and find that due to limited support for <b>multi-tasking</b> and performance isolation in the memory management subsystem, <b>multi-tasking</b> performs poorly compared to a production-quality, singletasking MRE. To address this limitation, we present MTM 2 : a comprehensive memory management system for concurrent <b>multi-tasking.</b> MTM 2 facilitates performance isolation and efficient heap space usage through on-demand allocation of application-private regions. Moreover, MTM 2 mitigates fragmentation using a novel hybrid garbage collector that combines mark-sweep with opportunistic copying. Our empirical evaluation shows that MTM 2 improves overall performance, scalability, and footprint for concurrent workloads over state-of-the-art, multi- and single-tasking MREs. ...|$|R
