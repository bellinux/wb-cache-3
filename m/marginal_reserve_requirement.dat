40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{interdependence}} between central bank and commercial bank goals. The basic central bank task is to achieve and to maintain price stability. Croatian external debt has been increasing for years and so {{the activities of the}} Croatian National Bank are designed to correct this situation. In order to stop the further increase of the external debt, the Croatian National Bank uses several monetary policy instruments, among which is the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement.</b> On the other hand, the goal of commercial banks is to maximise profits. Banks take loans from abroad at a lower interest rate and invest this money in Croatia at a higher interest rate, thus fulfilling their goal. In order to obtain the desired effects of the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement,</b> its optimal percentage value should be determined. This problem is modelled as a bi-level mixed 0 - 1 programming problem. The objective of the leader (Croatian National Bank) is to minimize the increase in household loans by setting different percentages of the reserve requirements for loans extended to households and for those granted to enterprises. The objective of the followers (banks) is to maximize profits. In order to solve this NP-hard problem a heuristic is proposed. In order to verify the model, the paper ends with simulations and the presentation of computational results. monetary policy instruments, commercial banks credit activity, <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement,</b> bi-level mixed 0 - 1 programming problem, NP-hard problem, heuristic...|$|E

Although quantitative analysis is complicated by substantial overlaps among measures, the econometric results in this paper suggest that the measures were most effective in requiring banks to hold high liquidity and capital buffers, and less effective in slowing credit growth and capital inflows. Larger buffers seem to have helped Croatian banks weather the financial crisis, making the adjustments to capital and liquidity during the crisis smaller.

40|$|The {{prospects}} of expansionary monetary {{policies in the}} advanced countries {{for the foreseeable future}} have renewed the debate over policy options to cope with large capital inflows that are, at least partly, driven by low interest rates in the financial centers. Historically, capital flow bonanzas have often fueled sharp credit expansions in advanced and emerging market economies alike. Focusing primarily on emerging markets, we analyze the impact of exchange rate flexibility on credit markets during periods of large capital inflows. We show that bank credit grows more rapidly and its composition tilts to foreign currency in economies with less flexible exchange rate regimes, and that these results are not explained entirely {{by the fact that the}} latter attract more capital inflows than economies with more flexible regimes. Our findings thus suggest countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes may stand to benefit the most from regulatory policies that reduce banks'' incentives to tap external markets and to lend/borrow in foreign currency; these policies include <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> on foreign lending, currency-dependent liquidity requirements, and higher capital requirement and/or dynamic provisioning on foreign exchange loans.

The paper develops an integrated accounting framework for the measurement of implicit and explicit taxes on the banking system and applies that framework to the Italian experience during the 1980 s. Pointing to a lack of transparency in the yield and incidence of the reserve requirement tax, the results reinforce the case for lowering the attendant burden on the Italian banking system. It is estimated that that burden could be halved at a cost to the budget of no more than 0. 2 percent of GDP.

40|$|The Peruvian {{financial}} system is highly dollarized {{with more than}} 50 per cent of deposits held in dollars. The structure and operation of the payment system reflect this financial dollarization. Not only does it settle payments in local and foreign currency, but the Intraday Financial Facility (IFF), through which the Central Bank provides liquidity to assure the uninterrupted operation of the payment system, reflects as well the {{financial system}} dollarization. Thus, due to the high dollar composition of deposits in the financial system, banks keep large amounts of dollar liquidity at the Central Bank, so as to meet the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> of 30 per cent, while the lower soles share of deposits {{as well as the}} minimum requirement to maintain 1 per cent deposited at the Central Bank, makes the soles liquidity of banks insufficient to settle all the transactions undertaken by the payment system, which for the most part are carried out in local currency, in spite of the financial dollarization. This situation leads the banks to utilize the IFF by means mainly of foreign currency swaps, given the ample availability of dollar liquidity. Nevertheless, the gradual dedollarization and the increasing bankarization are reducing the need to utilize the IFF. It is worth noting that at present not only foreign currency liquidity but also the holdings of Central Bank and Government securities are ensuring that the financial system is able {{to make use of the}} IFF and have the excess liquidity in order to settle total payments, both in local and foreign currency, thus enabling the payment system to run smoothly and efficiently.

40|$|International investors' enthusiasm {{with respect}} to growth {{prospects}} in Southeast Asia has been followed by panic. Both the outstanding economic performance of Southeast Asian economies {{and their ability to}} master adjustment challenges had led most observers of these economies to the conclusion that "Asia is different". In comparison with previous currency crises, the macroeconomic fundamentals (GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, external indebtedness, domestic savings, export performance) in the Southeast Asian economies seemed to be consistent with the fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Even large current account deficits were not classified as "high risk" although the vulnerability of Southeast Asian countries had increased during the last decade due to a surge in capital inflows, a construction boom, the appreciation of the US dollar, and the liberalization of domestic financial markets without strict enforcement of prudential standards. Early signals of vulnerability should have warned domestic policymakers to take precautionary measures such as more exchange rate flexibility to end sterilization policies, higher <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> and prudential standards for bank lending to reduce the risk exposure of banks. Some of these measures were taken in 1996, but apparently it was too little or too late. In the aftermath of the crisis, the enforcement of prudential rules in the financial sector and the clearing of bad debt figure high on the policy agenda. In order to help financial restructuring, fiscal and monetary policies should not be overly restrictive. The role of external assistance is ambiguous because of negative incentive effects. The currency crises in Asia boosted the amounts of emergency lending by the IMF and other countries, which may raise expectations that defaults will become cheaper in the future. Moreover, officially implemented early warning systems may easily produce the bad news which triggers exchange rate crises. All in all, Asia is not different from other regions. High current account deficits and real appreciation expose countries with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rates and fragile domestic financial markets to the risk of a reversal of capital inflows. This mounting risk position can lead to a crisis when bad news arrives and domestic measures are delayed. Therefore, Asia could have learned from previous currency crises in Latin America and Europe: first, extreme solutions for the exchange rate regime (currency boards or a passive crawling peg with wide intervention bands) work best; second, deregulated goods and factor markets with strict prudential supervision (especially in the phase of financial liberalization) are necessary preconditions for a stable fixed exchange rate regime; third, development models with discretionary government interventions face difficult times since the globalization of goods and factor markets renders economic plans of today obsolete tomorrow.

It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks during periods of financial distress and tranquil times. Using differences in bank ownership as a proxy for financial constraints, the paper finds weak evidence that foreign banks have a lower sensitivity of credit to monetary conditions relative to their domestic competitors, with the differences driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. The lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to be smoother during periods of financial distress. However, the differences across domestic and foreign banks {{do not appear to be}} strong. These results provide weak support to the existence of supply-side effects in credit markets and suggest that foreign bank entry in emerging countries may have contributed somewhat to stability in credit markets.

The first part of the paper focuses on <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> in a broader context of the monetary policy of the SBCS, the CNB respectively, during the period 1989 - 1998.

This critical analyse of the role of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> in monetary policy schemes during recent years creates a useful framework for the second part.

40|$|The {{discussion}} in many {{money and banking}} textbooks {{would suggest that the}} Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to hold a minimum level of non-interest-earning reserves because (1) <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> are a monetary policy tool that allows the Fed to expand the money supply and lower interest rates, and (2) <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> improve the safety and soundness of depository institutions. This article argues that this "conventional wisdom" view is too narrow.; The Fed often uses <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> changes, the authors contend, to achieve non-monetary-policy objectives, as it did in 1992 to improve the profitability of depository institutions and ease the credit crunch of that time.

40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} effects of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> on {{financial}} loans {{in the presence of}} moral hazard on the lender side (i. e., the anticipation that the taxpayer will bailout lending banks if large default will occur) and sovereign risk on the borrower side. The impacts of such <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> on the equilibrium degree of default risk and borrowing are analyzed, and their welfare implications for both the borrowing and the lending nations discussed. More generous bailouts financed by the high income block encourage borrowing and increase the probability of default. We show that the introduction of a <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> in either country reduces the risk of default and raises the welfare of both the high income block and the emerging market economies. In these circumstances, the lender's optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> is shown to increase with the expected bailout. Such a policy induces the lender to internalize the expected tax payer cost of the bailout. Thus a more generous bailout that is accompanied by an optimal adjustment in the lender's <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> exactly neutralizes its effects on welfare, leaving welfare in both countries unchanged. Unlike the case of the lender, the effect of the more generous bailout on the borrower's optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> is ambiguous. The imposition of the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> may also improve the availability of information about the debt exposure of the emerging market economies, which by itself will reduce the optimal lender's <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> and may prevent drying up' the market for sovereign debt. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{disadvantages}} of currency boards is the rule-based character of this system and the resulting inflexibility in case of shocks, a frequently recurring event in transition countries. Accordingly, central banks under currency board arrangements (CBA) are unable to respond to short-term liquidity changes in the money market. To cushion negative effects of economic shocks on interest rates and on the volatility of banks' liquidity the Estonian and Lithuanian central banks have to a limited extent used various monetary policy tools which, however, have neither undermined credibility of the central banks nor {{the ultimate goal of}} price stability. The most important instrument has been <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements.</b> Changes of the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> base, the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio and several other rules to hold <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> have affected the liquidity of the banking systems in both countries. The significance of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> becomes clear when <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> are set in relation to the monetary base. Between 1998 and 2000 in Estonia this ratio even ranged between 40 and 50 percent and Lithuania this ratio amounted to about 20 percent during this period. Other instruments than <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> played a minor role because the volume was small. [...] Monetary policy,currency board,exchange rate policy,transition economies...|$|R
