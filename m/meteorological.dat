5|$|After {{the season}} had ended, the name William was {{retired from the}} {{tropical}} cyclone naming lists, while in June 1995, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization made TCWC Nadi a Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> Center.|$|E
5|$|Stanley read {{many papers}} {{to the various}} societies, {{including}} Clocks (1876, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), The Mechanical Conditions of Storms, Hurricanes and Cyclones (1882, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), Forms of Movements in Fluids (1882, to the Physical Society of London), Integrating Anemometer (1883, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), Earth Subsidence and Elevation (1883, to the Physical Society of London), Certain effects {{which may have been}} produced from the eruptions of Krakatoa and Mount St. Augustin (1884, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), Improvement in Radiation Thermometers (1885, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), Three years' work with the chrono-barometer and chrono-thermometer (1886, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society), The Phonometer (1891, to the Royal <b>Meteorological</b> Society) and Perception of Colour (1893, to the Physical Society of London).|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} had ended, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization retired the name Kenna and {{replaced}} it with Karina.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged <b>meteorological</b> instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The <b>Meteorological</b> Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the <b>Meteorological</b> Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the <b>Meteorological</b> Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization retired {{no names}} {{used in the}} 1982 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the city is {{monitored}} by the Pakistan <b>Meteorological</b> Department. The Pakistan <b>Meteorological</b> Department regularly provides forecasts, public warnings and rainfall information to farmers {{with the assistance of}} the National Agromet Centre. Faisalabad has been classified as a hot desert climate (BWh) by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.|$|E
5|$|There are no <b>meteorological</b> {{conditions}} which would prevent fighters from taking off {{and engaging in}} combat.|$|E
5|$|There are six Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> Centers (RSMCs) worldwide. These {{organizations}} are {{designated by the}} World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization and are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins, warnings, and advisories about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility. In addition, there are six Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) that provide information to smaller regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} the Norwegian <b>Meteorological</b> Institute the same year {{concluded}} that the weather at Grøtnes was well-suited for an airport.|$|E
5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air <b>meteorological</b> observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of <b>meteorological</b> and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{conducted}} by Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station include environmental monitoring, geodesy/mapping, geomagnetic and <b>meteorological</b> observations, glaciology, biology, ionosphericauroral observations, limnology, geology, geophysics and seismology.|$|E
5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's <b>meteorological</b> observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His <b>meteorological</b> journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} had ended, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization's RA IV Hurricane Committee retired the name Andrew {{from the list}} of future names for Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones and replaced it with Alex.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French <b>meteorological</b> service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|Although the NHC is {{an agency}} of the United States, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization has {{designated}} it as Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> Center for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas. If the center loses power or becomes incapacitated, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific Ocean while the Weather Prediction Center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Although the National Hurricane Center {{does not}} {{consider}} it retired, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization lists Greta in its retired hurricane name list.|$|E
5|$|As Ewiniar {{cleared the}} Ryūkyū Islands {{and began to}} {{threaten}} the Korean Peninsula, the Korea <b>Meteorological</b> Administration issued typhoon warnings {{for most of the}} country. The KMA also issued typhoon advisories for Liancourt Rocks and Ulleungdo.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the damage and deaths caused by the storm, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization retired the name Maemi in 2006 and {{replaced}} it with Mujigae.|$|E
5|$|At 5a.m.AST (0900UTC) August 16 the {{respective}} governments of St. Lucia and Dominica issued hurricane warnings {{in anticipation of}} Hurricane Dean's imminent approach. In Dominica, a dozen and a half tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. At {{the same time the}} <b>Meteorological</b> Service of Barbados issued a tropical storm warning for Barbados and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent. Three hours later, at 8 a.m. AST (1200 UTC), the <b>Meteorological</b> Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm watch for Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Barbuda. Shortly thereafter the Trinidad and Tobago <b>Meteorological</b> Service issued a tropical storm watch for Grenada and its dependencies.|$|E
5|$|At {{their meeting}} {{in the spring of}} 1993, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization retired the name Andrew from the list above. The name that {{replaced}} it on the naming list for the 1998 season was Alex.|$|E
5|$|Ava {{was given}} the most {{advanced}} measurement and reconnaissance available at the time. Recon flights were conducted and <b>meteorological</b> equipment was tested. The hurricane was also photographed from space by satellites and Skylab astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the severe}} {{damage caused by}} the storm in Mexico, the name Manuel was later retired by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization, and will never be used again for an Eastern Pacific hurricane. It will be {{replaced}} with Mario for the 2019Pacifichurricaneseason.|$|E

5|$|Different <b>meteorological</b> factors {{affect the}} Argentine climate. Some {{of these factors}} are local while others come from other countries.|$|E
5|$|Due to its effects, {{the name}} Lenny was retired by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization {{and will never}} again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was {{replaced}} with Lee in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its impact}} on Martinique, the {{government}} of France requested the retirement of the name Klaus; the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization retired the name {{from the list of}} tropical cyclone names in the following year and replaced it with the name Kyle.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} and loss of life attributed to the hurricane, the name Hattie was retired by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} damage on Yap, the name Sudal was retired during the 38th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization typhoon {{committee}} in November 2005; it was replaced with the name Mirinae.|$|E
5|$|Due to the hurricane's extreme intensity, {{the name}} Patricia was retired by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization on April25, 2016. It will be {{replaced}} with Pamela for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the impact}} of this system, the name Daman was {{subsequently}} retired, from the list of names for the region by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization.|$|E
5|$|During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense {{requested}} {{the retirement of}} the name Daniel, citing that it {{became one of the}} several storms memorable for threat or damage. However, the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization did not approve the request.|$|E
5|$|During the year, the Japan <b>Meteorological</b> Agency (JMA) issued {{advisories}} on tropical cyclones {{west of the}} International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula, {{and north}} of the equator; {{this was due to}} the agency's status as the official Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> Center, as designated by the World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization in 1989. The JMA issued forecasts and analyses four times a day, beginning at 0000UTC and continuing every six hours. The JMA issued forecasts based on a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model. The agency estimated 10minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction. The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin, operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|Estelle was a well-observed storm, with Reconnaissance Aircraft {{flying into}} the {{hurricane}} to provide a fix on its location. It also passed near NOAA Buoy 51004 on July 22, providing valuable <b>meteorological</b> data for its future path.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian <b>Meteorological</b> Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for potentially affected areas. Subsequently, the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall, high winds, and rough seas. However, few citizens knew of {{the passage of the}} rare storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a <b>meteorological</b> station (see <b>Meteorological</b> Service of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.|$|E
