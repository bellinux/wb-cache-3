500|$|When {{asked if}} she thought Sarah had {{come to terms with}} the fact she is a lesbian, Batley said: [...] "I don't know because from the beginning, Sarah was always boy crazy, so for her, I don't think it's about being one way or the other — I think she's just very clingy. Batley also gave her views on how Sarah should have to developed, opining it would have been good for her to spend more time on her own, be herself and learn who she really is. She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E

60|$|On {{thinking}} {{things over}} I suspect I {{was not intended}} to appreciate the merits of British Columbia too highly. Maybe I misjudged; <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> purposely misrepresented; but I seemed to hear more about 'problems' and 'crises' and 'situations' in her borders than anywhere else. So far as eye or ear could gather, the one urgent problem was to find enough men and women to do the work in hand.|$|E

Some girls are holding needles and different material pieces in their hands (maybe they are knitting, sewing or stitching). One girl, wearing a dark dress, is standing with entangled arms close to the woman, watching to the woman's activity. The girl who is sitting rightmost, wearing a polka-dotted blouse and a dark skirt, is kneeling. Next to her a little basket, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> doing wickerwork.

60|$|She and the niece {{would have}} {{spirited}} arguments {{in his presence}} {{as to whether or}} not the cripple had one-stepped better after his third lesson than Henry after his fifth. The niece said no. As well, perhaps, but not better. Mme Gavarni said that the niece was forgetting the way the cripple had slid his feet. The niece said yes, that was so, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Henry said nothing. He merely perspired.|$|E
6000|$|In {{consideration}} of this, {{and of the}} agitation and unsettled state that had put the last week out of all common rules, she announced on Monday morning that she would excuse all the fines, and that all the children should have their allowance unbroken. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> moved to this by the suspicion that these four sixpences and three threepennies would make up the fund {{to the price of}} a [...] "reasonable pig;" [...] and she thought it time that David's perseverance should be rewarded, and room made in his mind for something beyond swine and halfpence.|$|E

Above and below was sheer cliff, and the track stretched ahead a hundred yards clear and empty. And then I spotted her, crouched down right against the cowcatcher, that close I'd almost stepped on her. If we'd started up, we'd have run over her in a second. It was all so nonsensical, I never could make out her actions. <b>Maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to suicide. I grabbed her by the wrist and jerked her none too gentle to her feet.

50|$|Nicesipolis or Nicasipolis of Pherae (Νικησίπολις Nikesipolis), was a Thessalian woman, {{native of}} the city Pherae, wife or {{concubine}} of king Philip II of Macedon and mother of Thessalonica of Macedon. There is not much surviving evidence about her background and life but she {{is likely to have}} been of noble Thessalian origin and <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a niece of Jason of Pherae.

5000|$|... "I {{once knew}} this girl who {{thought she was}} God. She didn't give sight to the blind or raise the dead. She didn't even teach {{anything}}, not really, and she never told me anything I probably didn't already know. On the other hand, she didn't expect to be worshiped, nor did she ask for money. Given her high opinion of herself, some might call that a miracle. I don't know, <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> God. Her name was Sati, and she had blonde hair and blue eyes." ...|$|E
5000|$|This Modern Age {{is notable}} also for Crawford playing a blonde.

When Rambeau became ill, the part was recast with a brunette actress, Pauline Frederick, whom Joan greatly admired. Joan's scenes had already been shot, and the difference in hair color was not reason enough to reshoot them. Besides, there was no reason why a brunette mother couldn't have a blonde-haired daughter - or <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just into peroxide." ...|$|E
