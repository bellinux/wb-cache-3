40|$|The {{richness}} of the option price data that is readily available to traders and others suggests the possibility of inverting this cross-sectional data to obtain a specification for a stochastic process that might be driving the observed prices. A number of such techniques have been introduced. They are attractive because they offer the prospect of specifying a stochastic process {{that is consistent with}} the observed term structure of volatility. The effectiveness of all of these approaches is, to some extent, affected by the spacing of the available option price observations in the time to <b>maturity</b> and strike <b>price</b> dimensions respectively. The Dupire (1993) approach is particularly sensitive in this regard because it depends upon using observed option prices to estimate the derivatives of option price with respect to time to <b>maturity</b> and strike <b>price.</b> All of the approaches are sensitive to the range of moneyness that is traded. Finally, all of the approaches to stochastic process specification considered in this paper assume that the stochastic process includes only one dimension of uncertainty.

More-over, we analyze the relationship between the free boundary and the pa-rameters in the problem, as well as, obtain the critical condition where the free boundary is a constant independent of time...|$|R
40|$|We {{assume that}} the {{instantaneous}} riskless rate reverts toward a central tendency which, in turn, is changing stochastically over time. As a result, current short-term rates are not sufficient to predict future short-term rate movements, {{as it would be}} the case if the central tendency were constant. However, since longer <b>maturity</b> bond <b>prices</b> incorporate information about the central tendency, longer maturity bond yields can be used to predict future short-term rate movements. We develop a two-factor model of the term structure which implies that a linear combination of any two rates {{can be used as a}} proxy for the central tendency. Based on this central-tendency proxy, we estimate a model of the one-month rate that performs better than models which assume the central tendency to be constant. © 1998 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

We allow the coefficients of the Taylor rule and the dynamics of inflation and output gap to be regime-dependent. We estimate the model using government bond yields and find that the Fed is proactive in controlling inflation in one regime but is accommodative for growth in another. Our model significantly improves the explanatory power of macroeconomic variables for government bond yields. Without the regimes, inflation and output can explain less than 50 % of the variations of contemporaneous bond yields. With the regimes, the two variables can explain more than 80 % of the variations of contemporaneous bond yields. Proactive mone-tary policies are associated with more stable inflation and output gap and therefore could hav...|$|R
