5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these <b>maintained</b> <b>the</b> terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this <b>maintained</b> <b>the</b> unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot.

The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subdivision}} of {{the developing}} Drosophila wing into anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments is important for its development. The activities of the selector genes engrailed and invected in posterior cells and the transduction of the Hedgehog signal in anterior cells are required for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary. Based on a previous study, it has been proposed that the signaling molecule Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is also important for this function by signaling from anterior to posterior cells. However, it was not known whether and in which cells Dpp signal transduction was required for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary. Here, we have investigated {{the role of the}} Dpp signal transduction pathway and the epistatic relationship of Dpp and Hedgehog signaling in <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary by clonal analysis. We show that a transcriptional response to Dpp involving the T-box protein Optomotor-blind is required to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary. Further, we find that Dpp signal transduction is required in anterior cells, but not in posterior cells, indicating that anterior to posterior signaling by Dpp is not important for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary. Finally, we provide evidence that Dpp signaling acts downstream of or in parallel with Hedgehog signaling to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary. We propose that Dpp signaling is required for anterior cells to interpret the Hedgehog signal in order to specify segregation properties important for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> A/P boundary...|$|R
50|$|The {{overlaps}} in the merged list of x-intervals can be <b>maintained</b> by storing <b>the</b> endpoints of {{the intervals}} in a kinetic sorted list.

The maximum distance between pairs of antipodal can be maintained with a kinetic tournament. Thus, using kinetic convex hull to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower envelopes, a kinetic sorted list on these intervals to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> antipodal pairs, and a kinetic tournament to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> pair of maximum distance apart, the diameter of a moving point set can be maintained.|$|R
