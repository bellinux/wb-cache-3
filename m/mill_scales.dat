40|$|Abstract: The {{relations}} between the milling periods with the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> particle size have been studied. Iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> has been chosen for this research {{due to the nature}} of itself, as a by-product. From this research, the average optimum size for the final iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> particle size intended to produce is at 300 µm. Raw iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> received from the industries was in the form of chip with the average size of 10 mm across and 1. 5 mm thickness. Three different samples from three different steel mill companies have been used for this study. Rolling ball mill has been used to mill the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> with two different milling periods, which were two hours and six hours. After the milling process, the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> was sieved using sieving machine to a few specified grating sizes. Weight of each sample collected from each grating size was calculated in order to get the percentage of the particle size distribution of the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> after the <b>milling</b> process. Sample collected from Steel Mill 1 (SM 1) and Steel Mill 3 (SM 3) showing finer particle size produced after the milling period of six hours as compared to two hours.

The effect of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> addition on the phase formation of sintered specimens from an industrial sinter blend containing 0 to 15 wt pct <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> was examined, and the mineral phases formed during sintering under various conditions (T = 1523 K to 1598 K [1250 °C to 1325 °C] and gas compositions of pO 2 = 0. 5, 5 and 21 kPa) were quantitatively measured. For samples sintered in air (pO 2 = 21 kPa), there was negligible effect of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> addition on the phases formed. The oxidation of the <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> was complete, and phases such as Silico-Ferrite of Calcium and Aluminum (SFCA), SFCA-I, and hematite dominated. Under lower oxygen partial pressures (pO 2 = 0. 5 or 5 kPa), and throughout the temperature range examined, the <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> was converted to magnetite, with the extent of reaction controlled by the hematite-magnetite conversion kinetics. When sintered in the gas mixture with pO 2 = 5 kPa, an increase in the <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> content from 0 to 15 wt pct resulted in a decrease of hematite and total SFCA phases and a corresponding increase in the amount of magnetite which formed.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the photocatalytic efficiency of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> (waste iron oxide collected from local steel plants) for the degradation of textile dyes. The photodegradation on methylene blue (MB) in natural environment with co-existence of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> and oxalic acid / H 2 O 2 under UV or sunlight were studied. Some effecting factors such as <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> content, oxalate ion, H 2 O 2 and MB concentration were also investigated. Dye decomposition rate was found to increase with an increase in the amount of mill, reached a maximum and then decreased with increasing <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> concentration.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> is generated from steel making plants annually. Although some industries use it as raw material, since it contains iron {{in the form of}} FeO, Fe 2 O 3, and Fe 3 O 4, it can be considered as a valuable metallurgical raw material in iron and steel making industry as well.

Accordingly, different portions of <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> were charged into an electric arc furnace (with two different charging methods) and the results were compared with reference heats.

Hexavalent chromium is a pollutant which could be adsorbed to <b>mill</b> <b>scale.</b> Different pre-treatment of the <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> was tested to optimize the adsorption of hexavalent chromium. For an efficient adsorption of hexavalent chromium the pH had to be below 6 in the aqueous phase.

A large heterogeneity of the material was noticed during the adsorption tests and the capacity fluctuated significantly between 50 % and 85 % for the different samples.

40|$|Abstract. In this project, iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> {{has been}} used to produce iron powder that can be used within the Powder Metallurgy process. To achieve this objective, the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> needs to be refined. This involve the work of {{grinding}} the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> to an effective particle size, which is 300 µm. Latter, the grounded iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> will undergo the magnetic separation process. The purpose of this process is to remove any non-magnetic material. Than the following process is to fully oxidize and reduce the iron <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> to form pure iron powder. From this step an optimum value for maximum heating temperature, heating rate and heating cycle was determined. Than in order to determine whether the oxidation and the reduction process have completely achieved their objective, the iron oxide and the iron powder that have been produced from both process, was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD) and X-Ray Florescent Analysis (XRF) technique. From the oxidation process, it is obvious that sample C gave higher oxidation percentage, which is 11. 22 %.
