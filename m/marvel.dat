5|$|<b>Marvel</b> Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter {{was then}} {{released}} in 1997, which replaced {{most of the}} X-Men cast with other heroes from the <b>Marvel</b> Universe and introduced the character assist mechanic. <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes later followed in 1998, exchanging {{the majority of the}} Street Fighter cast with characters from other Capcom video games series, such as Mega Man and Darkstalkers. In 1999, Capcom announced the development of yet another sequel, called <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes. <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 2 heavily re-used assets from previous Capcom-developed games, including Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalkers, and the earlier <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom titles, resulting in a large roster of 56 playable characters. Shortly after the release of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox ports for <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 2, Capcom lost the use of the <b>Marvel</b> license, putting the series on an indefinite hiatus. However, with the resurgence of the fighting game genre in 2008, owing to the success of Street Fighter IV, <b>Marvel</b> requested Capcom to collaborate with them once again. Capcom would announce the development of the next installment in the <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom series, <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, in 2010. The game was eventually released in 2011. An updated version of <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3, titled Ultimate <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3, was released later in the same year. The high-definition compilation game <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom Origins was then released in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Avi Arad, the CEO of <b>Marvel</b> Studios, first {{announced}} plans to develop the film in April 2005, after <b>Marvel</b> Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. <b>Marvel</b> discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), was hired by <b>Marvel</b> Studios to write the film in June 2007. In {{the wake of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, <b>Marvel</b> negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, <b>Marvel</b> Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future <b>Marvel</b> films.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, <b>Marvel</b> Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, <b>Marvel</b> had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. <b>Marvel</b> made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios {{and wanted to}} get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form <b>Marvel</b> Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and <b>Marvel.</b> According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, <b>Marvel</b> presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. <b>Marvel</b> characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Iron Man 2, a {{conflict}} between Paramount Pictures, which had distribution rights to certain <b>Marvel</b> properties, and The Walt Disney Company, <b>Marvel</b> Entertainment's new corporate parent, clouded the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film. On October 18, 2010, The Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3, with Disney, <b>Marvel,</b> and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013 release date for the film.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Ultimate <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which {{acquired}} <b>Marvel</b> in 2009, chose not to renew Capcom's license with the <b>Marvel</b> characters, instead opting {{to put them in}} its own self-published Disney Infinity series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both Ultimate <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 3 and <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom 2 off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision to cancel the Disney Infinity series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them to license their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. <b>Marvel</b> vs. Capcom: Infinite was revealed in December 2016, and then released in September 2017.|$|E

In May 2000, <b>Marvel</b> teamed with Artisan Entertainment to help finance the film. However, a lawsuit arose between <b>Marvel</b> Comics and Joe Simon over the ownership of Captain America copyrights, disrupting the development process of the film.

In 2005, <b>Marvel</b> received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America.

5|$|In May 2013, The Hollywood Reporter {{reported}} that <b>Marvel</b> had a working script for Ms. <b>Marvel.</b> In October 2014, <b>Marvel</b> announced the film would be titled Captain <b>Marvel</b> and feature Carol Danvers.

5|$|In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company {{purchased}} <b>Marvel</b> Entertainment for $4 billion.

Disney has distributed all subsequent <b>Marvel</b> Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk {{was not part of the}} deal, due to an agreement between <b>Marvel</b> and Universal, where <b>Marvel</b> owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why <b>Marvel</b> has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several <b>Marvel</b> characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks.|$|E
