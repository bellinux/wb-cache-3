5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (<b>Max-Planck-Institute</b> for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E

Among them are state-of-the-art detectors for X-ray imaging and spectroscopy. Their common features are the integration of the readout electronics on the detector chip and a fully depleted bulk with a non-structured thin entrance window, guaranteeing excellent energy resolution and high quantum efficiency over a wide energy range. Fully depleted and backside illuminated Charge Coupled Devices (pn-CCDs) have been developed and are operated successfully as focal plane detector of the XMM-Newton satellite. They have a sensitive area of 6 x 6 cm with a pixel size of 150 x 150 µm, an equivalent noise charge of 4 el. rms. operating at 150 K, and an ultra-fast full frame readout time of 4. 5 msec. The integrated detector-preamplifier structure DEPFET (DEpleted P-channel Field Effect Transistor) is the basic element of an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) with random accessible pixels, flexible readout modes, and the potential for repetitive non-destructive readout with subelectron resolution.

40|$|This talk will be {{concerned}} with the questioning strategies shown by speaker of ƢĀkhoe HaiƠƠom, a Khoisan language spoken by a hunter-gatherer community in northern Namibia. My data consists of question answer sequences collected from video recordings of natural conversations. I will discuss the way questions are posed in natural conversation, the interactional functions the questions are used for {{and the manner in}} which the questions are responded to. The main finding concerns ƢĀkhoe question distribution which is markedly different to that of other languages that participated in the <b>Max-Planck-Institute’s</b> Questions Project. Where ƢĀkhoe speakers rely most heavily on content questions, speakers of the other nine languages that participated (American English, Danish, Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lao, Tzeltal and Yélî Dnye) all show a higher use of polar questions. I will argue that the explanation for this difference lies in the interplay of the grammatical form of a question and its interactional function. Speakers of ƢĀkhoe perform different social actions than the speakers of the other languages. I also find that speakers of ƢĀkhoe HaiƠƠom address fewer questions to a specific individual than would be expected from prior research on Indo European languages. Finally I will discuss some possible explanations for both these findings which I propose can be found in the culture of the speakers...|$|R
40|$|ALFA is an {{adaptive}} optics system with laser guide star for the 3. 5 m telescope on Calar Alto, Spain. ALFA {{has been developed}} jointly by the <b>Max-Planck-Institutes</b> for Astronomy (MPIA, Heidelberg) and for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE, Garching). All core components of ALFA were installed at the telescope {{in the course of}} 1996; the system is currently undergoing integration and testing. ALFA uses a continuous-wave dye laser pumped by an argon ion laser to create an articial guide star in the mesospheric sodium layer. The laser is stabilized to the sodium D 2 line at 589 nm with a sodium vapor cell. In normal operation the frequency is locked to the Lamb dip in the absorption cell, but it is also possible to scan the laser under computer control over several GHz for diagnostic purposes. The dye laser has been optimized for stable operation at high power output; 3. 75 W are regularly achieved in single-mode operation. The laser system is located in the coude room of the telescope; the laser beam is transmitted through the coude path to a 50 cm beam expansion telescope attached to the mirror cell of the 3. 5 m telescope. The rst measurements of the sodium spot created with the ALFA laser were made in 1996 with the guide camera of the 3. 5 m telescope and with a 1. 23 m telescope located 276 m away...|$|R

40|$|For {{two reasons}} it is {{important}} to study the sensitivity of the global climate to changes in the vegetation cover over land. First, in the real world, changes in the vegetation cover may have regional and global implications. Second, in numerical simulations the sensitivity of the simulated climate may depend on the specific parameterization schemes employed in the model and on the model's large-scale systematic errors. The <b>Max-Planck-Institute's</b> global general circulation model ECHAM 4 has been used to study the sensitivity of the local and global climate during a full annual cycle to deforestation and afforestation in the Mediterranean region. The deforestation represents an extreme desertification scenario for this region. The changes in the afforestation experiment are based on the pattern of the vegetation cover 2000 years before present when the climate in the Mediterranean was more humid. The comparison of the deforestation integration to the control shows a slight cooling at the surface and reduced precipitation during the summer as a result of less evapotranspiration of plants and less evaporation from the assumption of eroded soils. In general the results of the afforestation experiment are opposite to those of the deforestation case. A significant response was found in the vicinity of grid-points where the land surface characteristics were modified. The response in the Sahara in the afforestation experiment is in agreement with the results from another general circulation model study. (orig.)

40|$|The {{study on}} the Palestine System of Criminal Justice {{presents}} a theoretically exciting and politically most relevant case {{study on the}} transition of criminal justice under conditions of military conflicts, social unrest and limited economic resources. The situation in Palestine insofar parallels that of other countries which have gone or are still going through transitional periods characterized by a range of social problems among which insecurity and violence, a weak state, a weak economy and a weak civil society figure prominently. Problems of insecurity, however, are related to mistrust and with that to the obvious need to re-establish trust as a basic social condition. The challenges {{that come with the}} task of building up trust are manifold as complexity of this task and the need for parallel processes of building state institutions, providing {{for the rule of law}} and justice, building a strong market economy and a civil society do not lend themselves to a simple and straight forwarded answer. The attempt to build trust always carries the risk of failure. A basic condition for building trust concerns the accommodation for concerns of security and justice which will be possible only if institutions and procedures are established that convey the credible message of being impartial and effective in delivering security, justice and freedom from the fear of physical violence. Insofar, at the core of the process that has to be initiated lies building and maintaining of administrative and judicial institutions that can provide for security and justice. In many cases this will amount to building up a state and those powers that are essential elements of a state: executive powers, judiciary and legislature. In fact, most of the proposals that have been made with respect to re-building societies after extended periods of violence clearly speak out for re-establishing a state and state institutions. A strong state, although sometimes perceived to be the source of many problems, certainly is required. In many conflict and post conflict areas it is not the strong state but the lack or the weakness of a monopoly of legitimate power (and violence) which is the problem. Only a functioning state will be able to create again "trust among people". Insofar, relevant links are assumed to exist between security, the state and trust. The study on the Palestine system of criminal justice presented by Mr. Abdelbaqi provides for basic information on the existing legal structures and institutions as well as the reforms needed to improve the existing legislation, institutions and practices. The study is part of the <b>Max-Planck-Institutes</b> ongoing research on criminal justice in transitions and will certainly result in substantial theoretical advances...|$|R
