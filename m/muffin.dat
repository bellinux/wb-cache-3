5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English <b>muffin</b> sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muffins</b> in the United States {{are similar}} to cupcakes in size and cooking methods, the main {{difference}} being that cupcakes tend to be sweet desserts using cake batter and which are often topped with sugar frosting. <b>Muffins</b> are available in both savory varieties, such as cornmeal and cheese <b>muffins,</b> or sweet varieties such as blueberry, chocolate chip, lemon or banana flavours. <b>Muffins</b> are often eaten as a breakfast food. Coffee may be served to accompany <b>muffins.</b> Fresh baked <b>muffins</b> are sold by bakeries, donut shops and some fast food restaurants and coffeehouses. Factory baked <b>muffins</b> are sold at grocery stores and convenience stores and they are also served in some coffee shops and cafeterias.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the quality characteristics of <b>muffins</b> with added Pholiota adiposa powder. <b>Muffins</b> were prepared with different amounts of Pholiota adiposa powder (in 0, 2. 5, 5, 10, and 15 % ratios to the flour quantity). For analyzing the quality characteristics during the manufacturing of <b>muffins,</b> the pH, moisture content, dough density, height, specific volume, baking loss, texture, color, antioxidant activity, total polyphenol content, and sensory test results were determined. As the Pholiota adiposa powder content increased, the moisture content of the <b>muffins</b> decreased from 26. 72 to 22. 56 %. The hardness of the <b>muffins</b> was increased with increasing Pholiota adiposa powder content, with the <b>muffins</b> with 15 % Pholiota adiposa powder the hardest among all the samples.

40|$|This study compares {{in vitro}} and {{in vivo models}} of lipid {{digestion}} from almond particles within a complex food matrix (<b>muffins)</b> investigating whether the cell-wall barrier regulates the bioaccessibility of nutrients within this matrix. <b>Muffins</b> containing small (AF) or large (AP) particles of almond were digested in triplicate using an in vitro dynamic gastric model (DGM, 1 h) followed by a static duodenal digestion (8 h). AF <b>muffins</b> had 97. 1 ± 1. 7 % of their lipid digested, whereas AP <b>muffins</b> had 57. 6 ± 1. 1 % digested. In vivo digestion of these <b>muffins</b> by an ileostomy volunteer (0 – 10 h) gave similar results with 96. 5 % and 56. 5 % lipid digested, respectively. The AF <b>muffins</b> produced a higher postprandial triacylglycerol iAUC response (by 61 %) than the AP <b>muffins.</b> Microstructural analysis showed that some lipid remained encapsulated within the plant tissue throughout digestion.
