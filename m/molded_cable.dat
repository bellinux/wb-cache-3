40|$|End moldings for {{high-voltage}} cables {{are described}} wherein the dielectric insulator {{of the cable}} is heated and molded to conform to a desired shape. As a consequence, high quality substantially bubble- free cable connectors suitable for mating to premanufactured fittings are made. Disclosed are a method for making the cable connectors either in the field or in a factory, molds suitable for use with the method, and the <b>molded</b> <b>cable</b> connectors, themselves...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Electrocardiograms {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} signal processing to diagnose abnormal heart function-ing. Many algorithms have been constructed to analyse, measure and compress these signals. These methods are hard to test because real ECG signals are distorted by several types of noise. Embedded technology can be found inside everything from computerized fitness equipment to lifesaving medical monitoring devices. Practitioners rely on these systems to administer proactive care including exercise and fitness programs, as well as point-of-care diagnostics, treatment and record-keeping. At Affinity Medical Technologies, our passion is remarkably simple: to design and manufacture interconnect products and systems of the highest quality. Affinity is recognized for its expertise in over <b>molded</b> <b>Cable</b> Design and Development of Patient Monitoring Cable Assemblies, ECG Cables, Low Noise Lead wires and Custom Engineered Connector solutions. Affinity is continually improving its Engineering Technology, materials expertise and Manufacturing processes to meet the dynamic needs of our customers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{developed}} a new algorithm, which combines the spectral element method with elastic viscous splitting stress method, for viscoelastic fluid in a planar contraction channel. This is an important topic {{at the cutting edge}} of research in computational rheology. The technique has been used in some other important rheological flow problems of academic and industrial interest. It provides a bench-mark solution for these viscoelastic flow problems and is currently used in industrial applications including plastic <b>molding</b> and <b>cable</b> coating...|$|R
50|$|Sosnik-Morris-Early Commercial Block, {{also known}} as Thalhimer's, are two {{historic}} commercial buildings located at Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North Carolina. They were built in 1929, and known as the Morris-Early furniture store building and the Sosnik's clothing store. Both buildings include elements from the popular Art Deco style. The Morris-Early building is a four-story, brick building with terra cotta ornament and <b>cable</b> <b>molding.</b> The Sosnik's building is a three-story, nine bay by ten bay, limestone faced building. The Sosnik's building was extensively renovated in 1949 by Raymond Loewy Associates, when Sosnik's and Thalhimers merged. In 1958, Thalhimer's acquired the Morris-Early store for further expansion.|$|R
50|$|The front {{entry is}} {{trabeated}} with a granite lintel and features a double-leaf, semi-glazed door with carved Gothic tracery and sidelights which opens onto an entry hall. The hall features paneled wainscoting, cased and studded beams carried on consoles with carved scrolls, and a fireplace with a denticulated and modillioned mantelpiece carried on consoles {{carved in the}} shape of lions, all in oak. To the east of the entry hall is the music room, which has molded door and window surrounds and a peach colored marble Neo-Classical fireplace with <b>cable</b> <b>molding,</b> a central carved scallop, and a denticulated mantelpiece carried on consoles. The music room opens onto the dining room to the south. The dining room features cased beams, molded door and window surrounds, paneled doors, and vertical wainscoting, all in pine. The room is lighted by a large triple window in the south elevation. It has a Georgian fireplace of green glazed brick, with a central panel with dentils and modillions. To the west of the dining room is the library, with oak door and window surrounds and a red brick fireplace with a denticulated mantel with a diamond motif. To the rear is the kitchen.|$|R
