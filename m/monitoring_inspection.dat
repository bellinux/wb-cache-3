Failings identified in the emergency inspection report included: “The arrangements for child protection are ineffective ... the risk assessment process is not robust ... boarding staff are not appropriately supervised and managed and they are not appropriately trained that the arrangements for recording and monitoring of required boarding records are poor … For example, the incident log is not appropriately maintained; it does not include a record of the two recent serious incidents”.
