5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, <b>Maruca</b> vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the <b>Maruca.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most cowpeas {{are grown}} on the African continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer <b>Maruca</b> vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
