2500|$|Within the Canadian economy, {{immigrants}} are mostly {{found at the}} highest education levels. In Canada, 38% of male workers with a post-graduate degree are immigrants to the country. 23% of Canadians are foreign born, but 49% of doctorate holders and 40% of those with a master's degree were born outside Canada. A persistent problem for skilled immigrants is the recognition of foreign credentials. While Canada recruits people to come based on their degrees, many newcomers arrive to find employers and professional organizations not recognizing their foreign education. As the percentage of skilled newcomers {{as a share of}} total migrants has increased, so has this problem. From 2001 to 2006 56% of immigrants who arrived in Canada held a university degree, a sharp increase over the 28% who arrived prior to 2001. In other nations immigrants also find difficulties getting their credentials recognized. An international study by the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Integration</b> Policy Index, sponsored by the research division of the British Council and 100 other signatories, assigned its highest score (3 out of 3) to Canada for the [...] "State facilitation of recognition of skills and qualifications" [...] indicator in their 2006 study of 27 European countries and Canada. The sheer number of skilled migrants to Canada does make the problem a more significant one in that country and politicians of all parties have called for change in this area.|$|E

Emerging mobile lifestyles create different patterns of living and working ‘on the move’, which challenge existing social policies.

40|$|Although {{there is}} some {{considerable}} empirical research on the economic assimilation of migrants to the labor markets of the host countries, little or no analysis exists on the social assimilation and <b>integration</b> of <b>migrant</b> workers. This is surprising since the <b>integration</b> of <b>migrants</b> is not only of political importance, but it should strongly interact with their economic behavior. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of migrants' integration, using data for Germany.

The rationale behind the program is quite straightforward. Lists of integration good or ‘best’ practices are not hard to find, however, as a rule, only short descriptions are available, which makes it hard – if not impossible – to get to know the details of a given project, or even harder to examine whether its success is related to a specific social or cultural environment. Moreover, questions may arise whether projects baptized ‘good practices’ by some experts are implemented exactly as it appears in the descriptions, or these portrayals omit the least successful aspects of a project...|$|R

Three issues are addressed in this paper: the question of public discourses and the political agenda on integration in Belgium; the question of the structuring of integration policies in the country; and finally the question of non-state actors and integration policies and practices. Because integration is also a competence of subnational entities of the Belgian federal State, differences appear between integration conception and policies in Flanders (combining multiculturalist and more assimilationist stances) (Jacobs 2004), in the French community (more influenced by the French assimilationist approach), and in Brussels. However, several trends like the focus on language and socio-professional integration seems to be present in both Flemish- and French-speaking communities even if the policies to achieve those objectives are different. Finally, the paper will try to show the diversity of actors involved in integration practices in Belgium and more specifically the importance of local actors (cities, local associations, migrant associations, etc.).

40|$|This book explores how {{research}} and policymaking {{in the field}} of <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> have developed historically and how this interrelationship plays out in the strongly politicised climate of opinions on migration in Europe. It features interdisciplinary theoretical contributions as well as original empirical studies on research-policy dialogues at both the EU and country level. The chapters study not only how the dialogue between {{research and}} policy is structured (such as advisory bodies, research agencies, and ad-hoc committees), but also how these dialogues affect policymaking and the development of <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> research itself as well. The analysis reveals profound changes in the dialogue structures associated with the research-policy nexus in the domain of <b>migrant</b> <b>integration.</b> On the one hand, dialogue structures have become more ad-hoc, often established in response to distinct political events or to specific problems. On the other, politicisation has not thwarted all efforts to develop more institutionalised dialogue structures between producers and users of knowledge. In addition, research has contributed to policymaking in very different ways in various European countries. This edited volume is unique in this effort to reflect on the impact of research-policy dialogues both on the development of <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies as well as on <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> research. It will be of importance to scholars in this field as well as to policymakers and other stakeholders involved in <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policymaking...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Research on {{socio-economic}} {{determinants of}} migrant health inequalities {{has produced a}} large body of evidence. There is lack of evidence on the influence of structural factors on lives of fragile groups, frequently exposed to health inequalities. The role of poor socio-economic status and country level structural factors, such as <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies, in explaining migrant health inequalities is unclear. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the role of migrant socio-economic status and the impact of <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies on health inequalities during the recent economic crisis in Europe. Methods Using the 2012 wave of Eurostat EU-SILC data for a set of 23 European countries, we estimate multilevel mixed-effects ordered logit models for self-assessed poor health (SAH) and self-reported limiting long-standing illnesses (LLS), and multilevel mixed-effects logit models for self-reported chronic illness (SC). We estimate two-level models with individuals nested within countries, allowing for both individual socio-economic determinants of health and country-level characteristics (healthy life years expectancy, proportion of health care expenditure over the GDP, and problems in <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies, derived from the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Integration</b> Policy Index (MIPEX). Results Being a non-European citizen or born outside Europe does not increase the odds of reporting poor health conditions, in accordance with the “healthy migrant effect”. However, the country context in terms of problems in <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies influences negatively all of the three measures of health (self-reported health status, limiting long-standing illnesses, and self-reported chronic illness) in foreign people living in European countries, and partially offsets the “healthy migrant effect”.

40|$|Migration {{and ethnic}} {{minority}} integration remain heavily contested issues in numerous European countries. Over the past decade, researchers and political commentators have observed an apparent retreat from multiculturalist policies {{related to a}} belief that multiculturalism has lost support among the majority public. Recently, however, based on analyses {{of the evolution of}} <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies, it has been demonstrated that multiculturalist policies were largely left in place. To investigate the effect of multiculturalist policies on public opinion, we use a multilevel analysis of three policy indicators (Multiculturalism Policy Index, Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and <b>Migrant</b> <b>Integration</b> Policy Index) and European Social Survey data in 20 European countries. Results show that multiculturalist policies, as measured by Multiculturalism Policy Index and Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and <b>migrant</b> <b>integration</b> policies more generally, as measured by <b>Migrant</b> <b>Integration</b> Policy Index, to some extent are associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments, while they do not affect public attitudes toward political institutions.

Here, we focus on international networks and gender-specific determinants of remittances from the senders' perspective, {{based on data from}} the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) for the years 2001 - 2006. Our findings show, above all, that foreign women remit less money than foreign men. Using information on the social network in the home country we find, first, that the social network abroad explains part of gender differences in remittance behavior. Second, employing gender interaction terms for the social network effects suggests that remittance behavior is affected by traditional gender roles. Third, the <b>migrant's</b> social <b>integration</b> in the destination country matters. Remittance decisions of naturalized migrants do not show the aforementioned gender effect.
