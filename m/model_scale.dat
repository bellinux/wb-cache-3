2500|$|Since former Japanese National Railway {{and other}} major private {{railways}} adopted track gauge of 1067mm(3'6"), major Japanese N scale models adopted 1:150 with 9mm gauge.

A small number of modelers adopted a <b>model</b> <b>scale</b> of 1:120 with using 9mm gauge tracks to represent the narrow gauge railway [...] gauge lines common in Japan.

2500|$|After the First World War {{there were}} several {{attempts}} to introduce a model railway about {{half the size of}} 0 scale that would be more suitable for smaller home layouts and cheaper to manufacture. H0 was created to meet these aims. For this new scale, a track width of 16.5mm was designed to represent prototypical standard gauge track, and a <b>model</b> <b>scale</b> of 1:87 was chosen. By as early as 1922 the firm Bing in Nuremberg, Germany, had been marketing a [...] "tabletop railway" [...] for several years. This came on a raised, quasi-ballasted track with a gauge of 16.5mm, which was described at that time either as 00 or H0. The trains initially had a clockwork drive, but from 1924 were driven electrically. Accessory manufacturers, such as Kibri, marketed buildings in the corresponding scale.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a framework (FAMOS) {{to identify the}} appropriate spatial and temporal scales for nitrogen (N) flow models. FAMOS has been developed for models of N export from large watersheds. With FAMOS, modelers can identify the appropriate <b>scale</b> for <b>model</b> predictions and for independently scalable model parts. FAMOS is based upon four criteria to check the appropriateness of <b>modeling</b> <b>scales.</b> <b>Modeling</b> <b>scales</b> thus have to correspond with (A) data and scenarios, (B) model assumptions, (C) available resources for modeling, and (D) appropriately scaled predictions. We present 12 indicators to test these criteria. A user of FAMOS may use all or a selection of these, to identify the appropriateness of a <b>modeling</b> <b>scale</b> for his purpose. The indicators vary between 0 and 1 {{as a function of}} scale, and are to be quantified and weighted by the user. A successful application of FAMOS is illustrated for a global model of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export from watersheds to coastal waters. Ranges of appropriate scales are determined for model predictions and five independently scalable model parts, which model the (1) surface N balance, (2) point sources, (3) N flow in sediments and small streams, (4) retention in dammed reservoirs, and (5) riverine DIN retention. We conclude that FAMOS can contribute substantially to a well-balanced and comprehensive identification of appropriate <b>modeling</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{towing tank}} is a basin, several metres wide and {{hundreds}} of metres long, equipped with a towing carriage that runs on two rails on either side. The towing carriage can either tow the model or follow the self-propelled model, and is equipped with computers and devices to register or control, respectively, variables such as speed, propeller thrust and torque, rudder angle etc. The towing tank serves for resistance and propulsion tests with towed and self-propelled ship models {{to determine how much}} power the engine will have to provide to achieve the speed laid down in the contract between shipyard and ship owner. The towing tank also serves to determine the maneuvering behaviour in <b>model</b> <b>scale.</b> For this, the self-propelled model is exposed to a series of zig-zag maneuvers at different rudder angle amplitudes. Post-processing of the test data by means of system identification results in a numerical model to simulate any other maneuver like Dieudonné spiral test or turning circles. Additionally, a towing tank can be equipped with a PMM (planar motion mechanism) or a CPMC (computerized planar motion carriage) to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments on ships or submerged objects under the influence of oblique inflow and enforced motions. The towing tank can also be equipped with a wave generator to carry out seakeeping tests, either by simulating natural (irregular) waves or by exposing the model to a wave packet that yields a set of statistics known as response amplitude operators (acronym RAO), that determine the ship's likely real-life sea-going behavior when operating in seas with varying wave amplitudes and frequencies (these parameters being known as sea states). Modern seakeeping test facilities can determine these RAO statistics, with the aid of appropriate computer hardware and software, in a single test.|$|E
