40|$|Coating {{compositions}} {{and methods}} of their use are described herein for the reduction of corrosion in imbedded <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> The coatings are applied as liquids to an external surface of a substrate in which the <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> are imbedded. The coatings are subsequently allowed to dry. The liquid applied coatings provide galvanic protection to the imbedded <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> Continued protection can be maintained with periodic reapplication of the coating compositions, as necessary, to maintain electrical continuity. Because the coatings may be applied using methods similar to standard paints, and because the coatings are applied to external surfaces of the substrates in which the <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> are imbedded, the corresponding corrosion protection may be easily maintained. The coating compositions are particularly useful in the protection of metal-reinforced concrete...|$|R

In the project was developed the technique of determining the acoustic-elastic coefficients for the material profile, using sections of shelves and the neutral line, that corresponding to the stressed and unstressed conditions of the metal. It is proposed the scheme of construction of system of stress-strain condition diagnostics of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures,</b> the analysis and justification of the choice of technical means for its implementation. Here was developed software for processing and analysis of diagnostics results of stress-strain condition of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> It was held the analysis of time passage intervals of the ultrasonic wave on the neutral line of the shaped profiles. It was determined acoustic-elastic relationship coefficients for shaped profiles of <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> for stresses in tension and compression.

25|$|In March 1925, it {{was decided}} to place an order for 15 {{production}} aircraft. By this time, the Virginia design had evolved to incorporate swept-back wings, and the production Victoria IIIs incorporated this change. Another improvement first introduced in the Virginia was the introduction of metal structures instead of the all-wooden airframes of the early aircraft, with an order being placed for a prototype Victoria with a <b>metal</b> <b>structure</b> (serial number J9250) in September 1927, this being delivered in October 1928. The metal airframe proved much more suitable for the hot and humid areas where the Victoria served, with Victoria IV and Vs with metal structures produced by conversion and new production respectively. The final version was the Mark VI, which substituted modern, more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines for the Napier Lions. The Vickers Valentia was a further improved version with a stronger structure, capable of operating at higher weights.|$|E

500|$|Terminator 2 made {{extensive}} use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to vivify the main two Terminators. The use of such technology was the most ambitious since the 1982 and 1984 science fiction films Tron and The Last Starfighter respectively, and would be integral to the critical success of the film. CGI was required particularly for the T-1000, a [...] "mimetic poly-alloy" [...] (liquid <b>metal)</b> <b>structure,</b> since the shapeshifting character can transform into almost anything it touches. Most of the key Terminator effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for computer graphics and Stan Winston for practical effects. Creation of the visual effects cost $5 million and took 35 people, including animators, computer scientists, technicians and artists, ten months to produce, {{for a total of}} 25 man-years. Despite the large amount of time spent, the CGI sequences only total five minutes of running time. Enlisted to produce articulated puppets and prosthetic effects was Stan Winston's studio, who was also responsible for the metal skeleton effects of the T-800. ILM's Visual Effects Supervisor, Dennis Muren, [...] remarked, [...] "We still have not lost the spirit of amazement when we see ... coming up." [...] Such was the role and creation of CGI that the visual-effects team was awarded the 1992 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.|$|E
