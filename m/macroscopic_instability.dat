The work, which is a complement to a previous and analogous investigation by the same authors on porous elastomers, (Michel et. al., 2007), uses the linear comparison, second-order homogenization (S.

40|$|Elastomeric {{composites}} {{are currently}} used in numerous commercial applications and have shown great promise for utilization in new technologies. This raises the practical [...] -as well as theoretical [...] -need {{to understand the}} connection between the underlying microstructure of elastomeric composites and their mechanical and physical properties, and how the latter may be enhanced with changes in the former. In this connection, the principal aim of this thesis is the development of an analytical, nonlinear homogenization framework for determining the overall response of elastomeric composites subjected to finite deformations. The framework accounts for the evolution of the underlying microstructure, which results from the finite changes in geometry induced by the applied loading. This point is essential as the evolution of the microstructure can have a significant geometric softening (or stiffening) effect on the overall response of the material, which, in turn, may lead to the possible development of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The main concept behind the proposed nonlinear homogenization method is the construction of suitable variational principles utilizing the idea of a 2 ̆ 2 linear comparison composite, 2 ̆ 2 which ultimately allow for the conversion of available linear homogenization estimates into analytical estimates for the large-deformation overall response of the nonlinear elastomeric composites.

Though several reasons for variation in the pace of production are easily given, such as exogenous variation in tastes or in production possibilities, it it {{hard to see why}} there should be large variations in those factors that are synchronized across the entire economy.

A multiscale finite element method (FE 2) is combined with the asymptotic numerical method (ANM) to study the elastoplastic instability which may occur in structures at both macroscopic and microscopic scales.

The stress field is then obtained via the total mechanical strain without any history dependence. Large strains are considered, which induce geometrical nonlinearities in both cases. The ANM framework allows obtaining complex response curves involving limit points in loading and displacement to be obtained.

Failure during SPD may result from geometrical <b>macroscopic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and/or microstructural aspects. However, the available failure criteria are either based on geometrical instabilities or microstructural features and do not account for both failure modes. The present study presents a generalized multi-scale stability criterion for SP materials, accounting for both aspects of failure under various loading conditions. A combined model accounting for cavity nucleation and plasticity controlled cavity growth along with a grain growth model and a modified microstructure based constitutive equation for SP materials is incorporated into Hart’s stability analysis to develop the proposed stability criterion for different loading conditions. Effects of initial grain size, initial levels of cavitation, nucleation strain, strain-rate sensitivity, and grain-growth exponent on the optimum forming curves of different S...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} a hypoeutectic Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 1 B alloy in (alpha + beta) phase field is investigated {{in the present study}} with special reference to flow response, kinetics and microstructural evolution. For a comparison, the base alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was also studied under identical conditions. Dynamic recovery of alpha phase occurs at low temperatures while softening due to globularization and/or dynamic recrystallization dominates at high temperatures irrespective of boron addition. Microstructural features for both the alloys display bending and kinking of alpha lamellae for near alpha test temperatures. Unlike Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, no sign of instability formation was observed in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 1 B for any deformation condition except for cavitation around TiB particles, due to deformation incompatibility and strain accumulation at the particle-matrix interface. The absence of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and early initiation of softening mechanisms as a result of boron addition has been attributed to microstructural features (e. g. refined prior beta grain and alpha colony size, absence of grain boundary alpha layer, presence of TiB particles at prior beta boundaries, etc.) of the respective alloys prior to deformation.

40|$|Self-organization of {{dislocation}} structures, {{slip line}} and band patterning, and <b>macroscopic</b> plastic <b>instabilities</b> are typical manifestations, at different scales of observation, of nonlinear cooperative phenomena. This general aspect is discussed {{with emphasis on}} {{the relations between the}} dynamic properties of dislocations, their collective behavior, the local plastic properties of a material and the conditions for the onset of nonuniform plastic flow. Instabilities can be classified into two main categories which are illustrated by two particular examples: Lüders bands (instabilities of the h type) and the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect (instabilities of the S type) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} multi-scale mechanical properties towards the <b>macroscopic</b> mechanical <b>instability</b> in frictional granular media under multiaxial compressive loading. Spatial correlations of shear stress redistribution following nucleating contact sliding events and shear strain localization are investigated. We report growing correlation lengths associated to both shear stress and shear strain fields that diverge simultaneously as approaching {{the transition to a}} dense flow regime. This shows that the transition from quasi static to dense flow regime can be interpreted as a critical phase transition. Our results suggest that no shear band with a characteristic thickness has formed at the onset of instability...|$|R
