40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{production}} and trade trends for <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products</b> in southern Africa, individual countries’ revealed comparative advantages in producing these products, and the expected implications of freer trade in this sector. The analysis employs mainly annual bilateral trade data for the period 1996 - 2004, evaluated using comprehensive descriptive measures and the Revealed Comparative Advantage index. Results indicate that {{at least half of}} the countries in the SADC region are deficit producers of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products,</b> and that only South Africa is a net exporter of all products considered. Substantial cross-hauling is observed, and the bulk of locally produced products are traded regionally, with over 90 % regional bias for half of all positive trade, although specific opportunities for increased regional trade also exist. Tariff protection generally lies below rates observed elsewhere in the world for this sector; however, for half of the region, consistent non-tariff measures also are maintained. Regional competitiveness in production is restricted to a few countries that possess the capacity to produce and export significant quantities; and with the exception of those countries, the region as a whole lacks net comparative advantage in maize and maize flour production by global standards. These results suggest a need for concurrent policy interventions to improve production, regional and international trade. Food security strategies focusing solely on improving regional trade, while beneficial to specific regional producers, are unlikely to produce major food security benefits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to: ° Report on the {{occurrence}} of mycotoxins in grain and grain products in South Africa; ° Compare with other countries; ° Weigh the evidence regarding effects on health of test animals, and human and animal consumers; ° Determine the need for statutory measures to regulate mycotoxins in food; and ° Propose practical measures for controlling mycotoxins in grain and grain products in South Afica. Good mycotoxin data for maize were obtained from the author's surveys. Data on other local grains is lacking. In domestic maize, fumonisins and deoxynivalenol occur regularly, at levels as low or lower than in Argentina and the USA. Other mycotoxins occur rarely, or at very low levels. Deoxynivalenol is likely to occur regularly in domestic wheat. Aflatoxins were virtually absent in domestic maize, but often occur at concerning levels in imported Argentinean and USA maize. The literature show that aflatoxins are acutely and chronically toxic to humans and animals and most countries maintain regulatory Maximum Tolerable Levels (MTLs) for aflatoxins in grain and grain products. Several countries also maintain regulatory MTLs for deoxynivalenol, based on lesser scientific evidence. The mycotoxin that occurs most frequently in South African maize, is the fumonisin B group of analogues, with fumonisin B 1 the most abundant. Fumonisins are produced by Fusarium verticillioides (previously known as Fusarium moniliforme) and occur in maize worldwide. Fumonisins cause leukoencephalomalacia in horses, pulmonary oedema in pigs, liver cancer in rats and liver and kidney damage in other animals. A statistical relationship between the occurrence of F. verticillioides and fumonisins in maize and oesophageal cancer in humans has been demonstrated in Transkei and in China. The 'toxins derived from F. moniliforme' and fumonisin B 1 have been evaluated as Group 2 B carcinogens i. e. possibly carcinogenic to humans, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation. Based on a review of epidemiological and toxicological evidence of the effects of fumonisins on humans and animals, their occurrence in <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products,</b> previously proposed MTLs, and the practical implications of MTLs set for <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products,</b> we propose the following MTLs for total fumonisins in <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products</b> for human consumption: ° 4 µg/g in whole, uncleaned maize; ° 2 µg/g in dry-milled maize products with fat content of > 3. 0 %, dry weight basis (e. g., sifted and unsifted maize meal); and ° 1 µg/g in dry-milled maize products with fat content of < 3. 0 %, dry weight basis (e. g., flaking grits, brewers grits, samp, maize rice, super and special maize meal) These MTLs are too high to address a possible link of fumonisins with neural tube defects in neonates. This potential problem remains to be addressed, possibly by fortification of maize products with folic acid. We propose MTLs for deoxynivalenol of 2 µg/g in cereal grains for food use, and 1 µg/g in cereal grain food products. Finally, we propose that the current regulatory MTLs for aflatoxins be raised from 10 ng/g (total aflatoxins in unprocessed maize) to 20 ng/g. Dissertation (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2004.

40|$|Fumonisin B 1 is a {{mycotoxin}} {{that can}} be produced by certain Fusarium species.

The intake of fumonisin B 1 by {{the population in the}} Netherlands was estimated in an exposure assessment using data on concentrations of fumonisin B 1 in different food products combined with the consumption rate of these products. From the (limited) results summarized here, wheat was found to be the main contributor (73 %) to the total fumonisin B 1 intake. Since the 99 th percentile of the lifelong-average intake (0. 38 ug/kg bw per day as estimated in a worst case scenario) in considerably lower than the tolerable daily intake (2 ug/kg bw per day), the current dietary intake of fumonisin B 1 in the Netherlands is concluded as posing no appreciable health risk...|$|E
40|$|Fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) {{is among}} the most common mycotoxins found in <b>maize</b> kernels <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products</b> worldwide. The {{microbiological}} process of detoxification and transformation of toxic organic pollutants is a promising method for foodstuffs decontamination. Some basidiomycetes, such as the Pleurotus eryngii species complex, include several important commercial edible varieties that can detoxify polycyclic organic compounds and a range of wastes and pollutants. We investigated the potential role of P. eryngii, one of the most consumed mushrooms, in the decontamination of FB 1 in maize. In addition, selected antioxidant enzymes, (soluble peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase), primarily involved in control of cell hydrogen peroxide levels, and lignin degradation, were analyzed, to evaluate their contributions to the molecular mechanisms of FB 1 by P. eryngii. FB 1 decontamination by P. eryngii and involvement of CAT and POD enzymes in the control of toxic decontamination levels of H 2 O 2 were demonstrated. A consistent reduction of FB 1 was observed at different incubation times. The average decrease levels of FB 1, with respect to the control cultures, ranged from 45 to 61 % (RSD < 15 %). This study is a possible eco-friendly approach to reducing this mycotoxin in the feed supply chains. </p...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the fumonisin production potential of 25 isolates of Gibberella fujikuroi species complex isolated from freshly harvested maize produced in Uganda. Twenty three out of the 25 isolates tested were able to produce fumonisins. The total fumonisin production varied between 19. 4 and 99. 8 mg kg - 1. Majority of the isolates were high fumonisin producers. The ability to produce fumonisins varied amongst the isolates tested. Strains identified as Gibberella moniliformis (GU 257904. 1) and Gibberella fujikuroi (EU 979565. 1) were generally higher fumonisin producers (39. 9 - 99. 8 mg kg - 1) compared to those identified as Gibberella moniliformis (FJI 54074. 1) (0 - 24. 9 mg kg - 1). The order of fumonisin production was G. moniliformis > G. fujikuroi > Fusarium proliferatum. Seven strains (MRC 9059, MRC 9063, MRC 9054, MRC 9053, MRC 9067, MRC 9055 and MRC 9066) produced higher amounts of total fumonisins than the reference strain (MRC 826). Some unidentified species (MRC 9061, MRC 9051 and MRC 9064) also produced high fumonisins levels of 87. 9, 84. 3 and 58. 4 mg kg - 1, respectively. The {{findings of this study}} indicated that the G. fujikuroi species associated with maize produced in Uganda are high fumonisin producers.

40|$|Recurrent {{outbreaks}} of Aflatoxin (AF) poisoning in maize continue to exacerbate the food security crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study determined {{the distribution and}} contamination levels of Aspergillus spp. and Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in soil, <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> maize-based <b>products.</b> <b>Maize</b> grain samples (n= 256), semi-processed grain (n= 56), flour (n= 52), hammer mill dust (n= 11), and soil (n= 117) were collected during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. Aspergillus spp. was isolated and AFB 1 was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Aspergillus flavus was frequently isolated in maize samples from the semi-arid regions. The frequency of A. flavus was higher in semi-processed grain than in whole grain and packed flour samples. AFB 1 was not detected in samples from the humid regions. AFB 1 was detected at levels exceeding the Kenyan legal limit of 10 μg/kg in 20 % of the samples, at maximum of 136 μg/kg for semi-processed maize, 77 µg/kg for whole grain and 41 µg/kg for flour sold in open bags. The high temperature and periodic drought prevalent in the semi-arid regions could explain the higher levels of A. flavus and AFB 1 contamination in that climate. In addition, unfavourable drying and storage practices may aggravate the problem. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} the careful monitoring of AF be continued...|$|R
40|$|Fumonisins {{are major}} mycotoxins found {{worldwide}} in <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> Because of their toxicity for {{both human and}} animals, European Union regulations were created to fix the maximal fumonisin B 1 and B 2 content allowed in foods and feeds. Unfortunately, directly measuring these mycotoxins by current analytical techniques is tedious and expensive and most measurement methods do not lend themselves to online control. Alternative approaches to chemical analysis have been developed and involve models that allow the mycotoxin contamination to be predicted based on environmental conditions and analysis by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. In the present work, we use NIR spectroscopy to determine the fumonisin and fungal contents of 117 samples of maize. The determination coefficient between fumonisin and fungal-biomass content was 0. 44. We establish herein a threshold {{for the number of}} CFUs for fungal biomass beyond which the fumonisin content is likely to exceed the European regulatory level of 4000 [*]μg/kg. In addition, we determine the fungal content by using a NIR-spectroscopy model that allows us to sort samples of maize. Upon calibration, the percentage of well-classified samples was 96 %, which compares favorably to the 82 % obtained by independent verification...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium verticillioides (teleomorph Gibberella moniliformis) can {{be either}} an {{endophyte}} of maize, causing no visible disease, or a pathogen-causing disease of ears, stalks, roots and seedlings. At any stage, this fungus can synthesize fumonisins, a family of mycotoxins structurally similar to the sphingolipid sphinganine. Ingestion of fumonisin-contaminated maize {{has been associated with}} a number of animal diseases, including cancer in rodents, and exposure has been correlated with human oesophageal cancer in some regions of the world, and some evidence suggests that fumonisins are a risk factor for neural tube defects. A primary goal of the authors’ laboratory is to eliminate fumonisin contamination of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> Understanding how and why these toxins are made and the F. verticillioides–maize disease process will allow one to develop novel strategies to limit tissue destruction (rot) and fumonisin production. To meet this goal, genomic sequence data, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and microarrays are being used to identify F. verticillioides genes involved in the biosynthesis of toxins and plant pathogenesis. This paper describes the current status of F. verticillioides genomic resources and three approaches being used to mine microarray data from a wild-type strain cultured in liquid fumonisin production medium for 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. Taken together, these approaches demonstrate the power of microarray technology to provide information on different biological processes...|$|E
40|$|Fumonisins are mycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium verticillioides that commonly contaminate <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> The present work shows {{the results of}} a comparative study of three different fermentation's techniques (solid and liquid medium of corn and a solid agarized medium) for the production of fumonisins B- 1, B- 2 and B- 3 with strains of F. verticillioides. The solid medium of corn was the most effective in the production of fumonisins, being Fumonisin B- 1 the one produced with higher concentration, so the extract obtained by solid fermentation process was used for FB 1 purification. Fumonisins characterization and quantification were performed with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. The role of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Fumonisin B 1 mediated toxicology has not been fully addresses in studies exploring FB 1 toxicity. It is evaluated the level of ROS production in kidney cell line (VERO) exposed to 1, 5 and 10 mu M of FB 1 for 0. 5 - 100 min. The ROS level was detected using a fluorescence probe, 2 ', 7 '-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), which could be converted to highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) with the presence of intracellular ROS. Significant increase of ROS products was observed in VERO cells at 10 mu M dose. These results indicate that ROS production by FBI on renal cells is a mechanism of fumonisin mediated toxicity.

40|$|Production and {{processing}} {{of genetically modified}} organisms (GMO) {{in line with the}} European food safety and labelling regulations lead to an elevated risk of unintentional GMO contamination in food producing {{and processing}} companies. For these companies GMO contamination can lead to extensive losses such as decreased product value, recall expenses or decreased brand equity. The question that occurs in many food producing and processing companies is how to manage the risk of GMO contamination most effectively. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show how food companies manage the risk of GMO contamination. Because of the complexity of the German food sector the analysis focuses on one supply chain namely: the production, processing and trading of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> Within this supply chain an assessment of potential losses and safety measures was conducted in a two-step analysis. At first personal interviews with executives or quality managers of companies along the whole supply chain were carried out. Then the results of these interviews were analyzed and used to create the framework for a second session of formalized online interviews within companies of the maize chain. The results of the survey in maize producing, processing and trading, companies show the risk of potential losses that can occur in case of GMO contamination. Additionally the results show the safety measures that can effectively reduce the risk of GMO contamination.

However, save for the cases of acute toxicity, the levels of sub-lethal exposure have not been adequately assessed. It is believed {{that this type of}} exposure does exist even during the seasons when acute toxicity does not occur. This study, therefore, was designed to assess the exposure of households to aflatoxins through consumption of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> Twenty samples each of maize kernels, muthokoi and maize meal were randomly sampled from households in Kibwezi District of Makueni County in Eastern Kenya and analysed for aflatoxin contamination. The samples were quantitatively analysed for aflatoxin contamination using HPLC. The uncertainty and variability in dietary exposure was quantitatively modelled in Ms Excel using Monte Carlo simulation in @Risk software. Aflatoxins were found in 45 % of maize kernels at between 18 and 480 μg kg– 1, 20 % of muthokoi at between 12 and 123 μg kg– 1, and 35 % of maize meal at between 6 and 30 μg kg– 1. The mean dietary exposure to aflatoxin in maize kernels was 292 ± 1567 ng kg− 1 body weight day− 1, while the mean dietary exposure to aflatoxin in maize meal and muthokoi were 59 ± 62 and 27 ± 154 ng kg− 1 body weight day− 1 respectively.

In this study, field trials involving 84 plots were conducted with Bt maize (MON 810) and its isogenic non-Bt counterpart in 2005 and 2006 in South-western France. Mycotoxin levels were determined in grain at harvest. Fumonisins B₁ and B₂, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone were analyzed by LC-MS-MS and the results treated statistically using non parametric tests for mycotoxins and analysis of variance test for weather variables. As the climate was homogenous inside the experimental area, the transgenic event introduced into the maize was the only key parameter which differed between Bt and non-Bt maize plots. Our results showed that all mycotoxin families were not impacted in the same way. The efficacy of Bt maize reduced mycotoxins more than 90 % for fumonisins and more than 50 % for zearalenone although deoxynivalenol was lightly increased. Therefore a competition between the different Fusarium spp. which produced fumonisins or trichothecenes is hypothesized. According to Regulation (EC) No. 1126 / 2007, 93 % of the maize of Bt maize plots were able to be commercialized compared to only 45 % for non-Bt maize plots.

40|$|Fumonisins (FBs) are {{the major}} mycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum, which are found worldwide in <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products.</b> FBs toxic dose and clinical signs of toxicity vary from one species to another. FBs toxicity is commonly linked to their ability on blocking sphingolipids metabolism in all animal species, including avian species. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} ducks exhibit higher sensitivity to FBs toxicity than turkeys, whereas, the accumulation of sphinganine (Sa) in tissues is more pronounced in turkeys than in ducks. The objectives of our works were to investigate the causes which lead to different toxicity between ducks and turkeys to FBs exposure. The following three hypotheses were investigated: i) Toxicokinetics of fumonisin B 2 in ducks and turkeys. ii) Ability of bird cells to protect themselves against high accumulation of free sphingolipids by increasing their catabolism (phosphorylation). iii) Other toxicity mechanisms of FBs rather than their alteration of sphingolipids metabolism (oxidative stress damage and inflammatory responses). The analysis of toxicokinetic parameters of fumonisin B 2 did not provide a significant difference between ducks and turkeys. The measurement of simultaneous toxicity of FBs in ducks and turkeys confirmed higher sensibility of ducks. Also the accumulation of Sphingasine- 1 -Phosphate (Sa 1 P) in the liver correlated with the amount of Sa but not parameters of hepatic toxicity. Moreover, this study revealed that the amount of Sa in the liver was strongly dependent on the amount of FBs. On the other hand, FBs had no effect on oxidative damages parameters in both species. Interestingly, FBs had mild inflammatory response effect in ducks but not in turkeys. Further investigation on the effects of FBs on ceramide metabolism and inflammatory processes would be necessary to understand the different toxicity between ducks and turkeys to FBs exposure...|$|E

Depending on the mycotoxin, mean levels estimated considering tMLs were increased by a factor comprised between 7. 6 and 27 % in maize and maize milling fractions, and up to 99 % in some processed maize-based products, compared to levels estimated considering current ML. Chronic exposure levels estimated across the population groups – representing different age classes and countries – were increased by a factor up to 17 % for fumonisins, 20 % for deoxynivalenol and 83 % for zearalenone. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) for zearalenone set by EFSA at 0. 25 µg/kg body weight (b. w.) per day, and the group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 1 and 2 µg/kg b. w. per day set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) for deoxynivalenol and fumonisins, were used as chronic health based guidance values (HBGV).

40|$|To combat insect {{infestation}} of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products</b> during storage without using chemical fumigants, a possible physical treatment method, microwave technology was investigated. Through its selective heating between cereals and insects, microwave {{technology is a}} possible physical treatment for eradication of insects and their eggs. Eradication of five insect species, namely Sitophilus zeamais, Rhizopertha dominica, Ephestia cautella, Cryptolestes ferrugineus and Tribolium Confusum was studied. Different microwave parameters such as power dosage, microwave mode, length of microwave cavity, maize exposure method and exposure time were investigated. The effective microwave treatment conditions were then selected, and used to treat maize kernels at laboratory scale. The effect of microwave treatment on the physicochemical properties of maize kernels was investigated. Microwave single exposures {{did not result in}} total insect mortality when maize was dropped through the microwave cavity (free falling) as the exposure times were too short. But utilising a pulley system, total insect mortality was achieved in a single exposure of 9 sec. A long microwave cavity (728 mm) resulted in maize kernel damage in terms of swelling, popping and discolouration. Redesigning the cavity by shortening it appeared to reduce these effects. The pulsed microwave mode was found to be better than continuous mode. The selected treatment that eradicated all five insect species with no visible kernel damage was pulsed mode at 2450 MHz frequency, using a 483 mm long microwave cavity, at a power level of 1. 5 kW, with an exposure time of 9 sec. The selected conditions (normal treatment) and a more harsh treatment (2 kW power dosage, 18 sec exposure time) were applied to 4 kg samples of white and yellow maize kernels. The normal microwave treatment significantly decreased the moisture content and kernel weight of maize kernels but had no significant effect on test weight, stress cracks, germination and translucency. The harsh microwave treatment also had significant adverse effects on test weight, translucency, germinability, hardness and stress cracks. Additionally, reduced extractability of certain proteins was observed by 2 D PAGE with the harsh microwave treatment. Both normal (power dosage of 1. 5 kW, for 9 sec exposure time) and harsh (2 kW, 18 sec exposure time) treatment conditions eradicated adult insects and their eggs, but only the former maintains maize quality. The use of microwave technology has potential to be used as an insect control measure of maize products prior to packaging of the products. It is recommended that the effect of pulsed microwave disinfection on nutritional quality (starch and protein digestibility of maize products) be studied. Heat transfer phenomena should be studied and improved if possible to reduce the power usage and possibly shorten the exposure time from 9 sec. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

Other constraints to the use o f sorghum and pearl millet include their image as “second class ” crops, the tannins in sorghum, low cost imported wheat, rice, <b>and</b> <b>maize,</b> <b>and</b> government policies. Breeders must work diligently to develop new cultivars, targeting total units o f useful food or feed per hectare. Improved end-use quality will allow value-added processing, which could improve farm income from identity-preserved grain...|$|R

40|$|A {{limitation}} of small-scale dairy systems in central Mexico is that traditional feeding strategies are less effective when nutrient availability varies through the year. In the present work, a linear programming (LP) model that maximizes income over feed cost was developed, {{and used to}} evaluate two strategies: the traditional one used by the small-scale dairy producers in Michoacan State, based on fresh lucerne, <b>maize</b> grain <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> straw; <b>and</b> an alternative strategy proposed by the LIP model, based on ryegrass hay, <b>maize</b> silage <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> grain. Biological <b>and</b> economic efficiency for both strategies were evaluated. Results obtained with the traditional strategy agree with previously published work. The alternative strategy did not improve upon {{the performance of the}} traditional strategy because of low metabolizable protein content of the maize silage considered by the model. However, the Study recommends improvement of forage quality to increase the efficiency of small-scale dairy systems, rather than looking for concentrate supplementation...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{in eastern}} Africa is {{predominantly}} rainfed <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> {{is a major}} food crop, primarily produced for home consumption and the market by small-scale family farms. The study characterized farm households in the drought prone maize growing areas of eastern Africa synthesizing data from parallel household surveys in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The study provides a comparative analysis of the farm households’ assets, livelihood strategies and crop management practices, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> seed. This illustrates how farmers in a similar agro-ecological environment but with different socio-economic and institutional settings have variously adapted to living with drought and how the inherent weather risk co-determines the livelihood portfolio, agricultural intensification incentives and system development pathways. The study thereby illustrates the challenges for agricultural intensification in such drought prone environments and the scope for drought tolerant <b>maize</b> varieties <b>and</b> explores the research and development implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{elimination}} of consumer food subsidies associated with structural adjustment in Africa {{has been widely}} thought to exacerbate food insecurity for low-income consumers. This article determines how urban <b>maize</b> consumption <b>and</b> expenditure patterns have responded to liberalization of the <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> meal markets in Kenya. The article decomposes changes in maize meal prices attributable to changes in <b>maize</b> grain prices <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> milling margins. Results are obtained through two random household surveys in Nairobi, the first before liberalization and the other afterward. The main finding {{of the study is}} that maize market liberalization has conferred substantial benefits to urban consumers. The combined saving to Nairobi consumers from lower maize milling costs has been roughly US$ 10. 1 million each year, about the same amount that the Government of Kenya allocates annually to agricultural research. Results also indicate that the former consumer subsidies conferred through the official marketing channel were untargeted and actually inversely related to household income. The subsidies on sifted meal also served to entrench a non-competitive market structure that inhibited the development of a lower-cost informal milling system. These findings are consistent with research results from other Eastern and Southern African countries showing that the negative effects o...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} new transgenic crop variety for planting in the European Union (EU) is a decision under irreversibility and uncertainty. We use a real option model to assess the ex-ante incremental benefits and costs of the {{decision to}} release Bt <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> HT <b>maize</b> in the EU- 15 member states. The analysis uses Eurostat data for modelling the benefits <b>and</b> costs of non-transgenic <b>maize</b> using partial equilibrium models. The farm-level benefits <b>and</b> costs of Bt <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> HT <b>maize</b> are derived from field trials conducted within the EU-funded ECOGEN project in combination with secondary data sources. Adoption curves, hurdle rates and Maximum Incremental Social Tolerable Irreversible Costs (MISTICs) are calculated at country level for selected EU- 15 member states. In general, the results show that the MISTICs on a per capita level are very small confirming previous results calculated in values for the year 1995. The MISTICs per farm are much larger. This indicates a problem for decision makers. ...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{strains of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} {{have been reported to}} inhibit fungal growth and may so be potential as biocontrol agents. In this study, 171 LAB strains were isolated from traditional fermented Kenyan milk <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> tested against aflatoxin-producing A. flavus fungi. The three LAB strains showing highest antifungal activity were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. None of the strains were able to completely inhibit fungal growth under conditions favorable for fungi and suboptimal for LAB. These conditions probably reduced the growth and metabolic activity of some LAB isolates, as several growth-related aspects like production of antifungal biomolecules and other metabolites contribute to the inhibiting activity. The results suggest that certain LAB strains could be employed in food to control the growth of aflatoxigenic fungi. Further studies to establish the efficacy of the potential LAB strains in fermented products are in progress. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FinlandPeer Revie...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} the effects of four fertilizer recommendation systems (bianket recommendation, soil test recommendation, recommendation based on nutrient supplementation index and unfertilized control) on five cropping systems (sole cassava, maize, melon, cassava + <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> cassava + <b>maize</b> + melon). The experiment was a split-plot in randomised complete block design, with fertilizer recommendation systems in main plots and cropping systems in subplots. Observations were made on plant growth and yield. Plant samples were also analyzed for N, P and K uptake. Cassava and melon gave higher yields in sole cropping than intercropping while maize yield under intercropping exceeded that under sole cropping by 17 %. Cassava root yield was significantly reduced by 24 and 35 % in cassava + <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> cassava + <b>maize</b> + melon plots.
