5000|$|The Waucantuck Mill Complex was a mill {{complex in}} Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Despite its 2010 demolition, (except for a {{historic}} storage building) {{it is still}} listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original Luke Taft Mill, built in 1824, on the West River {{was very close to}} the present site of the Waucatuck Mill complex. The Waucantuck complex was planned for a condominium and retail complex, underway in 2009. Both are very close to and virtually part of the Wheelockville District, where the Stanley Woolen Mill was built in 1852. Wash and wear fabrics were first developed at this mill in the 20th century. Products were produced under the name of [...] "Indian Head". In the 1960s the former holdings of American Woolen Company were eventually acquired by a company by that name in Uxbridge, MA. Originally the Uxbridge Worsted Company had proposed a buyout of American Woolen to become America's largest woolen conglomerate. The Town of Uxbridge was synonymous with the textile industry and its earliest and later developments. [...] The [...] "Waucantuck Mill Complex" [...] structure was razed in 2010 because of contaminated industrial wastes, and the main complex is gone, {{with the exception of one}} or more storage buildings, though the site remains. A historic marker is planned. The site is the geographic center of the John H. Chaffee Blackstone River Valley National Historic Corridor, a region of national significance to the earliest industrialization of the United States. The Luke Taft Mill, and its successors were important footnotes in the early textile industry of the US. Innovations here included power looms, satinets, <b>mixed</b> <b>textile</b> blends, and wash and wear fabrics.|$|E

The pilot operated for 7. 5 months without PACl (period P- 1, flux: 10 LMH) and then with the addition of polyaluminium chloride (12. 5 mg gMLSS- 1) at 10 LMH for 3 months (period P- 2) and at 12. 5 LMH for other 3 months (period P- 3). The addition of PACl resulted in a significant enhancement of permeate quality. In particular, between P- 1 and P- 2 removal rates related to total phosphorus and textile macro-parameters such as color and anionic surfactants, increased of + 64 %, + 16 % and + 7 %, respectively. No significant effect was observed on COD, non ionic surfactants and nitrogen compounds removal. Apart from color, macro-pollutants data were lower (P- 1 and P- 2) or close (P- 3) to that of full scale Wastewater Treatment Plant, that comprised advanced treatments (high rate clarification and ozone oxidation). Differently, permeate color was similar to that of the filtered WWTP secondary effluent but double the value of the WWTP tertiary treatments effluent...|$|E
40|$|A new {{examination}} of the textile fragments found in the Merovingian burials in the basilica of Saint Denis, near Paris, has recently underscored the diversity of fabrics used to make garments in which {{members of the royal}} court were buried. Among them, some woolens of fine quality had been dyed with indigotin. The most astonishing fibre found belongs to a <b>mixed</b> <b>textile</b> (not skin) with beaver fibers and wool. Silks contained shellfish purple and in one case kermes? Two dyestuffs associated with royalty and privilege. Along with this was large number of gold threads, probably produced locally and that were used in tablet-woven borders or for embroideries. In addition, several figured silks, of oriental origin, testify to the importance of this "foreign" material and the taste for textiles woven with complex techniques and probably what had originally had beautiful designs. Although none of these designs have been preserved and many colors have been greatly damaged, the technical characteristics of the remnants indicate proveniences as far as Byzantium, Sassanid Persia and the Chinese court. Such precious textiles show the high social status and political power of the Merovingian court, a testament to their ability to access such luxurious and costly textiles through diplomacy and/or trade with other powerful empires. The {{examination of}} these rare textiles along with other fine silks and luxury objects from the same period found in France expand our view of the fundamental role of textiles in the political sphere of this early period of European history...|$|E

40|$|Most {{textile waste}} is either incinerated or {{landfilled}} today, yet, the material could instead be recycled through chemical recycling to new high-quality textiles. A first important step is separation since chemical recycling of textiles requires pure streams. The {{focus of this}} paper is on the separation of cotton and PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyester) from <b>mixed</b> <b>textiles,</b> so called polycotton. Polycotton {{is one of the most}} common materials in service textiles used in sheets and towels at hospitals and hotels. A straightforward process using 5 – 15  wt% NaOH in water and temperature in the range between 70 and 90 °C for the hydrolysis of PET was evaluated on the lab-scale. In the process, the PET was degraded to terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Three product streams were generated from the process. First is the cotton; second, the TPA; and, third, the filtrate containing EG and the process chemicals. The end products and the extent of PET degradation were characterized using light microscopy, UV-spectroscopy, and ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, as well as solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the cotton cellulose degradation was evaluated by analyzing the intrinsic viscosity of the cotton cellulose. The findings show that with the addition of a phase transfer catalyst (benzyltributylammonium chloride (BTBAC)), PET hydrolysis in 10 % NaOH solution at 90  °C can be completed within 40  min. Analysis of the degraded PET with NMR spectroscopy showed that no contaminants remained in the recovered TPA, and that the filtrate mainly contained EG and BTBAC (when added). The yield of the cotton cellulose was high, up to 97 %, depending on how long the samples were treated. The findings also showed that the separation can be performed without the phase transfer catalyst; however, this requires longer treatment times, which results in more cellulose degradation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{pattern of}} comparative advantage in {{textiles and clothing}} trade as revealed by export shares of selected developed and developing economies. The estimated revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indices provided strong evidence of comparative advantage enjoyed by the developing economies. However, a few developed high income economies have enjoyed sustainable comparative advantage, especially in textiles trade. Significant negative correlations are observed between country specific income levels and the estimated absolute and relative RCA indices. While most of the developing economies achieved significant improvement of comparative advantage over time in clothing trade, the evidence is <b>mixed</b> for <b>textiles.</b> Additional evidence from Grubel-Lloyd (G-L) index of intra industry trade (IIT) suggest that global textiles trade could be mainly explained {{on the basis of}} product differentiation and economies of scale while clothing trade is more based on comparative advantage.

By 1975, due to export regulations, {{she had left the}} United Kingdom to live and work in the United States. She opened a small {{boutique}} with only one in-house seamstress on East 60th Street, Manhattan, called Hornby of Plenty, in September 1975, which was well-received by buyers who had formerly had to travel to London to see her wholesale collections. Hornby of Plenty swiftly gained a good reputation due to its dedicated customer service and willingness to alter and even make new garments to fit clients at no extra cost, meaning that by December 1975, Hornby had to employ eight additional seamstresses to meet demand. In 1979, Hornby was selling her work to over 40 shops across the United States, and was described as a master of unexpected colour and pattern mixes which looked anything but haphazard. By the 1980s, she was considered a leading designer alongside Zandra Rhodes and Stephen Burrows. Women's Wear Daily reported in 1994 that Hornby had stepped in to take over the Chicago-based Becky Bisoulis brand after Bisoulis fell ill.|$|R

The Swedish”smart” textiles are developed in Borås and are a <b>mix</b> of ordinary <b>textile</b> and new technology.   I analyse the article with a text analysis method, looking at themes and the language’s propositions in focus. Context and the actors in the articles are also important in the analysis. Many women occur as developers of the new smart technical product, a field often knowed as a typical male subject. My theories were then focused on women and technology and the gender aspects. I also use theories about medial enthusiasm, and how media use to discuss and report about new technology. Optimistic visions about the smart textiles are common in the articles, also the local journalists and the local media. The smart textile’s main context is the region itself, and the smart textile is important for Borås local and regional development. Technology is an important asset in region development and smart textile technology in Borås is expected to create new job opportunities making Borås an attraction region to move to.

40|$|WWTP (wastewater {{treatment}} plant) effluents {{are considered}} to be a major source for the release in the aquatic environment of EDCs (Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds), a group of anthropogenic substances able to alter the normal function of the endocrine system. The application of conventional processes (e. g. activated sludge with biological nitrogen removal) does not provide complete elimination of all these micropollutants and, consequently, an advanced treatment should be implemented. This experimental work was conducted on the tertiary ozonation stage of a 140, 000 p. e. activated sludge WWTP, treating a <b>mixed</b> domestic and <b>textile</b> wastewater: an integrated monitoring, including both chemical (nonylphenol, together with the parent compounds mono- and di-ethoxylated, and bisphenol A were chosen as model EDCs) and biological (estrogenic and genotoxic activities) analyses, was carried out. Removal efficiencies of measured EDCs varied from 20 % to 70 %, depending on flow conditions (ozone dosage being 0. 5 gO(3) /gTOC). Biological tests, furthermore, displayed that the oxidation stage did not significantly reduce (only by 20 %) the estrogenicity of the effluent and revealed the presence and/or formation of genotoxic compounds. These results highlight the importance of the application of an integrated (biological + chemical) analytical procedure for a global evaluation of treatment suitability; poor performances recorded in this study have been attributed to the presence of a significant industrial component in the influent wastewater...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{process has}} been {{developed}} for separation of the cellulose, i. e. cotton and viscose, from blended-fibers waste textiles. An environmentally friendly cellulose solvent, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) {{was used in this}} process for separation and pretreatment of the cellulose. This solvent was <b>mixed</b> with blended-fibers <b>textiles</b> at 120 degrees C and atmospheric pressure to dissolve the cellulose and separate it from the undissolved non-cellulosic fibers. Water was then added to the solution in order to precipitate the cellulose, while both water and NMMO were reused after separation by evaporation. The cellulose was then either hydrolyzed by cellulase enzymes followed by fermentation to ethanol, or digested directly to produce biogas. The process was verified by testing 50 / 50 polyester/cotton and 40 / 60 polyester/viscose-blended textiles. The polyesters were purified as fibers after the NMMO treatments, and up to 95 % of the cellulose fibers were regenerated and collected on a filter. A 2 -day enzymatic hydrolysis and 1 -day fermentation of the regenerated cotton and viscose resulted in 48 and 50 g ethanol/g regenerated cellulose, which were 85 % and 89 % of the theoretical yields, respectively. This process also resulted in a significant increase of the biogas production rate. While untreated cotton and viscose fibers were converted to methane by respectively, 0. 02 % and 1. 91 % of their theoretical yields in 3 days of digestion, the identical NMMO-treated fibers resulted into about 30 % of yield at the same period of time...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was thus to evaluate the prevalence of allergic reactions to a <b>mix</b> of <b>textile</b> dyes consisting of 8 disperse dyes: Disperse (D) Blue 35, 106 and 124, D Yellow 3, D Orange 1 and 3, and D Red 1 and 17, in southern Sweden, to assess the clinical association between self-reported skin problems and contact allergy to the mix, p-phenylenediamine and related rubber substances, and to ascertain whether patch testing with the dye mix was equivalent to testing with the separate ingredients at the concentrations used in the mix. Furthermore, the purity of the 8 disperse dyes used for patch testing at various dermatology departments and the significance of impurities in preparations of the dyes with regard to contact allergy were studied. The frequency of contact allergy to the dye mix was 1. 5 %, which is comparable to the values reported in southern Europe. The most common dye allergen was D Orange 1, while the frequency of test reactions to D Blue 106 and D Blue 124 was lower than expected. The mix was found to be as good a detector of contact allergy to the disperse dyes as testing with any combination of the 8 ingredients tested at the concentrations used in the mix. Contact allergy to p-phenylenediamine was a better indicator of self-reported skin reactions to textiles than the <b>textile</b> dye <b>mix</b> used in this study. Thin-layer chromatography visualized impurities in all 107 investigated patch test preparations. No single reference substance could be identified for D Blue 35.

Translating the life cycle of an organism, which is highly adaptive, evolutionary and responsive, this work forms part of my PhD study, “Metamorphoric Fashion”, being undertaken at RMIT University, Melbourne. Using a practice-led research methodology, which draws upon mixed creative methods, my research attempts to engage with the uncovering of imaginative potentials of fashion and textile processes. The concept of transformation leads this investigation, and initially a study of butterfly metamorphosis was undertaken. This involved “fashion-designer-becoming-lepidopterist”, and engaged a movement between the ordinarily disparate worlds of ecology and creative practice. Using mediums of photography and drawing, a series of transitions were recorded in which the organism underwent both transitional and metamorphic change. Through these methods, meditations on relationships between nature-culture become possible, as thinking about ecology enters the creative process. Through drawing, a series of stylizations developed which recorded the imaginative thinking time, line by line. My particular fashion practice {{is in the process of}} transformation and diversification, reflecting the nature of the metamorphic phenomenon, and the particular interpretations of the butterfly study that an individual approach enables. Aiming to uncover the ways in which the practice is able to accommodate these transformations, forms part of this study. Why this might be important for fashion practice more generally perhaps, is because it identifies a type of practice that attempts to evolve itself, to become something it does not yet know.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to answer the {{following}} research questions: How can the new generation of Kuwaiti youth (those aged between 15 and 21) communicate their rich heritage and instinctive awareness of the cultural craft form known as Sadu? To what extent are they aware of this vital craft form? Are young Kuwaiti women interested in wearing textiles that include Sadu? How can one take advantage of Sadu heritage and translate it into proper modern designs for contemporary Kuwaiti women? To answer these questions, the researcher used two research methods: questionnaires and interviews. The questionnaires focussed on 120 young Kuwaiti women aged 15 – 21 from each of the six districts of Kuwait, after which the researcher conducted interviews with twelve young women from the same sample (randomly selected from all six districts) in order to gain deeper and more comprehensive answers to the research questions. Three hypotheses emerged from the results that were presented that will be verified in this discussion, as follows: •	H 1. Young women aged 15 – 21 who are aware of Sadu are more receptive to <b>textiles</b> that are <b>mixed</b> with Sadu than other young women. •	H 2. Some young women will wear <b>textiles</b> <b>mixed</b> with Sadu because this will help them reclaim their cultural heritage and traditions. •	H 3. Some young women who are aware of current contemporary textiles will wear <b>textiles</b> <b>mixed</b> with Sadu because such textiles are part of a new design. Data was collected through two questionnaires; the following results were concluded: •	The sample‟s awareness of Sadu was less than average; •	Their awareness of contemporary textiles and trends was greater than average; •	Their readiness and acceptance of wearing textiles blended with Sadu was less than average. Looking at the correlation between these three topics, it was evident in the first survey that the correlation between awareness of Sadu and readiness and acceptance to wear textiles blended with Sadu was average; the second survey, however, showed that this correlation was weak (almost zero). Conversely, the correlation between awareness of contemporary textiles /trends and readiness to wear textiles blended with Sadu was very weak in the first survey (no correlation was identified between them) and average in the second survey. Based on the above information, the thesis makes a series of detailed recommendations. These include that: 1. The raw materials and natural dyeing used in Sadu should be preserved, its techniques and developed in a scientific and simple manner, and that the heritage of Kuwait should be connected with the ongoing rapid changes elsewhere throughout the world; 2. Educational films on traditional contemporary textiles and accessories should be made and incorporated into a contemporary textiles -design curriculum and developed as a source of innovation, and that Sadu should be incorporated as a subject in different school curricula, thus raising Kuwaiti females‟ awareness of the country‟s environment and heritage; 3. A museum should be established that would preserve traditional Kuwaiti textiles and accessories; 4. Awareness of Sadu in Kuwaiti society should be raised through the gateway of contemporary textiles; field trips should be offered to female students to visit handicraft and heritage sites. 5. Ethnographic museums should be established that will document the country‟s cultural and scientific material; 6. The Kuwaiti government should promote traditional crafts and the work of master weavers through the opening of training institutes and exhibitions; and 7. The media should take on a greater role in highlighting and publicising these crafts. Future research should be conducted into attempts to market Sadu within European contemporary textiles in a manner that conforms to Arabic traditions, implements Arabic and traditional contemporary textiles blended with Sadu, and remedies the limitations that were experienced during this study by avoiding the problem of the sample being influenced by the implemented contemporary textiles. Finally, this study recommends that new techniques should be developed that will provide increased opportunities for experimentation and innovation and the promotion of creative skills and innovative artistic solutions, and that our full attention should be given to cultural embellishments, as these have educational and economic importance for society at both the scientific and practical levels. <br/...|$|R

Identification of bacteria was conducted using Gen III microplate BIOLOG microbial identification system. They were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus ruris, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Kocuria varians. There were 4 different treatments: composting pile without bacteria (T 0), composting pile with inoculation of amylase and protease producing bacteria (T 1), composting with inoculation of lipase and cellulase producing bacteria (T 2), and composting with inoculation all enzyme-producing bacteria (T 3). The result of biodegradation process of T 3 treatment reached the highest temperature (53 ° C) with the longest thermophilic phase compared to other treatments. The lower value of C/N ratio, the more stable the level of maturity of compost. The lowest of C/N ratio value was T 3 (10 %). T 3 treatment compared with other treatments can increase as much as 27 % content of nitrogen, 67 % of phosphorus and 33 % of potassium. All the treatments with bacterial inoculation (T 1, T 2, and T 3) are able to reduce the content of heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Cu) on municipal solid waste biodegradation. It can be concluded that the inoculation of potential enzyme-producing of bacteria on municipal solid waste biodegradation is effective to increase the nutrient content and decrease the heavy metals...|$|R
