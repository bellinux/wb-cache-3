40|$|Lecturepg. 83 Industrial {{agitator}} or mixer configurations {{and associated}} applications present the design engineer {{with a unique}} set of challenges. This was especially true when a major chemical company required an agitator for a large multistaged column. A traditional approach to mixer design, in this case, would attract high vessel and agitator cost {{due to the nature of}} the machine design and the associated mounting/operational loads. This paper reviews the design constraints and problems, along with the solutions developed to provide the end user with equipment that is easily maintainable, and had an attractive capital cost. In particular, it compares the design solutions with the traditional design approaches, and discusses how finite element modeling was used to verify operational limitation due to natural frequency constraints. The paper concentrates on the key component associated with the <b>mixer</b> <b>shaft,</b> and specifically excludes discussion relating to the design and feature requirements relative to gearbox selection...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 This paper {{describes}} the mechanical {{design of a}} mixer {{with the emphasis on}} the fluid forces that are imposed on the impellers by the fluid continuum in the mixing vessel. The analysis shows that the forces are a result of transient fluid flow asymmetries acting on the mixing impeller. These loads are dynamic and are transmitted from the impeller blades to the <b>mixer</b> <b>shaft</b> and gear reducer. A general result for the form of the fluid force equation can be developed. The importance of the mechanical interaction of the mixing process with the mixing vessel and impeller is stressed. This interaction is shown in a number of examples. Fluid force amplification resulting from system dynamics of the mixer and tank configuration are addressed. The role of computational fluid dynamics in mixer process and mechanical design is shown. Several experimental techniques are described to measure the fluid forces and validate mixer mechanical design practice...|$|E

How {{to apply}} a torque is a very {{important}} problem in finite element analysis, and the traditional method utilizes a series of forces instead of the torque, but often leads in stress concentration. In this paper, many methods are being used to achieve the torque. And these methods are being compared, thus we can get several availability methods. Introduction The problem of torque exists in almost every engineering field, such as structural, aerospace and so on. And how to apply torque load accurately is always a matter in finite element analysis. Many structures such as screw tap, polish rod of machine tool, <b>mixer</b> <b>shaft,</b> drive shaft of automobile etc [...] . In order to get precise results of structural subjected to external load, including stress, strain, displacement and other mechanical variables, the modern design method such as finite element method has been employed to solve the problem. According to the engineering experiences, some of traits for instance the keyway of shaft, flat of thread must be considered. So how to apply torque on a section of solid model has become a problem. In general, different methods always lead to the same result. But because of stress concentration and other reasons, different methods lead to different stiff matrixes, even bring about stress singularity; ultimately affect the result’s estimation.

The ends of the trough were shaped to allow the chocolate to be thrown back over the roller {{at the end of each}} stroke, increasing the surface area exposed to air. A modern rotary conche can process 3 to 10 tonnes of chocolate in less than 12 hours. Modern conches have cooled jacketed vessels containing long <b>mixer</b> <b>shafts</b> with radial arms that press the chocolate against vessel sides. A single machine can carry out all the steps of grinding, mixing, and conching required for small batches of chocolate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin <b>shaft</b> <b>mixer.</b> The twin <b>shaft</b> <b>mixer</b> can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|R

To {{participate in this}} promising growth the mechanical seal manufacturers have begun to focus their efforts on creating products that will more adequately {{meet the needs of}} those industries. While the basic mechanical seal has not significantly changed, there are design refinements that assist the biotech and pharmaceutical industries in producing the highest quality product possible. When discussing mechanical seal designs for mixers {{it is important to understand}} that the pharmaceutical and biotech industries have some fundamental application differences. The general differences are summarized in Table 1. It may be surmised from the information in Table 1 that the pharmaceutical industry has as wide a variety of applications as the chemical industry. It is also clear that the biotech industry has comparatively mild operating conditions. Care should be taken to avoid quickly judging that biotech applications are easier to seal. In fact, there are conditions and requirements that make the biotech industry mixer sealing an interesting and challenging chore. The top entry mixer still dominates the mixer marketplace. Top entry drives are used in gold and nickel processing, chemical and petrochemical plants, paper plants, and heavily used in pharmaceutical plants. This paper is limited to sealing slow speed top and bottom entry mixers, that is, <b>mixers</b> with <b>shaft</b> rotational speeds of 350 rpm or less, used in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. In an attempt to avoid confusion, and while there are many similarities between the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, this paper will separate the discussions about these two industries...|$|R
40|$|In {{the food}} {{industry}} we call non-Newtonian food mixtures, those mixtures that have a flow resistance which is changing with change of application speed of shearing force, generating the irregular flow of them. From this point of view, in food industry, we meet: non-Newtonian mixtures with viscosity independent on time (grease, suet, ground meat, the water and powder systems etc); the mixtures with viscosity dependent on time (mashed fruits, the mayonnaise etc); the viscoelastic mixtures (the meat). This paper content the study of correlation between the torsion moment produced by mixing device which is in rotary motion with the value of structural viscosity created into the non-Newtonian mixture, propriety (the structural viscosity) which characterized the degree of homogenization and power consumption needed to result the mixture. The experiments was realized for an mixture with average consistence, S-L type, with solid phase participation (meat) in 50 % proportion and liquid phase participation (water) in 50 % proportion for an constant revolution (n= 120 rot/min) and fill degree of mixing tank by 25 % proportion. The experimental determination was realized by an stall which allow the obtaining of non-Newtonian mixtures in laboratory conditions. This stall was conceptions and realized in Ph.

40|$|Viscous and non-Newtonian fluid {{mechanics}} {{plays an important}} role in a large number of processes in the oil, mineral and chemical industries. In most situations of practical interest, the flow is in the laminar or in the transition regime due to the high viscosity of the products at hand. The use of CFD to tackle such problems is gaining in popularity, a good example of which is in mechanical mixing and reactor design. In CFD applied to mixing, the objectives are to select the best set of vessel configuration, impeller geometry, and operating conditions that provide an “optimal ” performance for the wide range of rheological behaviors that may occur during processing. This presentation focuses on the development of advanced finite element CFD methods and their use for the design of viscous, Newtonian and non-Newtonian mixing processes in stirred tanks. It is illustrated with the performance of two modern mixing technologies namely, the multiple <b>shaft</b> <b>mixer</b> and the single-shaft multipurpose impeller mixer. It is shown that CFD can provide a lot of insight on the {{fluid mechanics}} in the reactor, and give access to mixer design parameters like the power consumption and the mixing time.

40|$|Summary. The article {{describes}} validation {{and development of}} technology of vitamin, mineral and complex premixes {{with the introduction of}} vegetable oil and a set of equipment for its implementation. The two-component mixture was used for research. Crushed wheat was used as the main component, and the metal admixture with magnetic properties, vitamin B 2 and salt of micronutrients MnSO 4 as key components. Quality of the final mixture was determined by the homogeneity test. Trace components dosing accuracy was determined by dosing vitamins B 5, E, A, and trace-element salts MnSO 4, FeSO 4, CuSO 4. Also introduction of vegetable oil in the filler was researched. When the oil was entering the mixer in an amount of 2 % homogeneity of the filler and oil mixture was 94 %. The oil fine spray was provided by special nozzles design. A pilot mixer consisting of a body having a lower portion of the shape of the double trough and lid is developed for conducting research in mixing vitamins, salts of trace elements with the filler. Inside the case, there are two horizontal shafts, rotating in opposite directions. Each shaft has four rows of blades. In {{the upper part of the}} <b>mixer</b> above paddle <b>shafts</b> manifold with injectors is located. The studies found that the accuracy of dosing vitamins B 5, E and A in amounts of 0, 02 and 0, 2 %, does not exceed 1 % of a set weight of component; accuracy of dosing of trace components salts MnSO 4, FeSO 4, CuSO 4 in amounts of 0, 2 % does not exceed 1 % of a set weight of component; high quality of mixing provided by a mixer design that implements the fluidized mixing method...|$|R
