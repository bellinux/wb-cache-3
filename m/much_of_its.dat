It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as scrubland in dryer parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
