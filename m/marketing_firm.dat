40|$|International audienceExisting {{literature}} has investigated the drivers behind {{the expansion of}} emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> into other emerging markets, but we {{are only beginning to}} understand how emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> expand into more advanced markets. Grounding our arguments in institutional theory and the notions of managerial intentionality and path-breaking strategies, we argue that emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> can intentionally pursue path-breaking changes that set them on an organizational path better suited to advanced market conditions, by listing their stock on advanced financial markets or divesting unrelated business. We test our arguments on a sample of 855 emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> from 18 countries over a six-year period. Our results strongly support our argument that emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> can intentionally change their organizational paths and develop the ability to expand into advanced markets...|$|R

In particular, we test to what extent these firms’ location choices are related to agglomeration economies and knowledge externalities because these have been suggested as potential sources for technological catching-up for emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms.</b> Our results indicate that emerging market firms’ location choices differ from the choices of other investors. Emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> place, on average, a higher value on urbanization, diversification economies and sector-specific human resources. However, we find evidence for heterogeneity in the location choices of emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> depending on the home region and the sector of investment. ...|$|R

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a <b>marketing</b> <b>firm</b> to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E

40|$|II Abstract The {{phenomenon}} of emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> acquiring Western firms is an ever-increasing {{one in the}} World economy of today, often stemming from a desire to acquire knowledge, expertise, and technology, in order to spur the global competitiveness. Compared to Western firms however, which focus on synergy realization, emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> seem to apply a somewhat different approach to the imperative post-acquisition phase. Still, the knowledge considering how they differ and how the acquired firm’s strategic core competence is affected by different post-acquisition approaches is scarce. To study how the integration approaches practiced by Western and emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> differ in the post-acquisition phase and how they affect the acquired firm’s strategic core competence, Volvo Car Corporation and its New Product Development department is studied {{through a series of}} 10 interviews, held with senior management at the headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden. Thereafter, the empirical findings are analyzed with extant theories on post-acquisition integration, new theories on emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms,</b> as well as the implications for New Product Development. The main findings suggest that Western firms practice a tight and swift approach to post-acquisition integration, which hampers the acquired firm’s strategic core competence, as the focus of the acquired firm shifts towards realizing synergy effects, rather than leveraging on its strategic core competence. On the other hand, emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> practice a more loose and slow moving approach to post-acquisition integration, which instead spurs the strategic core competence, as the acquired firm is given the opportunity to fully focus on its own strategy and development...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> vary {{to those of}} „standard‟ firms. This is because the cultural framework under which the emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> were created taught them {{how to deal with}} issues such as corruption and bureaucracy encountered in their own countries. A „standard‟ firm does not possess the know-how to deal with these to the same extent and as a consequence, they have to strive further to succeed in emerging markets. On the other hand, the financial resources for a „standard‟ firm are far superior to emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> which means that developed <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> will find it easier from a financial point of view to internationalise into emerging markets than the other way around. The steps for internationalisation that a firm from an emerging market must follow are similar to those that a „standard‟ firm from a developed country must pursue. The individual {{characteristics of}} a firm vary, and this means that issues as method selection are also individual to each firm, but all companies must adhere to some procedures such as market research and investigation of the market. There is a slight variation in the level of knowledge that the firms must have in these areas, as emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> need less knowledge to enter a developed market. Therefore, emerging <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> will not adhere as closely to the logical steps indicated by the Uppsala Internationalisation model. The speed of internationalisation will be higher than that of a „standard‟ firm looking to internationalise into an emerging market. This is because risk is smaller in developed countries which means that emerging viii <b>market</b> <b>firms</b> require less knowledge to enter, and thus, they can penetrate developed markets at a faster pace as they do not feel the need to be as cautious with their investment. The UK market is a viable place for ANALISIS TECNICOS LTD to internationalise its services. It is likely that the investment will not be put under jeopardy by country specific factors such as country risk, and {{the fact that there is}} strong competition in this market only shows that there is demand for the products, and market share to be taken away from competitors. If this is managed correctly, the firm will benefit from high returns and in the future the possibility of entering the European market will be closer at hand...|$|R

40|$|Orientation: Actionable {{reporting}} {{ensures that}} a <b>marketing</b> research <b>firm</b> communicates with clients to achieve business impact {{as opposed to}} merely communicating data to clients. Storytelling communicates with impact as it focuses on creating engagement and inspiring action. Research purpose: This article investigates the use of storytelling {{as a tool for}} actionable reporting by South African <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> Motivation for the study: Clients of <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> often criticise research reports as being too technical and lacking in strategic value. Storytelling is a reporting technique {{that can be used to}} develop actionable research and provide clients with more strategic value. Research design, approach and method: A total of 26 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with client service directors and managers of <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> that deliver quantitative research reports to clients. Main findings: Results indicated that all <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> but one use storytelling. Barriers that impede more regular use are inexperienced research executives and the time intensity associated with creating stories. Practical/managerial implications: Storytelling should be used by <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> to provide clients with more actionable research. Contribution/value-add: The study provides <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> in South Africa with recommendations as to how to implement storytelling as a reporting technique, which will add value to clients and enable <b>marketing</b> research <b>firms</b> to remain competitive and develop relationships with clients.   </span...|$|R
