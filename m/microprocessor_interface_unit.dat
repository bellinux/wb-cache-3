Additionally, the interface permits the host computer to load the microprocessor memory directly with object code, avoiding the use of intermediate data storage such as paper tape. The central computer, containing an assembler language processor for the target microcomputer, can be used from the terminal with all the flexibility offered by the virtual machine facility, producing object code for the micro plus program listings and supporting outputs. The object code can then be loaded directly to the micro and the same terminal device used to run the micro program, communicating with the micro's monitor routine...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Interest in {{personal}} computer networks has grown rapidly in recent years. As {{the personal computer}} {{becomes more and more}} popular, implementing computer networks on those small computers has become an interesting topic. Such networks are usually inexpensive and can be easily installed and maintained. In this thesis work, CLASSLAN, such a network system, is designed and evaluated. The system consists of IBM PC's and <b>microprocessor</b> controlled network <b>interface</b> <b>units.</b> The network is connected via twisted pair wires. The emphasis of this research is in the network's higher layer development. A basic set of educational utilities for CLASSLAN have been developed. They include: - Lecture and conversation - Preparing and administrating examinations - Class monitoring - Questioning during exams - Timer functions - Instant help menu - Completely menu-driven with pop up windows Most aspects related to a network's performance are covered, including user friendliness, layered structure, error control, and error recovery...|$|R

From pages 2 and 3 of IEN 96:The Cable-Bus SystemThe MITRE/Washington Cablenet system {{is based on}} a technology developed at MITRE/Bedford. Similar cable-bus systems are in operation at a number of government sites, e.g. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, but these are all standalone, local-only networks.The system uses standard Community Antenna Television (CATV) coaxial cable and <b>microprocessor</b> based Bus <b>Interface</b> <b>Units</b> (BIUs) to connect subscriber computers and terminals to the cable. ... The cable bus consists of two parallel coaxial cables, one inbound and the other outbound. The inbound cable and outbound cable are connected at one end, the headend, and electrically terminated at their other ends. This architecture takes advantage of the well developed unidirectional CATV components. The topology is dendritic (i.e. branched like a tree)....The BIUs contain Radio Frequency (RF) modems which modulate a carrier signal to transmit digital information using 1 MHz of the available bandwidth in the 24 MHz frequency range. The remainder of the 294 MHz bandwidth can be used to carry other information channels, such as off-the-air TV, FM, closed circuit TV, or a voice telephone system, or, other digital channels. The data rate of our test-bed system is 307.2 kbps.|$|R
