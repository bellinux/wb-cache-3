5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} duck <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> Aylesbury itself was small, and the ducks were {{generally}} sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday, {{and in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by packhorse or cart.|$|E
5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and {{a few members of}} the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E
5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E

5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> a refrigerator.

By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, the New Scientist {{reported}} {{in an article}} that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by Faroese government that the consumption of Pilot Whale <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> the Faroes should stop {{as it had been}} proved to be too toxic. However, the Faroese government did not forbid people to eat Pilot Whale meat due to the contamination, but the advice from the Joensen and Weihe had an effect, it has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality <b>meat.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E

5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> shellfish.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the <b>meat.</b> <b>In</b> addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
