25|$|In igneous petrology, geologists {{attempt to}} learn more about {{volcanic}} systems through the record in igneous rocks. Most magma is generated in the mantle through a process called decompression melting. As <b>material</b> <b>rises</b> and the pressure decreases, solidus declines until part of the mantle can melt.

5000|$|In {{planetary}} science, planetary differentiation is {{the process}} of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behaviour, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the denser materials of a planet sink to the center, while less dense <b>materials</b> <b>rise</b> to the surface, generally in a magma ocean. Such a process tends to create a core and mantle. Sometimes a chemically distinct crust forms on top of the mantle.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of mineral admixtures on mortar brittleness is analysed in this paper. Test {{results show that}} the mortar brittleness increases with the increasing of compressive strength and the passage of age. When the content of binding <b>materials</b> <b>rises,</b> the compressive strength also increases, but the brittleness decreases at the same time. The more the content of fly ash is, the more the brittleness falls. Silica fume added can not only enhance compressive strength but also reduce brittleness of the mortar. MgO added can cut down the brittleness, but can reduce the compressive strength a little at the same time, especially for early compressive strength...|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the Lakshmi Planum and the {{mountain}} belts such as Maxwell Montes is controversial. One theory suggests they formed over a hot plume of <b>material</b> <b>rising</b> from {{the interior of the}} planet, while another says the region is being compressed (pushed together) from all sides, resulting in material descending into the interior of the planet. The broad ridges and valleys making up Maxwell Montes and Fortuna Tessera suggest that the topography resulted from compression. The parallel ridges and valleys were cut by later extensional faults. The extreme height of Maxwell Montes in relation to other compressional mountain ranges around Lakshmi Planum suggests that its origin is more complex.|$|R

50|$|If an {{ordinary}} intake socket is lowered into highly viscous material, the material will flow so slowly, that after short time, the pump will soak up air, because the socket {{is not fully}} covered by the material anymore.

This plate is lowered slowly so that the <b>material</b> <b>rises</b> {{through a hole in the}} center of the plate into the intake socket. The pumped amount and the amount lifted through the plate have to be precisely the same. This must be ensured by appropriate control of the follower plate.|$|R

50|$|Conventional plate-tectonic {{hypotheses}} {{differ in}} detail, {{but since the}} 1980s most have assumed that Earth has operated in a plate-tectonic mode, with plume-based whole-mantle convection driven by an eternally hot core, for at least 3 b.y., and that this convection has kept the mantle stirred and mostly unfractionated. A minority of geoscientists, including Hamilton, contends instead that most components and predictions for such convection have been disproved, and none robustly confirmed. Their alternative explanation involves plate motions driven by top-down cooling and sinking, with mid-plate volcanics such as the Hawaiian Islands reflecting crustal weakness (like a propagating crack) decreasing pressure on asthenosphere already at or close to melting temperatures, rather than plumes of hot <b>material</b> <b>rising</b> from deep in the mantle.|$|R
40|$|Since the Hawaiian Islands {{were all}} created by {{volcanic}} activity, {{it is somewhat}} surprising that only the island of Hawaii now possesses any active volcanoes.
