A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates.

40|$|PDS 365 is a newly {{detected}} rapidly rotating (v sin i = 20 km s − 1) single {{low mass}} giant star which with HD 233517 and HD 219025 forms a remarkable ensemble of single K giants with the unique properties of rapid rotation, very strong Li lines, an asymmetrical Hα profile, {{and a large}} far infrared excess. Their v sin i values are between 18 and 23 km s − 1, and LTE Li abundances, log ε(Li), are between 2. 9 and 3. 9. Detailed analysis of PDS 365 reveals {{it to be a}} ∼ 1 M ⊙ giant with a value of 12 C / 13 C approximately equal to 12. A clear relation between high rotational velocities and very high Li abundances for K giant stars is found only when asymmetrical Hα profiles and large far-infrared excesses are present. If we consider single K giants, we find that among rapid (v sin i ≥ 8 km s − 1) rotators, a very large proportion (∼ 50 %) are Li-rich giants. This proportion is in contrast with a very low proportion (∼ 2 %) of Li-rich stars among the <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common <b>slowly</b> rotating K giants.

It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (Dawn), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain's Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>slowly,</b> often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E

40|$|We use {{computer}} simulation results for a dense Lennard-Jones fluid {{for a range}} of temperatures to test the accuracy of various binary collision approximations for the memory function for density fluctuations in liquids. The approximations tested include the moderate density approximation of the generalized Boltzmann-Enskog memory function (MGBE) of Mazenko and Yip, the binary collision approximation (BCA) and the short time approximation (STA) of Ranganathan and Andersen, and various other approximations derived by us using diagrammatic methods. The tests are of twotypes. The first is a comparison of the correlation functions predicted by each approximate memory function with the simulation results, especially for the self longitudinal current correlation function (SLCC). The second is a direct comparison of each approximate memory function with a memory function numerically extracted from the correlation function data. The MGBE memory function is accurate at short times but decays to zero too slowly and gives a poor description of the correlation function at intermediate times. The BCA is exact at zero time, but it predicts a correlation function that diverges at long times. The STA gives a reasonable description of the SLCC but does not predict the correct temperature dependence of the negative dip in the function that is associated with caging at low temperatures. None of the other binary collision approximations is a systematic improvement upon the STA. The extracted memory functions have a rapidly decaying short time part, much like the STA, and a <b>much</b> smaller, <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> decaying part of the type predicted by mode coupling theory.
