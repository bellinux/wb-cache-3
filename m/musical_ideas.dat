5|$|Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She {{is known}} for experimenting with new <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> and images, and for her unconventionality and provocative work.|$|E
5|$|Daara J {{was formed}} in 1997 and quickly became popular in Senegal from the release of their first {{cassette}} album, Daara J. They followed in 1999 with a more politically themed recording, Xalima, which integrated numerous <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> and instruments from Senegal and other African countries. 2003's Boomerang was critically acclaimed and furthered the combination of various musical and lyrical influences of the previous two recordings. Activism has also been {{an important aspect of}} the group's philosophy since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
50|$|Musical {{material}} is any <b>musical</b> <b>idea,</b> complete or not, independent or not, including motifs.|$|R

5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his <b>musical</b> <b>ideas.</b> Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of <b>musical</b> <b>ideas.</b> The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5000|$|Falling motif: {{both the}} Dwarves' {{falling into the}} trap of the Goblins and them falling after the death of the Goblin King, {{features}} the same <b>musical</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
50|$|Head-motif (German: Kopfmotiv) {{refers to}} an opening <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> {{of a set of}} {{movements}} which serves to unite those movements. It may also be called a motto, and is a frequent device in cyclic masses.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Kurt Sassmannshaus comments: [...] "It's {{very rare}} {{that one person}} {{has the ability to}} {{transform}} a <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> immediately into sound. Most people have to think about the technique. But Li Chuanyun just plays." ...|$|R
5|$|Ocean {{started writing}} songs for Channel Orange in February 2011 with {{songwriter}} and producer Malay, {{his friend and}} creative partner since their start {{in the music industry}} as songwriters. They originally met in Atlanta and worked for the same publishing company, through which they reconnected after Malay moved to Los Angeles. Ocean more spent time with Malay, introducing him to his Odd Future collective, while connecting creatively through their respective songwriting, which led to their partnership for Channel Orange. For the album, Ocean wrote his lyrics to complement Malay's ideas for the music. Occasionally, they wrote songs together by improvising <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> from Malay's keyboard and guitar playing. Channel Orange was written in two weeks, according to the singer.|$|E
5|$|The band's 2009 summer tour {{began on}} July 18 in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Mile High Music Festival. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and {{a show on}} August 22 for the Epicenter Festival in Pomona, California. Their Tool Winter Tour played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at Ozzfest Japan on May 12, 2013. Meanwhile, Tool members have pursued their own musical projects. Keenan has toured {{extensively}} with Puscifer, which he describes as involving a series of <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> {{he did not have}} an opportunity to explore with Tool or A Perfect Circle.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E
5000|$|Gundabad theme: A driving, offbeat {{theme for}} Mount Gundabad and its forces. It is first {{played out in}} [...] "Bred for War", and {{features}} prominently in [...] "Ravenhill". Some identify the underlying Rhythm as a separate <b>musical</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In music composition, {{fragmentation}} [...] {{is the use}} of fragments or the [...] "division of a <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> (gesture, motive, theme, etc.) into segments." [...] It is used in tonal and atonal music, and is {{a common}} method of localized development and closure.|$|R
5000|$|The High Fells: Since the High-Fells were {{originally}} supposed {{to appear in}} An Unexpected Journey, one of the bonus tracks, [...] "Edge of the Wild", has the same <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> that would later be {{used in conjunction with}} them in the following film.|$|R
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

5000|$|In music, a motif [...] or {{motive is}} a short <b>musical</b> <b>idea,</b> a salient {{recurring}} figure, musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a composition: [...] "The motive is the smallest structural unit possessing thematic identity".|$|R
2500|$|... "Gondor Reborn" [...] (Fourth Age theme): A Fourth-Age theme, {{based on}} the Minas Tirith theme. It was also used {{in the fall of}} Barad Dur (and in the finale of the first Hobbit film) as a more general [...] "good triumphs over evil" [...] <b>musical</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
50|$|A motif thematically {{associated}} with a person, place, or idea is called a leitmotif. Occasionally such a motif is a musical cryptogram of the name involved. A head-motif (German: Kopfmotiv) is a <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> {{at the opening of}} a set of movements which serves to unite those movements.|$|R
25|$|The Idan Raichel Project {{released}} its second international release Within My Walls in 2009. Raichel recorded {{much of this}} album {{while he was on}} tour in impromptu settings. During his travels, he met with musicians from around the world and exchanged <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> with them along the way. He recorded and co-wrote songs with Colombian singer Marta Gómez, Cape Verdean Mayra Andrade and Rwandan/Ugandan Somi. The group has performed at a number of international festivals and traveled to and performed across Europe, South and Central America, Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|Beaumarchais's {{business}} deals dragged on, {{and he spent}} much of his time soaking up the atmosphere of Spain, which would become a major influence on his later writings. Although he befriended important figures such as the foreign minister Grimaldi, his attempts to secure the contracts for Duverney eventually came to nothing and he went home in March 1765. Although Beaumarchais returned to France with little profit, he had managed to acquire new experience, <b>musical</b> <b>ideas,</b> and ideas for theatrical characters. Beaumarchais considered turning the affair into a play, but decided to leave it to others—including Goethe, who wrote Clavigo in 1774.|$|E
25|$|Though {{he began}} his musical studies at the Łódź Conservatory, his {{doctoral}} study was in law at the University of Warsaw. Shortly after completing his studies, Tansman moved to Paris, where his <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> were accepted and encouraged by mentors and musical influences Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel, {{as opposed to the}} more conservative musical climate in his native Poland. While in Paris, Tansman associated with a crowd of foreign-born musicians known as the École de Paris; though Honegger and Milhaud tried to persuade him to join Les Six, he declined, stating a need for creative independence. Tansman later wrote a biography of Stravinsky that was extremely well received.|$|E
5000|$|The key <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> of this concerto {{is first}} {{heard in the}} first clarinet, {{accompanied}} {{by no more than}} four other woodwinds: a sequence of two chords—an A major chord with a C on top, then a dominant seventh on F. One note connects the two chords—an A.|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} Mark Corroto notes that [...] "While this session is billed as an improvising occasion, the duo is {{anything}} but loose and no <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> finds a dead end.

40|$|This {{composition}} {{was inspired}} by classroom lesson I gave that focused on using a 'riff' or short <b>musical</b> <b>idea</b> and then harmonizing it several ways to demonstrate that a melody is not constrained to a particular harmony. This piece is dedicated to John Hoffman and the Con Artist band at Griffith conservatory...|$|R
25|$|As a composer, Balakirev {{finished}} {{major works}} {{many years after}} he had started them; he began his First Symphony in 1864 but completed it in 1897. The exception to this was his oriental fantasy Islamey for solo piano, which he composed quickly and remains popular among virtuosos. Often, the <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> normally associated with Rimsky-Korsakov or Borodin originated in Balakirev's compositions, which Balakirev played at informal gatherings of The Five. However, his slow pace in completing works for the public deprived him of credit for his inventiveness, and pieces that would have enjoyed success had they been completed in the 1860s and 1870s made a much smaller impact.|$|E
25|$|Tchaikovsky {{considered}} his next ballet, The Sleeping Beauty, {{one of his}} finest works, according to Brown. The structure of the scenario proved more successful than that of Swan Lake. While the prologue and first two acts contain {{a certain number of}} set dances, they are not designed for gratuitous choreographic decoration but have at least some marginal relevance to the main plot. These dances are also far more striking than their counterparts in Swan Lake, as several of them are character pieces from fairy tales such as Puss in Boots and Little Red Riding Hood, which elicited a far more individualized type of invention from the composer. Likewise, the <b>musical</b> <b>ideas</b> in these sections are more striking, pointed and precise. This characterful musical invention, combined with a structural fluency, a keen feeling for atmosphere and a well-structured plot, makes The Sleeping Beauty perhaps Tchaikovsky's most consistently successful ballet.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, Cheez can be {{understood}} as a concept for realizing a <b>musical</b> <b>idea,</b> as a basis on which the artist (vocalist) explores further on the raga, which is mainly of improvisational character.
