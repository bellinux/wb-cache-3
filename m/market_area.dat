5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125.

40|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{modifications}} of classical central place theory has been proposed, one area that remains unexplored {{is the effect of}} relaxing the nearest centre assumption for the purchase of a specified basket of goods within a given hierarchical level. This article examines the effect of such a relaxation on central place <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> by using higher-order Voronoi diagrams. When used to model <b>market</b> <b>areas,</b> higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be interpreted as overlapping and probabilistic regions. These diagrams construct <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> {{based on the assumption that}} consumers choose from a set of k (k = 1, 2, [...] ., n) nearest centres of the same hierarchical level. If consumers are assumed to be indifferent between the k centres, the appropriate <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> are given by the order-k Voronoi diagram. In this case, it is shown that sales potentials are consistent with those that result when the nearest centre assumption is in effect. If consumers are assumed to have a preference for nearer centres, <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> are defined by the ordered, order-k Voronoi diagram. This situation generates sales potentials which can vary between centres. Central place theory, choice rules, generalised Voronoi diagrams, <b>market</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient.

A third bomb-damaged church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 William Hogarth triptych painted for the high altar of St Mary Redcliffe. The museum also has statues of King Edward I (moved from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch) and King Edward III (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (builder of Bristol Castle) and Geoffrey de Montbray (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.|$|E

5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower <b>Market</b> <b>area</b> and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E
