2500|$|Tarot was reanimated mysteriously before <b>M-Day</b> and implied to {{be alive}} and depowered afterward.

It is {{possible}} that Tarot was not actually depowered by <b>M-Day,</b> nor was she actually [...] "alive" [...] again beforehand. King Bedlam had used his abilities to inexplicably bring her back, and it was unquestionably stated her life was linked to his powers.

2500|$|Wizard {{magazine}} {{published a}} speculative list of supposedly decimated characters, which Marvel Comics dismissed as including {{a number of}} mutants who still have their powers.

Over 198 mutants have already been identified post <b>M-Day</b> with over 30 of said mutants have died since the mutant Decimation hit.|$|E
2500|$|... "Decimation" [...] {{began with}} the self-titled {{one-shot}} Decimation: House of M: The Day After, and heralded the relaunch of the Excalibur team in New Excalibur, focusing on Pete Wisdom looking for Captain Britain to head up a new British super team, {{as well as the}} relaunch of X-Factor from the MadroX miniseries. It also includes several mini-series—Son of M starring a depowered Quicksilver, Generation M focusing on other depowered characters, Sentinel Squad O*N*E showing the latest iteration of the mutant-hunting Sentinels to be robots piloted by humans, , and —and continues throughout the Marvel Universe, particularly in the X-Men-related titles.
