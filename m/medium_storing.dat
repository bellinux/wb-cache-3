50|$|Logical filesystems require {{data and}} {{metadata}} {{to be stored}} on the data storage <b>medium.</b> <b>Storing</b> metadata {{in one place and}} data in another requires lots of slow repositioning activity on most tape systems. As a result, most tape systems use a very trivial filesystem in which files are addressed by number not by filename. Metadata such as file name or modification time is typically not stored at all. Tape labels store such metadata, and they are used for interchanging data between systems. File archiver and backup tools have been created to pack multiple files along with the related metadata into a single 'tape file'. Serpentine tape drives (e.g., QIC) can improve access time by switching to the appropriate track; tape partitions were used for directory information. The Linear Tape File System is a method of storing file metadata on a separate part of the tape. This makes it possible to copy and paste files or directories to a tape as if it were just like another disk, but does not change the fundamental sequential access nature of tape.|$|E

30|$|To protect {{confidentiality}} {{of the data}} deleted from a computing device, the deleted data should be made completely unrecoverable. Conventionally, this is ensured by carefully over-writing the storage <b>medium</b> <b>storing</b> the data using garbage information (Joukov and Zadok 2005; Wei et al. 2011; Garfinkel and Shelat 2003; Sun et al. 2008; Gutmann 1996) or deploying encryption using ephemeral keys (Perlman 2005 a, b, Geambasu et al. 2009, Tang et al. 2012, Reardon et al. 2012, Zarras et al. 2016). This unfortunately was shown to be insufficient, since past existence of the deleted data will create impacts on both the data organization (Bajaj and Sion 2013 b) and the other data which have not been deleted (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a). Those impacts can then be utilized by the adversary as an oracle to derive sensitive information about the deleted data. In the worst case, the adversary is able to completely recover the data being deleted (Chen et al. 2016). Therefore, recent secure deletion approaches focus on eliminating those impacts (Bajaj and Sion 2013 a, b, Chen and Sion 2015; Chen and Sion 2016; Jia et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|US 20110037969 A 1 UPAB: 20110302 NOVELTY - The {{structure}} (400) has a photoactive region (402) integrated on a substrate {{for generating}} charge carriers in responsive to radiation incident on the photoactive region. A reference potential terminal {{acts as a}} charge carrier sink. Four transfer gates (404) {{in the form of}} metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitors transport the charge carriers generated from the photoactive region. One of the transfer gates connects the photoactive region to the reference potential terminal during a time outside drive intervals, such that the transfer gates are driven at every point in time during a cycle. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a system for optical distance measurement (2) a method for optical distance measurement by a pixel structure (3) a tangible computer-readable <b>medium</b> <b>storing</b> a set of instructions to perform a method for optical distance measurement by a pixel structure. USE - Time of flight (ToF) pixel structure for measuring optical distance for ToF three-dimensional imaging. ADVANTAGE - The ambient light can be recorded nearly {{at the same time as}} the signal and subsequently be subtracted from a useful signal, thus increasing the measuring speed. The reset noise is not dependent on the photoactive region, by separating the detection and read-out nodes, thus reducing small selected floating diffusions when using large-area photoactive regions and read-out nodes of small sizes. The pixel structure offers a way of accumulating charge carriers multiple times within the floating diffusion of the pixel structure, by emitting the radiation pulse multiple times, thus minimizing magnitude of the reset noise and increasing dynamic range and signal-to-noise power ratio...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{the changes in}} human density in stores affect the consumers’ perception of crowding and satisfaction. Two experiments were conducted to test how shoppers behave in different levels of store crowding, moderated by the variables: familiarity, acumen towards the store aesthetics, and consumers’ income. The moderation tests indicated that while higher familiarity reduces the negative responses to crowding, higher levels of aesthetic acumen have an opposite effect. The results indicated non-significant differences in consumers’ responses between the low and <b>medium</b> <b>stores</b> human density levels, but showed a substantial increase of negative responses between the medium and high density level. The results indicated non-significant differences between lower and upper income responses. This paper brings not only managerial suggestions, but offers {{a significant contribution to}} a better understanding and integration of conceptual frameworks about the crowding phenomenon, and suggests many avenues for further investigation...|$|R

40|$|A paraffin/water-dispersion is a {{pumpable}} {{latent heat}} storage medium. Latent heat storage <b>mediums</b> <b>store</b> energy by using the heat of crystallization during the phase transition from liquid to solid. Because of that mechanism these materials are also called phase change materials (PCM). To make solid PCMs pumpable they are dispersed in water. The aim of this work is to define the flow characteristics of paraffin/water-dispersions and {{to figure out the}} relationship between the sort of paraffin, paraffin concentration and additive compositions. The measurements for that analysis are done with a rheometer. The measurement results reveal that paraffin/water-dispersions show shear thinning behavior with a strong viscosity drop in a span of low shear rates. With an increasing paraffin and additive concentration the viscosity raises. For describing the flow properties, the mathematical relationship of the Ostwald- de Waele power law is used. The coefficient analysis of the Power-law fluid identifies an aberration during the phase transition. During this aberration viscosity is increasing and the nonlinear properties of the dispersion are enhancing...|$|R

50|$|Millipede storage {{attempts}} to combine features of both. Like a hard drive, millipede stores {{data in a}} substrate or medium and accesses the data by moving the medium under the head as well. However, millipede uses many nanoscopic heads that can read and write in parallel, thereby increasing the throughput. Additionally, millipede's physical <b>medium</b> <b>stores</b> a bit in a small area, leading to high storage densities. Mechanically, millipede uses numerous atomic force probes {{each of which is}} responsible for reading and writing a large number of bits associated with it. Bits are stored as a pit, or the absence of one, in the surface of a thermo-active polymer deposited as a thin film on a carrier known as the sled. Any one probe can only read or write a fairly small area of the sled available to it, a storage field. Normally the sled is moved to position the selected bits under the probe using electromechanical actuators similar to those that position the read/write head in a typical hard drive, although the actual distance moved is tiny. The sled is moved in a scanning pattern to bring the requested bits under the probe, a process known as x/y scan.|$|R
