The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission today {{published a}} final determination made in the arbitration of a dispute over access to the Line Sharing Service. The final determination specifies certain of the terms on which Telstra supplies the LSS to Chime Communications. These are LSS rental charges, and the terms on which wholesale ADSL services are migrated to the LSS. This follows the parties being unable to agree on them, and Chime notifying the dispute for ACCC arbitration. The ACCC has specified a LSS rental charge of 2. 50 per service per month, and has reduced the charges and timeframes to migrate in bulk wholesale ADSL services to the LSS. The specified charges are {{to apply for the}} period from 1 June 2004 until 31 December 2007. The charges result from applying the ACCC 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing pricing principles for the LSS (August 2002) and, in respect of LSS rental charges, the ruling of the Australian Competition Tribunal (June 2006). Telstra proposed in previous regulatory proceedings an LSS rental charge of 9 per service per month, which was opposed by access seekers, and considered not to be reasonable by both the ACCC (December 2005) and the Australian Competition Tribunal (June 2006). Despite these rulings, Telstra continued to require access seekers to pay a 9 per month charge. A key issue in this arbitration was whether a contribution to the costs of the line over which the LSS is supplied {{should be included in the}} LSS rental charges to apply until 31 December 2007. The ACCC decided against doing so. The ACCC has for some time recognised that economic efficiency could be enhanced by the inclusion of an appropriate contribution to line costs in LSS rental charges. However, where line rental charges fully recover line costs, the inclusion of such a contribution in LSS rental charges would lead to an over-recovery of network cost.

30|$|In conclusion, the {{plasmonic}} {{properties of}} multiple nanocylinder pairs are {{investigated by the}} FDTD method. The interaction between the dipolar mode of the nanocylinder results in the lightning-rod plasmon mode in the infrared region. The interaction between the essential plasmon modes was due to a single core-shell nanocylinder pair that resulted in other plasmon modes of multiple nanocylinder pairs. One can systematically control the strength and resonance energy of these plasmon modes by varying the pair-distance between the pairs, the gap-distance between the pair, the optical constant of the dielectric-core, and the surrounding medium. The multiple core-shell nanocylinder pair contains the plasmon mode {{same as that of}} the solid <b>metallic</b> cylinder <b>pairs</b> at the long wavelength part of the spectrum due to metallic screening effect. In particular, one of the lightning plasmon modes in three core-shell cylinder pairs is similar to the cavity mode confined by three solid cylinder pairs. Therefore, the core-shell nanocylinder pairs possess an ideal property that can enhance the electric field intensity at the same spatial positions in the wide wavelength range between the visible and the infrared regions.|$|R

Three materials, aluminum, titanium, and nickel were tested in the WSTF frictional ignition instrument system under atmospheres of oxygen or nitrogen.
