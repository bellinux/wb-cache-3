The main part is focused on applicable legislation of current <b>account</b> <b>contract,</b> its characteristic and to statutes concerning above mentioned questions (for example Act on banks, Act on payment system act). I also mention issuies of contracting parties position, management of banc account, fee for account maintenance, interest on the balance of funds on <b>accounts,</b> termination of <b>contract,</b> <b>account</b> owners death, payments and related deadlines for execution of payment transactions or unilateral changes to terms and conditions. I also consider to be relevant that the czech legislator introduced dual regulation of current <b>account</b> <b>contract</b> {{in connection with the}} implementation of european directive.

40|$|Resume: A {{comparison}} {{of current and}} deposit <b>account</b> <b>contract</b> The original purpose of the diploma thesis " A {{comparison of}} current and deposit account contract" had been to describe and analyse the existing legislation of the Current <b>Account</b> <b>Contract</b> and the Deposit <b>Account</b> <b>Contract</b> regulated by Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code, as amended by subsequent legislation, further to compare them and to draw the appropriate legal conclusions out of this comparison. With respect {{to the development of}} legal control, in particular due to passing the Act No. 284 / 2009 Coll., on payment system, as amended by subsequent legislation, and the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code, it was necessary to modify the meaning of this thesis in the way to reflect new statutory regulation resulting out of the above, while respecting existing regulations. The aim of the thesis thus became a description, analysis and comparison of the Current Account and Deposit <b>Account</b> <b>Contract</b> and a description and analysis of the Contract for Payment Services, all of above covered by the description and subsequent comparison with the <b>Account</b> <b>Contract.</b> The thesis is conceived primarily to comparison of the above-mentioned statutory regulations with {{the fact that some of}} the more significant and at the same time problematic legal issues [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{literature}} that uses the theory of planned behaviour in examining the factors that impact on students' intentions to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting disciplines. A survey of a sample of business students enrolled in an introductory accounting course in a New Zealand University was conducted to gather data about their intended academic majors, and their beliefs and attitudes towards <b>majoring</b> in <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting. The results show that three factors (personal, referents, and control) are determinants of students' intention to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting</b> or other business disciplines. Further analysis revealed that the students' major intentions are influenced by important referents' perceptions. In particular, parents {{appear to have a}} stronger influence on students' intentions to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting.</b> Comparisons of differential personal perceptions by <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting <b>majors</b> revealed that <b>accounting</b> <b>majors</b> hold positive perceptions of some of the qualities of the study of accounting and the accounting profession. Significant differences were also found in the control perception between <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting <b>major</b> students. <b>Accounting</b> <b>major,</b> <b>accounting</b> education, accounting career, accounting profession,...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} fees paid to {{auditors}} during a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change associated with extra audit risk and work. Specifically, we analyse how a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change from local GAAP to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) affects the audit and non-audit fees paid to auditors. Prior research had evidenced that several auditee-specific properties {{are associated with}} audit fees. However, there is lack of specific knowledge on how a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change affects audit and, especially, non-audit fees. Our sample comprises Finnish listed firms that adopted IFRS for the first-time. The Finnish data are employed since prior research findings {{suggest that there are}} large differences between Finnish accounting standards (FAS) and IFRS anticipating extra audit risk and work at the accounting move. Therefore, it is highly likely that extensive supply for audit and non-audit services during the transition from FAS to IFRS would occur. When taking into account several control variables, in line with prior research, our analyses based on unique, hand-collected data provide evidence that a company with a high FAS-IFRS disparity is associated with more costly non-audit services during the transition phase than one with low disparity. Furthermore, the results reveal that audit fees, where audit markets are more competitive, are not significantly related to the magnitude of IFRS adjustments. Overall, the research findings inform, among other things, audit firms and their clients about the type and the level of costs incurred during a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change. ...|$|R

40|$|Conditionals—sentences of {{the form}} ‘If A, B’—are {{ubiquitous}} in human discourse and reasoning, and yet giving a rigorous account of their meaning, or what it takes for true conditionals to be true, has proven difficult. There are three <b>major</b> <b>accounts</b> of conditionals in philosophy of language, representing widespread disagreement. In this dissertation, I explore answers to the following questions {{with respect to a}} class of conditionals called indicative conditionals: What do conditionals mean? Are conditionals the sorts of things that are true or false? If so, what does it take for a true conditional to be true? I present challenges for the <b>major</b> <b>accounts</b> and propose a new account called the Consequence Account. In Chapter One, I draw on linguistics to argue that a popular way of defending the Material Implication Account should be put to rest. In Chapter Two, I present a test for a good account of meaning, called the Relevance Test, and argue that the Material Implication Account fails this test. In Chapter Three, I present a challenge for any account according to which all conditionals with a true antecedent and a true consequent are true, which challenges versions of all three of the <b>major</b> <b>accounts.</b> In Chapter Four, I turn from arguing against the <b>major</b> <b>accounts</b> to arguing for a new kind of account. In this chapter, I defend the claim that conditionals have truth values against popular arguments to the contrary, and I present independent reasons for ascribing truth values to indicative conditionals. Finally, in Chapter Five, I present the Consequence Account, my own truth-valued account according to which an indicative conditional ‘If A, B’ is true just in case there is some relation by virtue of which B is a consequence of A. This account draws on the perception that a conditional expresses a certain kind of strong connection between the antecedent and consequent. In all of this, I hope to establish that the Consequence Account succeeds in areas in which the <b>major</b> <b>accounts</b> face challenges, and that it deserves consideration alongside them as a compelling, intuitive account of indicative conditionals...|$|R
