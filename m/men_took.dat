5|$|A French {{garrison}} of a {{few hundred}} <b>men</b> <b>took</b> over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against the French, Maltese insurgents built Għargħar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The Maltese attacked the fort on a number of occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San Ġwann, but were repelled by the Maltese insurgents.|$|E
5|$|After Palmyra's {{destruction}} in 273, {{it became a}} market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by {{the discovery of a}} large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's <b>men</b> <b>took</b> 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{it was by}} far {{the largest}} battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 <b>men</b> <b>took</b> part in the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. Post, who was a patient at the sanitarium, but Post was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory. In 1892, Post started La Vita Inn, a sanitarium {{of his own and}} brought Beilhart on as an associate. The two <b>men</b> <b>took</b> {{instruction}} in Christian Science. Both Post and Beilhart rejected the doctrine of the religion but they embraced the view that illness was an illusion and could be overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two <b>men</b> <b>took</b> a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

U.S. allied Ho-Chunk, during the night following the battle, scalped another 11 Sauk {{who had been killed}} by the militia, and Dodge had seen Sauk wounded being carried from the battlefield during the fighting. Dodge's forces suffered one dead and 8 wounded, of whom one was injured during the march to Wisconsin Heights, before the battle.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{historians have}} come to believe that Khánh ordered that Nhung be {{liquidated}} and that the earlier reports were deliberately false material disseminated by Khánh through his subordinates. According to this now-established account, one of Khánh's <b>men</b> <b>took</b> Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diệm's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 1382, Richard {{ordered the}} crusade to be {{published}} throughout England. Later that month the bishop and his <b>men</b> <b>took</b> the cross at St. Paul's Cathedral. In February 1383 Parliament, after hesitating in entrusting the mission to a churchman, ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying {{on the war in}} Flanders. The king's only stipulation was that the crusaders should await the arrival of William Beauchamp before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies.|$|E

At dawn, the platoon ambushed a group of North Koreans, killing 13 and capturing three North Koreans. From the body of a North Korean officer the <b>men</b> <b>took</b> a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu.|$|E
5|$|A {{month and}} a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, and {{more than a decade of}} {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few <b>men</b> <b>took</b> a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his <b>men</b> <b>took</b> up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his <b>men</b> <b>took</b> up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of <b>men</b> <b>took</b> advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{operation}} had finished in Cambrai, the first German units had reached the English Channel, but the British counter-attacked just west of Arras on 21 May, following on from the counter-attack of the day before (Battle of Arras). The Totenkopf division suffered casualties of just under 100men in repelling the assault. The Totenkopf was then ordered {{to the town of}} Béthune and crossed the La Bassée river under British attack on 24 May. However, the men were ordered to retreat the next day to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign in Dunkirk and to allow the Luftwaffe to attack Allied positions in the area. The men thus had to make the hazardous crossing again on the night of 26 May. The SS <b>men</b> <b>took</b> Béthune after heavy house-to-house fighting with the British, who withdrew to a line between Locon and Le Paradis.|$|E
