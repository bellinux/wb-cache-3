5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or <b>Multiprotocol</b> Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as <b>Multiprotocol</b> Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

50|$|<b>Multiprotocol</b> Extensions for BGP (MBGP), {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>Multiprotocol</b> BGP or Multicast BGP and defined in IETF , is an extension to (BGP) that allows different types of addresses (known as address families) to be distributed in parallel.
