25|$|To the Egyptians, {{the frog}} {{was a symbol}} of life and fertility, since <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were born after the annual {{flooding}} of the Nile, which brought fertility to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented fertility, named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, or a woman with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog {{on the end of a}} phallus to explicitly indicate her association with fertility. A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown in the form of a frog.|$|E

Having evolved from viruses that {{infected}} other animals, they first appeared in humans in [...] Europe and [...] North Africa thousands of years ago. The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans {{during the time of}} the Spanish Conquests, but the indigenous people had no natural resistance to the viruses and <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> died during epidemics. Influenza pandemics have been recorded since 1580, and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries. The pandemic of 1918–19, in which 40–50 million died in less than a year, was one of the most devastating in history.|$|E

The shape is right, the attitude is right, the proportions are right, but that indescribable something which makes the Lion of Lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world, is wanting.|$|E
