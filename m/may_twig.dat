50|$|Selchenbach {{holds its}} kermis (church consecration festival, locally {{known as the}} Kerwe) on the second weekend in September. At this festival, the village youth {{decorate}} a “bouquet” (actually a tree), hold a “bouquet speech” in which the year’s events are summarized and then dance the Drei Erschde. Formerly, guild balls were held at Shrovetide (Fastnacht), but this has now {{been reduced to a}} children’s masquerade ball. At Easter, children hunt for eggs. Older boys and girls going to Confirmation receive from their godparents three white eggs and three colourful ones. On May Day Eve, a tree is decorated. The custom of young men affixing to their beloved a <b>May</b> <b>twig</b> or a bouquet has over the years been lost. The “witches”, though, have kept on making trouble. The custom of the Pfingstquack, too, is still alive (see the Henschtal for more about this). Over the last few years, the custom of Halloween from North America has been making itself felt. On New Year’s Eve, the New Year is greeted with firecrackers and rockets. Selchenbach has held its village festival since 1984 on the first weekend in August.|$|E

2500|$|Corvids (crows, [...] ravens and [...] rooks) {{are well}} known for their large brains (among birds) and {{subsequent}} tool use. They mainly manufacture probes out of twigs and wood (and sometimes metal wire) to catch or impale larvae. Crows are among the only animals that create their own toys. Tool use in other birds is best exemplified in nest intricacy. Warblers manufacture 'pouches' to make their nests in. Some birds, such as weaver birds build complex nests. Finches and woodpeckers <b>may</b> insert <b>twigs</b> into trees in order to catch or impale larvae. Parrots may use tools to wedge nuts {{so that they may}} crack it open (using a tool) without launching it away.

50|$|The plant {{material}} eaten {{is known as}} browse and is naturally taken straight from the plant, though owners of livestock such as goats and deer <b>may</b> cut <b>twigs</b> or branches for feeding to their stock. In temperate regions, owners take browse before leaf fall, then dry and store it as a winter feed supplement. In time of drought, herdsmen may cut branches from {{beyond the reach of}} their stock, as forage at ground level. In the tropical regions, where population pressure leads owners to resort to this more often, there is a danger of permanent depletion of the supply. Animals in captivity may be fed browse as a replacement for their wild food sources; in the case of pandas, the browse may consist of bunches of banana leaves, bamboo shoots, slender pine, spruce, fir and willow branches, straw and native grasses.|$|R

River currents often tear off branch fragments from certain cottonwood species growing on riverbanks. Fragments reaching suitable environments can root and establish new plants. [...] Some cacti and other plants have jointed stems. When a stem segment, called a pad, falls off, it can root and form a new plant. Leaves of some plants readily root when they fall off, e.g. Sedum and Echeveria.|$|R
60|$|This substance, {{as we have}} {{elsewhere}} remarked, is by {{no means}} unpalatable; it is very nutritious, and forms the chief food of the hundreds of voyageurs who traverse Rupert's Land in boats and canoes during the open season of the year. It must be understood, however, that the compost is not attractive in appearance. It is made in the open air by women who are not very particular in their habits. Hence, during windy weather, a modicum of dust is introduced into it. Even stray leaves and <b>twigs</b> <b>may</b> get into it at times, and it is always seasoned more or less profusely with buffalo hairs. But these are trifles to strong and hungry men.|$|R
50|$|Deposits of sooty mold {{caused by}} the fungus Scorias spongiosa build up below the colonies growing on the copious amounts of {{honeydew}} the insects exude. The aphids do not usually cause much damage to overall tree health, but dieback is occasionally seen on very heavily infested branches. If infestations are heavy, <b>twigs</b> <b>may</b> die, but damage to the tree is usually minor. The aphids can be blasted off with a jet of water or can be controlled with any insecticides labeled for aphids. A wetting agent should be included to help penetrate the waxy body covering of the insect. Horticultural oil sprays and insecticidal soap have also been used successfully. Several parasites are known to attack this aphid and {{it is thought that}} they will in time be effective in reducing the population numbers of aphids.|$|R
50|$|Norway maple, {{red maple}} and sugar maple are the species most {{commonly}} affected. The trouble often starts after insect-induced defoliation, which weakens {{the trees and}} makes them more susceptible to secondary pathogens. Early signs of decline include small or scorched foliage, and premature fall colors on some of a tree's branches. Later, dead <b>twigs</b> <b>may</b> become visible as signs of distress become evident throughout the crown. As the tree's condition deteriorates, whole branches die. The tree may attempt to compensate for its diminishing crown by producing leafy shoots on its trunk. The defoliation may occur early enough that the tree may produce new leaves in summer that do not harden off before the first frost. Fruiting bodies of bracket fungi may appear on the trunk or in the crown. Eventually, the whole tree dies. The process from first signs of trouble to total death may span anywhere from {{a few years to}} several decades.|$|R
50|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Wilsonomyces carpophilus affects {{members of}} the Prunus genera. Almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, prune and cherry trees can be affected. Both edible and ornamental varieties are vulnerable to infection. Shot hole disease produces small (1/10-1/4”) reddish or purplish-brown spots. There may be a light green or yellow ring around these spots. Damaged areas become slightly larger and then dry up and fall away, leaving BB-sized holes in leaves. As the fungus spreads, more leaf tissue is damaged until the leaf falls. Significant infections can {{reduce the amount of}} photosynthesis that can occur, weakening the plant, and decreasing fruit production. The fungi can also affect fruit, beginning as small purple spots that develop into gray to white lesions. Gummosis may occur. These lesions leave toughened spots on the skin, and in some cases the fruit may be lost. Infected buds may appear darker than normal. Branches may develop concentric lesions when infected. These lesions <b>may</b> girdle a <b>twig</b> and kill it.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the diet of the {{mountain}} hare varies from region to region. It seems to be somewhat dependent on the particular habitat that the population under study lives in. For example, in northern Scandinavia where snow may blanket the ground for many months, the hares <b>may</b> graze on <b>twigs</b> and bark. In areas where snowfall is rare, such as Ireland, grass may form the bulk of the diet. Given a choice, mountain hares in Scotland and Ireland seem to prefer feeding on grasses. One study looking at mountain hares on a coastal grassland environment in Ireland found that grasses constituted over 90% of the diet. This was higher than the percentage of grass in the diet of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that inhabited the same environment. The mountain hare is regionally the favourite prey of the golden eagle and may additionally be predated by Eurasian eagle-owls and red foxes. Stoats may prey on young hares.|$|R
25|$|Bonsai are {{carefully}} styled to maintain miniaturization, to suggest age, {{and to meet}} the artist's aesthetic goals. Tree styling also occurs in a larger scale in other practices like topiary and niwaki. In bonsai, however, the artist has close control over every feature of the tree, because it is small and (in its container) easily moved and worked on. The greater scale of full-sized trees means that styling them may be restricted to pruning and shaping the exterior volume once per growing season, never pruning within the canopy nor bending and forming individual branches. In contrast, in a bonsai being prepared for display, each leaf or needle {{may be subject to}} decision regarding pruning or retention, and every branch and <b>twig</b> <b>may</b> be formed and wired into place each year. Given these differences in scope and purpose, bonsai styling uses a number of styling techniques either unique to bonsai or (if used in other forms of plant cultivation) applied in ways particularly suitable to meet the goals of bonsai development.|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} forests, the leaf-litter stratum exhibits one of {{the greatest}} abundances of ant species. This diversity is associated with the variety of available locations for nest building. Ant nests can be found in various microhabitats, including tree trunks and fallen twigs in different stages of decomposition. In this study, we aimed to investigate undecomposed twigs as nest-building resources in the leaf litter of dense ombrophilous forest areas in the southeastern region of Brazil. Demographic data concerning the ant colonies, the physical characteristics of the nests, and the population and structural of the forest were observed. Collections were performed manually over four months in closed canopy locations that did not have trails or flooded areas. A total of 294 nests were collected, and 34 ant species were recorded. Pheidole, Camponotus, and Hypoponera were the richest genera observed; these genera were also among the most populous and exhibited the greatest abundance of nests. We found no association between population size and nest diameter. Only tree cover influenced the nest abundance and species richness. Our data indicate that undecomposed <b>twigs</b> <b>may</b> be part of the life cycle of many species and are important for maintaining ant diversity in the leaf litter...|$|R
40|$|Some {{animals have}} evolved {{the use of}} {{environmental}} materials as “portable armour” against natural enemies. Portable bags that bagworm larvae (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) construct using their own silk and plant parts are generally believed {{to play an important}} role as a physical barrier against natural enemies. However, no experimental studies have tested the importance of bags as portable armour against predators. To clarify the defensive function, I studied the bagworm Eumeta minuscula and a potential predator Calosoma maximoviczi (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Under laboratory conditions, all bagworm larvae were attacked by carabid adults, but successfully defended themselves against the predators’ mandibles using their own bags. The portable bags, which are composed mainly of host plant <b>twigs,</b> <b>may</b> function as a physical barrier against predator mandibles. To test this hypothesis, I removed the twig bags and replaced some with herb leaf bags; all bag-removed larvae were easily caught and predated by carabids, while all bag-replaced larvae could successfully defend themselves against carabid attacks. Therefore, various types of portable bags can protect bagworm larvae from carabid attacks. This is the first study to test the defensive function of bagworm portable bags against invertebrate predators...|$|R
5000|$|As {{in some of}} {{the other}} disciplines, the term {{modularity}} may be used in multiple ways in biology. For example, it may be used to refer to organisms that have an indeterminate structure wherein modules of various complexity (e.g., leaves, <b>twigs)</b> <b>may</b> be assembled without strict limits on their number or placement. Many plants and sessile benthic invertebrates [...] demonstrate this type of modularity (by contrast, many other organisms have a determinate structure that is predefined in embryogenesis). [...] The term has also been used in a broader sense in biology to refer to the reuse of homologous structures across individuals and species. Even within this latter category, there may be differences in how a module is perceived. For instance, evolutionary biologists may focus on the module as a morphological component (subunit) of a whole organism, while developmental biologists may use the term module to refer to some combination of lower-level components (e.g., genes) that are able to act in a unified way to perform a function. In the former, the module is perceived a basic component, while in the latter the emphasis is on the module as a collective.|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of how Jatropha curcas seed yield relates to vegetative plant components under different management regimes is lacking. Such information is necessary to predict yields and design management strategies. This study investigated yield and vegetative plant component interactions, {{and the effects of}} management practices in monoculture, intercropping, and hedge cropping systems in Indonesia. Monoculture and intercropping experiments in Gunungkidul Regency used jatropha IP- 1 M material; hedge experiments in Sumbawa Regency used the Sumbawa provenance. In two-year-old monoculture, pruning significantly decreased yield from 109 kg ha- 1 to 28 kg ha- 1 due to a 40 % decrease in canopy volume and LAI. In four-year-old jatropha intercropping, root barriers reduced yields 80 % by limiting jatropha root access to soil moisture and nutrients in the maize plantings. Intercropping without root barrier and with leaf mulch produced the largest yields of 25 kg ha- 1. In hedge plantings, plant height influenced yield. Single rows of one-year-old monoculture produced 0. 97 g m- 1 at 10 cm spacing, 1. 69 g m- 1 at 30 cm, and 0. 14 g m- 1 for 20 cm of mixed jatropha–gliricidia. Pruning significantly decreased LAI with 20 cm spacing indicating a higher proportion of above-ground biomass allocated for wood growth. Results indicate that seed yield across the three cropping systems can be determined by plant height and numbers of productive twig/branch, although number of inflorescences cluster per productive <b>twig</b> <b>may</b> be more important. Future research should focus on the transition of branches to reproductive phases, and on increasing numbers of productive twigs/branches and inflorescence clusters...|$|R
60|$|The affinities {{of all the}} beings of {{the same}} class have {{sometimes}} been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding <b>twigs</b> <b>may</b> represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, {{in the same manner}} as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.|$|R

40|$|Jatropha curcas L. is a biofuel crop {{that has}} not lived up to {{expectations}} due {{to a combination of}} hype and disappointment and biophysical factors. This PhD thesis is based on the plant production component of the JARAK programme which aimed {{to bridge the gap between}} truth and fiction. This study reviewed the jatropha hype and disappointment and further investigated the hypothesis that jatropha growth and yield are limited by biophysical factors of plant characteristics, cropping systems, and management. My review of the hype and disappointment shows that despite the high expectations fuelled by market pull and technology push, and numerous actors, the commercial potential for jatropha is limited by policy and governance, economics, social, technology, logistical, and environmental. A study of the biophysical components confirms that no current varieties suited to different cropping systems and locations are available. Jatropha aboveground biomass is partitioned predominantly into a structure of stem, branches, and twigs. The below to aboveground biomass ratio was 0. 5 and fruit which was found only on productive twigs accounted for the smallest portion of biomass measured. Seed yields were disappointingly small (109 kg ha- 1) and were largest in monoculture, followed by intercropping and hedgerows in that order, although yields were influenced by age and management of pruning and fertiliser. Seed yield across the three cropping systems can be predicted using plant height and the number of productive twig/branch, although the number of inflorescence clusters per productive <b>twig</b> <b>may</b> be important. Intercropping between jatropha and maize (Zea mays L.) resulted in competition for resources both belowground and aboveground that reduced maize yields. Shoot pruning was effective in managing aboveground competition, while root pruning and root barriers effectively managed competition belowground. Leaf prunings provided a limited, but positive fertility effect on maize yield comparable to 21 kg N ha- 1. Jatropha - maize intercropping has potential for long-term productivity provided management practices such as fertiliser, pruning, and planting density can be developed to minimise competition and enhance complementarity. Based on my review of the jatropha hype and disappointment and my biophysical research results, the planting of jatropha by smallholders, or as a plantation crop cannot be recommended. Once the issues I highlight have been resolved and market confidence restored, jatropha may finally become a commercial source of biodiesel able to provide improved socio-economic and environmental benefits...|$|R
