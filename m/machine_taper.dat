Three American tapers then in use, the Brown & Sharpe(1860), Morse (1862), and Jarno (1889), and the taper series adopted by William Sellers & Co.(1862) were combined into a compromise standard series which contained twenty-two (22) self-holding taper sizes.|$|R

The smaller top item is an insert, the middle shows another three-fluted counterbore insert, assembled in the holder. The shank of this holder is a Morse taper, although there are other <b>machine</b> <b>tapers</b> {{that are used in}} the industry. The lower counterbore is designed to fit into a drill chuck, and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.|$|R
50|$|A drawbar or spindle drawbar is a {{clamping}} mechanism for toolholders on machine tools. The toolholder or <b>machine</b> <b>taper</b> itself {{is held by}} the drawbar and applies force to the spindle, especially when spinning at low speeds.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>machine</b> <b>taper</b> is {{a system}} for {{securing}} cutting tools or toolholders in the spindle of a machine tool or power tool. A male member of conical form (that is, with a [...] ) fits into the female socket, which has a matching taper of equal angle.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>machine</b> <b>taper</b> is a simple, low-cost, highly repeatable, and {{versatile}} tool mounting system. It provides indexability, as tools {{can be quickly}} changed but are precisely located both concentrically and axially by the taper. It also allows high power transmission across the interface, which is needed for milling.|$|E
50|$|All <b>machine</b> <b>tapers</b> are {{sensitive}} to chips, nicks (dents), and dirt. They will not locate accurately, and the self-holding variety will not hold reliably, if such problems interfere with the seating of the male into the female with firm contact over the whole conical surface. Machinists are trained on keeping tapers clean and handling them in ways that prevent them from being nicked by other tools. CNC tool-changing cycles usually include a compressed-air blast while one toolholder is being swapped with the next. The air blast tends to blow away chips that might otherwise end up interfering between the toolholder and spindle.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{pre-compression}} {{that develops}} in a press-fit multi-rim rotor suppresses tensile stresses {{caused by the}} curing process and high speed rotational centrifugal forces, increasing the overall performance of the flywheel rotor. In this study, the interferences and the rim thickness of up to five rims of graphite/Ep and glass/Ep are analyzed to maximize the specific energy density (SED) of a multi-rim composite flywheel rotor. Three states are considered: (a) cured rims with residual stress prior to press-fitting; (b) a stationary press-fitted rotor; (c) a rotor at maximum rotational speed. Two methods of press-fitting rims are presented. One method has each rim <b>machined</b> with <b>tapered</b> inner and outer rim surfaces. The other method uses a guiding rim to expand the outer rim and guide the inner rim into the expanded outer rim. An optimized multi-rim rotor, composed of one glass/Ep rim and one graphite/Ep rim, is scaled to have energy storage capability of 5 kWh, and is successfully manufactured by <b>machining</b> <b>tapered</b> rims and hydraulic pressing.

50|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>tapers</b> can {{be grouped}} into self-holding and self-releasing classes. With self-holding tapers, {{the male and}} female wedge {{together}} and bind to each other {{to the extent that the}} forces of drilling can be resisted without a drawbar, and the tool will stay in the spindle when idle. It is driven out with a wedge when a tool change is needed. Morse and Jacobs tapers are an example of the self-holding variety. With self-releasing tapers, the male will not stick in the female without a drawbar holding it there. However, with good drawbar force, it is very solidly immobile. NMTB/CAT and HSK are examples of the self-releasing variety.|$|R
5000|$|The tooling is {{referred}} to as Quick Change; National Machine Tool Builders' Association, 1927; NMTB; American Standard <b>Machine</b> <b>Taper,</b> ANSI B5.18; DIN 2080 / IS 2340; ISO R 290-2583. [...] There are slight variations in threads and flanges; the European standards (e.g., ISO taper) use metric draw threads.|$|E
50|$|Unlike hand tools, a tool in numerically (digitally) {{controlled}} machines {{is composed}} of several parts, such as the cutting tool (which may be one piece or comprise a body plus indexable inserts), a collet, and a toolholder with a <b>machine</b> <b>taper.</b> Putting the parts together accurately into an assembly is required to achieve error-free production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flexibility}} {{is also used}} to provide accurate axial location. An HSK toolholder has both a tapered shank, and a flange with a mating surface. The shank is short (about half as long as other <b>machine</b> <b>tapers),</b> with a shallow taper (a ratio of 1:10), and slightly too large to allow the flange to seat fully in the socket. The thin walls, short shank and shallow taper provide a large opening {{in the back of the}} tool. An expanding collet fits in there, and mates with 30° chamfer inside the shank. As the drawbar retracts, it expands the collet and pulls the shank back into the socket, compressing the shank until the flange seats against the front of the socket. This provides a stiff, repeatable connection ...|$|R
50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. <b>Machine</b> <b>tapers</b> for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter.

40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} <b>machine,</b> <b>taper</b> portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet chuck holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of collet chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|E
40|$|Many {{years ago}} the very {{unsatisfactory}} bulky and expensive multi-collar thrust-bearing {{was replaced by the}} very compact Michell tilting-pad thrust-bearing, which has given very satisfactory service.

An investigation into stepped thrust-bearings has been carried out with an electrolytic tank, and results indicate that the load capacity is greater than for the tilting-pad bearing. The friction is in-creased but not in the same proportion as the load capacity. By a suitable choice of the operating conditions it is possible to design a stepped-pad thrust-bearing which operates over a wide range of loads with a greater film thickness and a lower coefficient of friction than a tilting-pad thrust-bearing. Owing to the decrease in friction and the simple and cheap construction, there appears no out-standing reason why this new bearing should not supersede the conventional tilting-pad thrust-bearing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. At present, in the cycloid {{rotational}} indexing processing back <b>taper</b> technique, <b>machining</b> requirements {{were achieved}} mainly through {{the method of}} using cycloid cluster to approach the involute, so that the processing efficiency was hindered. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved method that reduces the number of cycloids to enhance the processing efficiency. Firstly, the best approximating cycloid of the involute tooth profile is figured out. Then, the involute is segmented into sections, and the best approximating cycloid on each section is calculated. Each cycloid approaches the involute section to a maximum extent until completing the entire involute approximation. Finally, the simulative processing is carried out. The result demonstrates {{that the number of}} cycloids is one third of the previous and the machining time saves about 64 %.

40|$|In this study, {{an on-line}} {{forecasting}} compensatory control (FCC) strategy is successfully employed {{to improve the}} workpiece accuracy in <b>taper</b> <b>machining</b> by compensating the relative two-dimensional motion errors between the workpiece and the cutting tool. The indirect measurement set-up is developed to determine the motion errors, in both radial and longitudinal directions, of the spindle which positions the workpiece via a master taper. Also, the straightness motion errors of the x-y slide are determined to give the actual tool positions. The reference datum in these measurements, i. e. the master form error and the slide profile, can be determined under on-machine conditions and highly accurate precalibrated references are not required. Based on the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) technique, the two-dimensional motion errors are modelled and their future values forecasted and compensated {{by means of a}} piezoelectric actuator. The adequate model order and parameters are found by performing off-line simulations. The effectiveness of the FCC strategy is also evaluated by comparing the roundness results with and without compensation.

FMMs are used in the red, green, blue (RGB) evaporation process in Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) manufacturing. The taper angle of the hole is adjusted by attaching the objective lens to a micro-vibrator and continuously changing the focal plane position. Eight laser pulses were used to examine how the hole characteristics vary with the first focal plane’s position, where the first pulse is focused at an initial position and the focal planes of subsequent pulses move downward. The results showed that the hole taper angle can be controlled by varying the amplitude of the continuously operating vibrator during femtosecond laser hole <b>machining.</b> The <b>taper</b> angles were changed between 31. 8 ° and 43. 9 ° by adjusting the vibrator amplitude at a frequency of 100 Hz.
