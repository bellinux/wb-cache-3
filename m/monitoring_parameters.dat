50|$|Some digital patient monitors, {{especially}} those used EMS services, often incorporate a defibrillator into the patient monitor itself. These monitor/defibrillators usually have the normal capabilities of an ICU monitor, but have manual (and usually semi-automatic AED)defibrillation capability. This is particular good for EMS services, {{who need a}} compact, easy to use monitor and defibrillator, {{as well as for}} inter- or intrafacility patient transport. Most monitor defibrillators also have transcutaneous pacing capability via large AED like adhesive pads (which often can be used for monitoring, defibrillation and pacing)that are applied to the patient in an anterior-posterior configuration. The monitor defibrillator units often have specialized <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> such as waveform capnography, invasive BP, and in some monitors, Masimo Rainbow SET pulse oximetry.Examples of monitor defibrillators are the Lifepak 12, 15 and 20 made by Physio Control, the Philips Heartstart MRx, and the E, R, and X Series by ZOLL Medical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tooth pitting in gears {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} fault modes in gearboxes, and monitoring the increase of tooth pitting damage can avoid great risk to gearboxes. The optimal selection of <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> in gearboxes can reduce the monitoring cost and improve the reliability on the basis of meeting monitoring requirements. To better track the increase of pitting damage, <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> should include abundant information of pitting growth in its evolution process. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach to select optimal <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> based on fault trend analysis of pitting growth. With the analytical formulations of tooth pitting, the dependencies between damage levels of tooth pitting and the reduction of mesh stiffness can be obtained, then the damage dynamics of the gearbox system due to tooth pitting can be built. Afterwards, the dynamic responses of generalized parameters in the models of pitting levels can be simulated, and their condition indicators can be obtained by using effective signal processing methods. Then, the sensitivities of each generalized parameter to tooth damage can be calculated, and the optimal <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> can be determined according to the size of sensitivities. The simulation results show that monitoring the acceleration of gear and calculating its kurtosis can effectively track tooth pitting growth...|$|E
30|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the prescriber of lithium, generally a psychiatrist, was responsible for monitoring. The health care system should be organized in a way that continuity of monitoring is warranted. For instance, in the Dutch guideline, the prescriber is appointed to be responsible for monitoring (Kupka et al. 2015), but another health care professional can have a coordinating function. Among respondents, a small group reported that patients were automatically invited by a laboratory or physician for monitoring. Most responders had to request each monitoring parameter separately, which may increase the workload and demands awareness of health care professionals. A method to order all <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> after a prescription has been described, known as a corollary order (Wright and Sittig 2006). In this way, an order set of <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> could be developed to be used when a health care professional prescribes lithium. Clinical decision systems could be programmed in a way that all relevant <b>monitoring</b> <b>parameters</b> are automatically ordered after a lithium prescription.|$|E

30|$|Of course, {{these steps}} are not {{mandatory}} because sometimes the situation changes from one system to another, {{but it can}} be used as a guideline for prognostics system developers. In some cases, diagnostics system could not catch the starting of system degradation, because the degradation phenomenon could not be monitored. This happens when the degradation is due to internal system wears and tears and it is too difficult to have direct sensor readings of its deviation from normal values. In this case, using AI techniques to learn the relation between <b>monitored</b> <b>parameters</b> and system health is the best solution. Many tools from the data mining community can be used to discover the hidden relationships between the <b>monitored</b> <b>parameters</b> to explain the strange behavior of system degradation.|$|R
