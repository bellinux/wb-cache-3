5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and <b>mineralocorticoid</b> levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever.

5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and <b>mineralocorticoid</b> production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mineralocorticoid</b> {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a <b>mineralocorticoid,</b> {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E

25|$|Despite the inefficient {{production}} of aldosterone, the more characteristic <b>mineralocorticoid</b> effect of 11β-OH CAH is hypertension. Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme over{{production of}} 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak <b>mineralocorticoid,</b> but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of <b>mineralocorticoid</b> excess: salt retention, volume expansion, and hypertension.|$|E

25|$|Cortisol {{deficiency}} in CAH is usually partial, {{and not the}} most serious problem for an affected person. Synthesis of cortisol shares steps with synthesis of <b>mineralocorticoids</b> such as aldosterone, androgens such as testosterone, and estrogens such as estradiol. The resulting excessive or deficient production of these three classes of hormones produce the most important problems for people with CAH. Specific enzyme inefficiencies are associated with characteristic patterns of over- or underproduction of <b>mineralocorticoids</b> or sex steroids.|$|R
5000|$|Hypoadrenocorticism in dogs, or, as it {{is known}} in people, Addison's disease, is an {{endocrine}} system disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands fail to produce enough hormones for normal function. The adrenal glands secrete glucocorticoids such as cortisol [...] and <b>mineralocorticoids</b> such as aldosterone; when proper amounts of these are not produced, the metabolic and electrolyte balance is upset. <b>Mineralocorticoids</b> control the amount of potassium, salt and water in the body. Hypoadrenocorticism is fatal if left untreated.|$|R

25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the <b>mineralocorticoid</b> pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of <b>mineralocorticoid</b> excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns <b>mineralocorticoid</b> production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E

2500|$|Hypoadrenocorticism, {{also known}} as Addison's disease, is a {{reduction}} of production of glucocorticoids and <b>mineralocorticoids</b> by the adrenal glands. There is more familiarity with the glucocortcoids, such as cortisol; <b>mineralocorticoids</b> control the amount of potassium, salt and water in the body. It is most commonly caused by destruction of adrenal tissue, probably by autoimmune disease. Signs include increased drinking and urination, vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, shivering and weight loss; at times neither the causes nor symptoms are especially specific. Because of this it is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the Great Mimic" [...] or [...] "the Great Imitator". It is possible not to see any symptoms of the disease until the adrenal cortex is 90% dysfunctional. Addison's can occur when regular steroid use is abruptly discontinued; during their use, the system the adrenal gland does not function at 100%. The system senses sufficient levels of these hormones in the body and does not signal for their production. Tapering the medication off gradually allows them to return to full production after discontinuation. About 35% of affected dogs are not diagnosed until they experience an Addisonian crisis, which outwardly appears to be a [...] "classic" [...] shock and is a medical emergency. Hyperkalemia can develop and cause severe bradycardia. Only typical Addison's patients have the risk of Addisonian crisis {{due to the lack of}} <b>mineralocorticoids.</b> Treatment is with supplementation of <b>mineralocorticoids</b> in daily pills or a monthly injection. The atypical form and the form caused by abrupt withdrawal of steroids do not need <b>mineralocorticoids.</b> Glucocorticoids are usually supplemented with oral prednisone.|$|R

40|$|Glucocorticoids and <b>mineralocorticoids</b> are steroid hormones classically {{thought to}} be {{secreted}} exclusively by the adrenal glands. However, recent evidence has shown that corticosteroids can also be locally synthesized in various other tissues, including primary lymphoid organs, intestine, skin, brain, and possibly heart. Evidence for local synthesis includes detection of steroidogenic enzymes and high local corticosteroid levels, even after adrenalectomy. Local synthesis creates high corticosteroid concentrations in extra-adrenal organs, sometimes much higher than circulating concentrations. Interestingly, local corticosteroid synthesis can be regulated via locally expressed mediators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In some tissues (e. g., skin), these local control pathways might form miniature analogs of the pathways that regulate adrenal corticosteroid production. Locally synthesized glucocorticoids regulate activation of immune cells, while locally synthesized <b>mineralocorticoids</b> regulate blood volume and pressure. The physiological importance of extra-adrenal glucocorticoids and <b>mineralocorticoids</b> has been shown, because inhibition of local synthesis has major effects even in adrenal-intact subjects. In sum, while adrenal secretion of glucocorticoids and <b>mineralocorticoids</b> into the blood coordinates multiple organ systems, local synthesis of corticosteroids results in high spatial specificity of steroid action. Taken together, studies of these five major organ systems challenge the conventional understanding of corticosteroid biosynthesis and function...|$|R

50|$|Treatments for Glycerol Kinase Deficiency are {{targeted}} {{to treat the}} symptoms {{because there are no}} permanent treatments for this disease. The main way to treat these symptoms is by using corticosteroids, glucose infusion, or <b>mineralocorticoids.</b> Corticosteroids are steroid hormones that are naturally produced in the adrenal glands. These hormones regulate stress responses, carbohydrate metabolism, blood electrolyte levels, as well as other uses. The <b>mineralocorticoids,</b> such as aldosterone control many electrolyte levels and allow the kidneys to retain sodium. Glucose infusion is coupled with insulin infusion to monitor blood glucose levels and keep them stable.|$|R
50|$|Glucuronidation {{is often}} {{involved}} in xenobiotic metabolism of substances such as drugs, pollutants, bilirubin, androgens, estrogens, <b>mineralocorticoids,</b> glucocorticoids, fatty acid derivatives, retinoids, and bile acids. These linkages involve glycosidic bonds.|$|R

25|$|Licorice, {{which has}} {{indirect}} <b>mineralocorticoid</b> activity by inhibiting <b>mineralocorticoid</b> metabolism, {{has been found}} in studies to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with the drug for hyperandrogenism, and licorice may hence be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, spironolactone is clinically useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|NET is {{a potent}} {{progestogen}} and a weak androgen and estrogen. That is, it {{is a potent}} agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) and a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). NET itself has insignificant affinity for the ER; its estrogenic activity is from an active metabolite that is formed in very small amounts, ethinylestradiol (EE), {{which is a very}} potent estrogen. NET and its metabolites have negligible affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and <b>mineralocorticoid</b> receptor (MR) and hence have no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, <b>mineralocorticoid,</b> or antimineralocorticoid activity.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is a progestogen, or an agonist of {{the nuclear}} {{progesterone}} receptors (PRs), the PRA, PRB, and PRC. In addition to the PR, progesterone is an agonist of the membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), including the mPRα, mPRβ, mPRγ, mPRδ, and mPRϵ. It is also a potent antimineralocorticoid (antagonist of the <b>mineralocorticoid</b> receptor), {{as well as a}} very weak glucocorticoid (agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor). An active metabolite of progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), is a precursor of aldosterone and has strong <b>mineralocorticoid</b> activity (i.e., is a strong agonist of the <b>mineralocorticoid</b> receptor). However, it is formed in relatively low amounts, and any such effects produced by it are usually outweighed by the antimineralocorticoid activity of progesterone. In accordance, a 200mg dose of OMP is said to be approximately equivalent in antimineralocorticoid effect to a 25 to 50mg dose of spironolactone. Progesterone does not bind to the androgen receptor or to the estrogen receptor.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{inhibits}} {{the effects}} of <b>mineralocorticoids,</b> namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from MR in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed onset of action, and so it takes several days for diuresis to occur. This is because the MR is a nuclear receptor which works through regulating gene transcription and gene expression, in this case, to decrease the production and expression of ENaC and ROMK electrolyte channels in the distal nephrons. In addition to direct antagonism of the MRs, the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone may also in part be mediated by direct inactivation of steroid 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase), enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of <b>mineralocorticoids.</b> If levels of <b>mineralocorticoids</b> are decreased then there are lower circulating levels to compete with spironolactone to influence gene expression as mentioned above. The onset of action of the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone is relatively slow, with the peak effect sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first dose.|$|R
