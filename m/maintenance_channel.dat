The valley bottom is half a kilometer wide {{at this point}} and is spanned by the dam of a further flood control basin. Leaving the town, the bed of the Sulm has been straightened where it passes through the Sulmtalpark, which was created in 1975. Within the territory of Neckarsulm, there were previously mills along its course; the Nähermühle, at the city border, was removed in 1988. At this point the Sulm previously flowed in a wide curve to the north and then the west through the grounds of the NSU Motorenwerke plant; following two floods in 1970, it was diverted into a culvert in 1973 - 75. It now flows underground for more than 2.6 km and at the border between Neckarsulm and Bad Friedrichshall at the Neckar Canal, this section of which was completed in 1925, is piped under the canal. A little upstream of the canal, the Sulm can be seen in a <b>maintenance</b> <b>channel</b> several metres below.|$|E
40|$|In 2001, the Washington State Legislature {{established}} the Transportation Permit Efficiency and Accountability Committee (TPEAC) to identify measures to streamline permit procedures for transportation activities and improve environmental outcomes. A programmatic subcommittee {{was created to}} develop a multi-agency approach for developing programmatic permits that would cover 60 to 70 percent of Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) activities (mostly maintenance and preservation work). The subcommittee envisioned that the process for developing programmatic permits would involve establishing common conditions between jurisdictional agencies for similar categories of transportation-related activities. Agreement on common conditions would lead to programmatic permit approval issued by each agency that would cover the subject activities as they occur throughout the state. Agencies involved in this effort included NOAA Fisheries, USFWS, Corps, Washington State Departments of Ecology and Fish and Wildlife, local agency representatives and tribe representatives. In July 2004, the subcommittee had completed developing multi-agency programmatic approval for bridge and ferry terminal painting and washing, bridge and ferry terminal deck replacement, bridge and ferry terminal maintenance and repair, fish way <b>maintenance,</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance, culvert maintenance, culvert replacement, LWD removal from bridges, beaver dam removal, sediment test boring in all state waters, and 40 pile replacement in marine water. Much of this work was performed in the field during 2004 using programmatic permit coverage. In January 2005, WSDOT received and compiled information regarding the performance of these programmatic permits during the 2004 calendar year. This presentation compares the performance results from 2004 with the initial goals and expectations established by the subcommittee (mainly focusing on percent activities covered). The presentation further expands on results including time and cost savings for both WSDOT and permit agencies, environmental benefit, and other lessons learned...|$|E
30|$|Constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> is {{the area}} {{necessary}} to maintain 1 ft of drainage channel. The constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> represents the drainage area required to maintain one unit of channel length; hence, it {{is a measure of}} watershed erodibility. Schumn (1954) proposed the use of the reciprocal of drainage density for calculating the constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and the same method has been adopted for the present study. Regions of resistant rock type or with the surface of high permeability or with good forests cover should have a high constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> and a low drainage density. Similarly, regions of weak rock types or region with little or no vegetation and low soil infiltration and permeability should have low constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> and high drainage density. The constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> varies from 0.16 (watershed 32) to 0.75 (watershed 9). Lower values (less than 0.3) are found for watershed 12, 15, 26 and 32 (Table  3). These values reflect the low infiltration and permeability, poor vegetal cover and weak rock types. On the other hand, the constant of <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> values are found to be higher (>[*] 0.5) for watersheds 6, 9, 10 and 23 which reflect the higher infiltration and permeability of the materials, fairly good vegetal cover and relatively resistant rock type.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{concern of}} this study is the examination of sedimentation and sedimentary processes in a rock-walled tidal inlet, Lyttelton Harbour. The harbour is distinctive from other forms of inlets commonly discussed in the literature due primarily to a negligible freshwater input, lateral grain size contours which are parallel to current flow paths, and a <b>maintenance,</b> <b>channel</b> dredging programme which greatly exceeds the natural harbour sedimentation rates. A further unusual characteristic of the harbour is the lateral limitation imposed on processes within the harbour by the surrounding rigid, rock boundaries. These boundaries influence and control circulation patterns within the harbour through the interaction between processes and geometry. Thus Lyttelton Harbour is a structurally controlled tidal inlet. The only harbour boundary which is free to respond to changes in the system is the bed. For these reasons traditional inlet concepts, applicable to estuaries and inlets with unconsolidated boundaries, were found to be unsatisfactory for explaining how Lyttelton Harbour operates. The study approach involves fieldwork and analysis of both sedimentary and hydraulic processes within the harbour. A bed sediment survey showed that the harbour can be divided along its longitudinal axis with very fine mud sediments on the northern side, and coarser, sandier sediments on the southern side. All bed sediments are predominantly fine, and a survey of near-bed suspended sediment concentrations revealed fluid mud layers on the northern side of the harbour, at the harbour entrance, and within the channel. The primary hydraulic processes operating are tidal currents, although a mixed wave field, comprising ocean swell and locally generated wind waves, frequently penetrates the harbour. Tidal current velocities are on average around 0. 22 ms-¹, with flood tide velocities stronger {{on the south side of}} the harbour and ebb tide velocities stronger on the north side, inducing a clockwise circulation pattern. External factors are an important component in the tidal driving forces, comprising coastal weather patterns and a continental shelf edge wave oscillation effect with a period of 2. 5 - 3. 5 hours. These external influences are the main cause of the duration of both ebb and flood tides varying from 5. 0 to 8. 25 hours. Interaction between tidal currents and the harbour geometry induces a large gyre in the outer harbour which varies in duration from being absent to operating for up to 50 % of any given tidal cycle. The transport of sand sized material is bidirectional along the harbour length, with erosion of sandy sediments in the centre of the harbour, and deposition at the head of the harbour and at the harbour entrance. Fine muddy sediments are transported predominantly towards the harbour entrance and accumulate in the channel, on the northern side, and in the entrance, forming fluid mud layers. The most concentrated fluid mud regions coincide with the rotatory currents at both ends of the tidal gyre, where sediment is deposited from weaker currents. Transport of sand across the harbour is not apparent, although lateral movement of fine, suspended particles occurs by advection and diffusion in response to the sediment flux differentials and flux gradients within the harbour. This movement of fines results in the lateral gradation of grain size, from coarse to fine, across the harbour from south to north. The major sedimentary process within the harbour is the maintenance dredging programme which removes up to 1, 000, 000 tonnes of sediment annually from the channel and port berthage areas. The dredge spoil is subsequently dumped within the harbour along the northern perimeter, although a temporal analysis of dump sites indicated that once a site capacity has been attained, all the spoil dumped at that location is rapidly removed. Sediment input from other sources, primarily erosion of the catchment, has been estimated at less than 45, 000 tonnes per annum, substantially less than the channel siltation rate, and the recirculation of dredge spoil was identified as the primary source of sediment causing channel siltation. Two processes induce spoil recirculation. Firstly the tidal gyre, and secondly the dynamic trap. The dynamic trap system provides a mechanism for the transport of fine grained sediments to regions of high sediment flux, and for the deposition of fine grained sediments under current regimes having both a high competence and a high capacity. The system provides an explanation for the lateral grain size gradation within the harbour, the maintenance of dredge spoil mounds at dump sites, the insensitivity of channel siltation rates to the location of spoil dumping sites around the harbour, and the quasi-equilibrium state of the harbour in spite of the extensive dredging operations. Little sediment is able to escape from the harbour to the open sea due to the flux gradients at the entrance, and the dynamic trap principles. Thus the long term stability of Lyttelton Harbour is maintained, under both natural and dredging conditions, by the redistribution of available sediment within the harbour as a function of internal harbour dynamics. Throughout the thesis the dynamics of Lyttelton Harbour are compared to existing inlet concepts and theories in order to identify those areas in which this type of inlet is significantly different and where other, poorly understood inlets may be comparable to Lyttelton. Finally, Lyttelton Harbour is defined and classified and a set of principles pertaining to this type of inlet are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Reservoir {{releases}} may be specified for {{the purpose}} of maintaining or improving the downstream channel and habitat. A wide variety of ecological or management objectives may be defined for such flushing flows (which may be broadly divided into sediment <b>maintenance</b> and <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> flows). To specify a particular discharge and water volume for a flushing flow requires that the ecological or management objectives be translated into specific physical objectives for which flows can be specified. Flushing objectives that cannot be translated into definable flows are of little practical use, regardless of their intrinsic importance. Once defined, flushing flow objectives may be shown to conflict in some cases. For example, no flushing flow can satisfy the typical sediment maintenance objectives of maximizing sand removal and minimizing gravel loss. A discharge that mobilizes sediment throughout the channel cross section for <b>channel</b> <b>maintenance</b> purposes will often produce comparable transport rates of sand and gravel, thereby eliminating the selective transport of sand needed to reduce the sand content in the bed. Some nonflushing alternatives, such as artificial gravel replenishment and pool dredging, can be used to improve the performance of flushing flows. Selection among these alternatives and specification of a flushing flow discharge and volume depend directly on quantitative estimates of sand and gravel transport as a function of flow rate and volume...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the high}} rate of {{sediment}} deposition that surpasses the federally-mandated total maximum daily load, Los Peñasquitos Lagoon is listed as a category 5 impaired body of water under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. This is primarily due to the adverse effects of sedimentation in the lagoon itself and also within its vast watershed. These effects include drops in photosynthetic productivity, higher concentrations of heavy metals, and overall loss of ecosystem biodiversity within the estuary. In addition to ecological impacts, sedimentation in the Los Peñasquitos watershed has led to significant issues within its storm water infrastructure. Specifically, sediment accumulation in flood control channels has greatly reduced original storm water conveyance capacity. This is primarily due to the vegetation that grows within the channels as a result of siltation. Regular <b>maintenance</b> of these <b>channels</b> by the Storm Water Division is therefore a necessity to ensure proper flood control.
