In both cases, Burger King prominently used the names of the Kraft products, A1 Steak Sauce and Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce, in the names of the sandwiches.

During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a <b>macaroni</b> <b>and</b> glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the nutritive value of grades 1 and 2 wheat feed {{screening}} <b>and</b> <b>macaroni</b> wastes as energy resources, 360 21 -day-old broiler chicks were divided into 36 groups of 10. In this experiment, each experimental levels of feedstuff was used at 0 (control group), 15, 30 and 45 %. In addition, their apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) was determined by Sibbald’s method. Daily feed intake of chicks fed by diets containing <b>macaroni</b> wastes <b>and</b> grade 1 wheat feed screening for 21 to 56 days of age was significantly lower than that {{in the control group}} (P&lt; 0. 05). In contrast, body weight, daily weight gain and feed conversion had no significant differences during this period. However, in the total experimental period, the best feed conversion belonged to chicks fed with various levels of <b>macaroni</b> wastes <b>and</b> grade 1 wheat feed screening. Apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) of <b>macaroni</b> wastes <b>and</b> wheat feed screening were 3700, 3270, and 2870 kcal/kg, respectively. According to the results of this experiment, it is possible to use <b>macaroni</b> wastes <b>and</b> grade 1 wheat feed screening at 45 % and 30 % levels in the diet of broiler chicks, respectively, without any undesirable effects on their performance...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the federal regulations under 21 CFR Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA’s standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of <b>macaroni</b> <b>and</b> noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut’s law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain grain products, including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.|$|E

25|$|On 20 May 1863, Lord Clifden faced 30 {{rivals in}} the Derby Stakes at Epsom Downs. Ridden again by George Fordham, {{he started the}} race as the 4/1 favourite. Also {{near the front of}} the betting were Hospender and Gellie at 9/1 and <b>Macaroni</b> <b>and</b> Saccharometer at 10/1. There was a delay to the start of almost one hour after the horses were fifteen minutes late going to post and then there were over thirty false starts. When they finally got under way, Lord Clifden was {{positioned}} in about tenth place by Fordham, as Bright Cloud led the field. With one mile still to run Bright Cloud faded and left Donnybrook and Lord Clifden in the lead. The Cloud was in third place until the six-furlong pole, where he swerved and brought down Saccharometer. The incident also caused King of the Vale to unseat his rider and almost brought down Fantastic. As the horses rounded Tattenham Corner, Lord Clifden had a slight lead over Donnybrook, with Tom Fool lying in third. As then entered the finishing straight Donnybrook and Lord Clifden's nearest challengers were Tom Fool and Macaroni. Inside the final furlong Macaroni closed down the leader and with Lord Clifden stumbling in the last stride got the better and won by a short-head. Rapid Rhone finished in third place, half a length behind <b>Macaroni</b> <b>and</b> Lord Clifden. After the race many people thought that the race was either a dead heat or that Lord Clifden had won. The following day Lord Clifden turned out for the Great Surrey Foal Stakes, where his only rival was the French horse Jarnicoton. Lord Clifden led until the final furlong, where he was challenged. The pair raced side by side, but Jarnicoton's stirrup broke and Lord Clifden won by a head.|$|E
