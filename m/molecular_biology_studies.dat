50|$|Supporters of the ceRNA {{hypothesis}} {{believe that}} this experiment is challenging and would not provide any further evidence since many 3' UTR sites can affect the regulation of one target, and mutating them may have unintended consequences on mRNA structure or regulation by other factors. It is further criticized that the studies by Denzler et al. only focus on competition for a single miRNA. Since ceRNA regulations are orchestrated through the cooperative effect of multiple miRNA families, the study by Denzler et al. does not represent a typical ceRNA competitor and can therefore {{not be used to}} generalize. In addition, supporters are not surprised that our mechanistic understanding of ceRNA regulation is incomplete. Instead, they point out that hundreds of genetics and <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> <b>studies</b> have found ceRNA regulation physiologically relevant.|$|E
50|$|As RNA {{integrity}} {{has long}} been known to be a problem in <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> <b>studies,</b> there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA. The most popular {{has long been}} agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining, allowing one to visualize the bands from the rRNA peaks. The height of the 28S and 18S bands can be compared to each other, with a 2:1 ratio indicating non-degraded RNA. While this method is very cheap and easy, there are several issues with this method, primarily its subjectivity, leading to inconsistent, non-standardized RNA quality assessments, and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel, which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with. There are also a number of different problems that can arise from agarose gel electrophoresis, such as poor loading, uneven running, and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using agarose gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity. Clearly, a standardized, repeatable, objective method of determining RNA integrity was needed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mycoplasmas are a {{large group}} of bacteria, sorted into {{different}} genera in the Mollicutes class, whose main characteristic in common, besides the small genome, is the absence of cell wall. They are considered cellular and <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> <b>study</b> models. We present an updated review of the <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> of these model microorganisms and the development of replicative vectors for the transformation of mycoplasmas. Synthetic <b>biology</b> <b>studies</b> inspired by these pioneering works became possible and won the attention of the mainstream media. For the first time, an artificial genome was synthesized (a minimal genome produced from consensus sequences obtained from mycoplasmas). For the first time, a functional artificial cell has been constructed by introducing a genome completely synthesized within a cell envelope of a mycoplasma obtained by transformation techniques. Therefore, this article offers an updated insight to {{the state of the art}} of these peculiar organisms' <b>molecular</b> <b>biology...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1900s, {{many factors}} {{prompted}} hemoglobin research in Baltimore, Maryland and {{ultimately led to}} the discovery of Hemoglobin Hopkins-2. First, the development of new technology, including x-ray crystallography and protein chemistry, that could be utilized in <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> <b>studies</b> catalyzed research. [...] Furthermore, the large presence of thalassemia (Hb H), a disorder in which the alpha gene is dysfunctional, in Southeast Asia and southern China further concerned researchers as, if left untreated, the mutation could result in bone deformities, swelling of the spleen, slowed growth rate, or cardiac dysfunction. [...] Additionally, Max Perutz's, a Cambridge researcher, discovery of hemoglobin's basic tertiary structure in 1962 catalyzed research in hematology. [...] Vernon Ingram's research surrounding sickle cell anemia in 1956 revealed that variants, or mutations, in hemoglobin's RNA resulted in the sickle cell disease.Ernest W. Smith and J.V. Norbert examined Ingram's discovery and, in 1958, they discovered the hemoglobin Hopkins-2 mutation. Smith and Torbert, research fellows working in Lockard Conley's Hematology Research Department at Johns Hopkins University, proved that recombination of non-allelic genes resulted in two variants of the gene that produced hemoglobin. Variants of the [...] "normal" [...] hemoglobin gene result in mutation in the hemoglobins produced. [...] In other words, the researchers discovered two versions of hemoglobin: the Hb-Hop2 and S variants.|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} of additional cannabinoid receptors {{has long been}} suspected, due to the actions of compounds such as abnormal cannabidiol that produce cannabinoid-like effects on blood pressure and inflammation, yet do not activate either CB1 or CB2. Recent research strongly supports {{the hypothesis that the}} N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) receptor GPR18 is the molecular identity of the abnormal cannabidiol receptor and additionally suggests that NAGly, the endogenous lipid metabolite of anandamide (also known as arachidonoylethanolamide or AEA), initiates directed microglial migration in the CNS through activation of GPR18. Other <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> <b>studies</b> have suggested that the orphan receptor GPR55 should in fact be characterised as a cannabinoid receptor, on the basis of sequence homology at the binding site. Subsequent studies showed that GPR55 does indeed respond to cannabinoid ligands. This profile as a distinct non-CB1/CB2 receptor that responds to a variety of both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid ligands, has led some groups to suggest GPR55 should be categorized as the CB3 receptor, and this re-classification may follow in time. However this is {{complicated by the fact that}} another possible cannabinoid receptor has been discovered in the hippocampus, although its gene has not yet been cloned, suggesting that there may be at least two more cannabinoid receptors to be discovered, in addition to the two that are already known. GPR119 has been suggested as a fifth possible cannabinoid receptor.|$|E
