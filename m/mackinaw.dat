5|$|US131 and its {{predecessors}} bears several memorial designations {{in addition to}} the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the <b>Mackinaw</b> Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to <b>Mackinaw</b> City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The <b>Mackinaw</b> Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and <b>Mackinaw</b> City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.|$|E
5|$|M-108 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The highway followed Nicolet Street, although some maps also labeled it as <b>Mackinaw</b> Highway. The road was on the boundary between Emmet and Cheboygan counties.|$|E
5|$|US23 {{follows the}} Lake Huron {{shoreline}} through Cheboygan County through woodlands past Cheboygan State Park and Duncan Bay. On {{the eastern edge}} of Cheboygan the highway intersects F-05 before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the Cheboygan River on the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge near the mouth of the river and the dock for the USCGC <b>Mackinaw.</b> On {{the west side of the}} river, US23 meets the northern terminus of M-27 at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as C-66 as US23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on <b>Mackinaw</b> Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward <b>Mackinaw</b> City. As it approaches the village, it passes Historic Mill Creek State Park and several motels. At Nicolet Street in town, the highway crosses into Emmet County for the short distance to the highway's national northern terminus at I-75's exit338.|$|E

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{follows the}} railroad into Antrim and Mancelona. North of downtown Mancelona M-66 turns north toward Charlevoix and US131 continues along the <b>Mackinaw</b> Trail, through Alba. M-32 follows US131 {{for a half}} mile (0.8km) near the community of Elmira. As it continues farther north US131 enters the <b>Mackinaw</b> State Forest. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US131: 5,114cars and 448trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern {{section of the city}} of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians. At the northern terminus of US131, US31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of <b>Mackinaw</b> City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of <b>Mackinaw</b> City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD {{requested}} additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 {{under the}} Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including a freeway along US23 between Standish and <b>Mackinaw</b> City. This extension {{was rejected by}} Congress on December 13, 1968; instead, Michigan was allotted additional mileage for an extension of I-69 to Flint. Once {{the last piece of}} I-75 was completed along the M-76 corridor in November 1973, the I-75 designation was extended north of Bay City on US23.|$|E

5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was formed}} on May 13, 1913, and several {{sections}} of the system were designated along {{the course of the}} then-future I-75. Division1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division2 connected Detroit with <b>Mackinaw</b> City. A branch of Division7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie. The system was signposted in 1919, and those highways were marked on maps for the first time. The first M-10 was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish. M-76 connected Standish with Grayling, where the first M-14 ran northward to Cheboygan. From there, M-10 connected to <b>Mackinaw</b> City. In the UP, M-12 connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail. When the United States Numbered Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, most of these highways were redesignated as part of the national system. From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of US24 and US25. At Detroit, M-10 was used as a part of US10. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of US27. M-12 was used for US2.|$|E
5|$|The first M-11 {{originally}} {{ran along}} Lake Michigan between the Indiana state line near New Buffalo and <b>Mackinaw</b> City on July 1, 1919. On November 11, 1926, the New Buffalo–Benton Harbor segment {{was used for}} US12 and the Watervliet–Mackinaw City section was used for US31; between Benton Harbor and Watervliet, M-11 was used for a concurrent US12/US31. Streets are still designated as Old M-11 {{in places such as}} Chikaming Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US23 corridor were numbered M-65 from the Ohio line {{north to the}} Flint area and M-10 from Flint north to <b>Mackinaw</b> City by July 1, 1919. When originally designated, M-65 was in two sections: the southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. The {{gap between the two}} segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926.|$|E
2500|$|Melton Mowbray {{is home to}} Melton cloth (first {{mentioned}} in 1823), which is a tight-woven woollen cloth that is heavily milled, and a nap raised so as to form a short, dense, non-lustrous pile. Sailors' pea coats are traditionally made of Melton cloth, the universal workmans' donkey jackets of Britain and Ireland and in North America, loggers' [...] "cruising jackets" [...] and <b>Mackinaws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between November 8 and 10, the Nez Perce left Fort Buford for Custer's post command at {{the time}} of his death; Fort Abraham Lincoln across the Missouri River from Bismarck in the Dakota Territory.

6000|$|Bea and Miles Bjornstam {{were married}} in June, a month after [...] "The Girl from Kankakee." [...] Miles had turned respectable. He had renounced his criticisms of state and society; {{he had given up}} roving as horse-trader, and wearing red <b>mackinaws</b> in lumber-camps; he had gone to work as {{engineer}} in Jackson Elder's planing-mill; he was to be seen upon the streets endeavoring to be neighborly with suspicious men whom he had taunted for years.|$|R
5|$|I-75 takes a {{more direct}} route between Indian River and <b>Mackinaw</b> City. M-27 follows old US27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan. With US23 it is a scenic, if indirect, {{alternative}} to I-75 on its approach to the Mackinac Bridge. M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms {{the main street of}} Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 runs parallel to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the {{southern}} end of US31 was given a second designation when US33 was extended into the state from Indiana to terminate in St. Joseph. Later that year, the US31A in the Holland area was decommissioned. The next year, the US31 concurrency was removed from US2 in the Upper Peninsula and the former highway no longer crossed the Straits of Mackinac, terminating instead in <b>Mackinaw</b> City. By the early 1940, the Muskegon Bypass was given the US31 designation, and the route downtown was redesignated US31A.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Mackinac Bridge, {{travelers}} wishing to venture from St. Ignace to <b>Mackinaw</b> City had to do so via ferry. M-122 began at US2 (now Business Loop Interstate 75) near Straits State Park and traveled through town along Ferry Road where it ran southeasterly from the main highway. East of Hornbach Street M-122 curved around to the east near Paro Street. The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast side of the city next to the Coast Guard station.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Mackinaws</b> were flecked far {{and wide}} over the lake, and a dirty smudge on the blue showed where the Far Harbor and Beaverton boat had gone over the horizon. But there, over the point and dangerously close to the land, hung another smudge, {{gradually}} pushing its way like a writhing, black serpent, lakewards. Thus I was rudely jerked back to face the problem with which we had left the island that morning.|$|R
60|$|About half-past eleven Mr. Cooke's {{vigilance}} {{was rewarded}} by {{a glimpse of}} the lighthouse on Far Harbor reef, and almost simultaneously he picked up, to the westward, the ragged outline of the house-tops and spires of the town itself. But as we neared the reef the harbor appeared as quiet as a Sunday morning: a few <b>Mackinaws</b> were sailing hither and thither, and the Far Harbor and Beaverton boat was coming out. My client, in view of the peaceful aspect affairs had assumed, presently consented to relinquish his post, and handed the glasses over to me with an injunction to be watchful.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the period}} before the Bolshevik victory, trade goods {{included}} [...] "foodstuffs, canned milk, canned fruit, clothing {{of every kind}} (including frilly things for women), hardware of all kinds, toys for children, a great many luxuries which {{many of them had}} never known before." [...] Trade goods mentioned at other locations in Swenson's narrative include flour, wieners (in barrels), oranges, sugar, tea, tobacco, pilot bread, eggs, calico, dishes, needles, thread, knives, pots, pans, chamber pots, firearms and ammunition, motor launches, gasoline, kerosene, <b>Mackinaws</b> and other waterproof clothing, boots, caps, heavy woolen clothing, and corduroy breeches with lacings on the legs. Customers included Russians as well as natives. Alcohol is not mentioned in his lists of trade goods.|$|R
5|$|The MSHD started {{construction}} in 1936 {{on a new}} road that rerouted US2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in <b>Mackinaw</b> City and US2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M‑122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls.|$|E
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was created}} on May 13, 1913, by {{an act of}} the Michigan Legislature; at the time, one of the system's {{divisions}} corresponded to the initial segment of M-140. Division5 followed a course from Niles northward to <b>Mackinaw</b> City that encompassed the highway between Watervliet and South Haven. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future M-140 corridor was assigned to part of the original M-11. On November 11, 1926, M-11 was redesignated as part of US31 in the state.|$|E
5|$|The fifth fort to fall, Fort Michilimackinac (present <b>Mackinaw</b> City, Michigan), was {{the largest}} fort taken by surprise. On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball (a forerunner of lacrosse) with visiting Sauks. The {{soldiers}} watched the game, as they had done on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.|$|E

60|$|She {{rose to a}} {{radiance}} of sun on snow. Snug in her furs she trotted up-town. Frosted shingles smoked {{against a}} sky colored like flax-blossoms, sleigh-bells clinked, shouts of greeting were loud in the thin bright air, and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of wood-sawing. It was Saturday, and the neighbors' sons were getting up the winter fuel. Behind walls of corded wood in back yards their sawbucks stood in depressions scattered with canary-yellow flakes of sawdust. The frames of their buck-saws were cherry-red, the blades blued steel, and the fresh cut ends of the sticks--poplar, maple, iron-wood, birch--were marked with engraved rings of growth. The boys wore shoe-packs, blue flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons, and <b>mackinaws</b> of crimson, lemon yellow, and foxy brown.|$|R
5|$|When the {{original}} state trunklines were designated, an M-11 ran {{the length of}} the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to <b>Mackinaw</b> City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to <b>Mackinaw</b> City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day <b>Mackinaw</b> City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} noted {{incarnation of}} a university band was in 1904 when it was named the Western University of Pennsylvania. It consisted of eight young men whose official uniforms were inexpensive caps. After a few years, uniforms {{made up of a}} derby hat and a sweater were adopted, however, the uniforms never lasted longer than one season due to the especially fragile nature of the derby. [...] An official organization of a student marching band occurred in 1911, the year often cited as its date of establishment, and the band made its first appearance that year at Forbes Field on 14 October 1911 at the Pitt vs. Ohio Northern game with just 8 musicians in uniforms only consisting of scarlet felt caps with blue tassels. Band members played on seven instruments borrowed from Becher's Music Store. [...] The original band was organized by Dr. Earl Miller and James G. Oliver while Carl Sabad became the Student Leader and Don Kirk played the role of manager, who obtained commitments to its membership from 22 men. Half of the funding for the band was initially provided by the Athletic Council with the other half donated by students, alumni, and friends of the University. [...] Uniforms were provided in 1912, including <b>mackinaws,</b> from a donation by Edward V. Babcock.|$|R
5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of <b>Mackinaw</b> City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Oscoda is the {{location}} of the eastern termini of both the River Road National Scenic Byway and County Road F-41. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses the Au Sable River near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into Alcona County. The highway meets the eastern termini of F-30 and M-72 in Greenbush and Harrisville respectively. It also passes Harrisville State Park in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the <b>Mackinaw</b> State Forest. Near Ossineke, the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running along the shoreline of Thunder Bay.|$|E
