5|$|Corps {{replaced}} divisions as {{the largest}} army units, mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine. These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare.

5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow {{and they would be}} assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It was only in the latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became <b>more</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Chelsea and transitions undergone {{by the two}} clubs during the mid-2000s meant the rivalry became insignificant. Manchester United continued to compete for honours under Ferguson, winning 14 over the next 9 years, while Wenger at Arsenal endured a nine-year trophy drought. This was parralled with Wenger making the decision to displace experienced first-teamers in favour of youth and encourage a <b>more</b> <b>fluid,</b> less direct style of football.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{experiments}} {{in which a}} <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> displaces a less viscous one in a vertical cylindrical tube. These experiments were performed using silicone oils in a vertical pipette of small diameter. The <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> also had a slightly larger density than the less viscous fluid. In the initial configuration, the fluids were at rest, and the interface was nominally flat. A dye {{was added to the}} <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> for ease of observation of the interface between the fluids. The flow was initiated by pumping the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> into the less viscous one. The displacement velocity was such that the Reynolds number was smaller than unity and the Peclet number for mass transfer between the fluids was large compared to unity. For upward displacement of the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> from an initially stable configuration, an axisymmetric finger was observed under all conditions. However, a needle-shaped spike was seen to propagate from the main finger in many cases, similar to that observed by Petitjeans and Maxworthy for the displacement of a <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> by a less viscous one...|$|R
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{majority}} of the Australian Light Horse had remained in the Middle East and subsequently served in Egypt, Sinai, Palestine and Syria with the Desert Column of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In August 1917 the column was expanded to become the Desert Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). In contrast to the static trench warfare that developed in Europe, the troops in the Middle East mostly experienced a <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> form of warfare involving manoeuvre and combined arms tactics.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E
30|$|Wettability {{is defined}} as the {{relative}} adhesion of two fluids to a solid surface. In a porous medium, it is a measure of preferential tendency of one of the fluids to wet the surface. A porous medium usually contains two or <b>more</b> <b>fluids</b> (Tiab and Donaldson 2010).|$|R

5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
5|$|The Chancery came to {{prominence}} after {{the decline of}} the Exchequer, dealing with the law of equity, something <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> and adaptable than the common law. The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts, matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that the common law did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for common law bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{tried to}} redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning {{what they felt}} the character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, Underworld introduced motion capture-based animation to display <b>more</b> <b>fluid,</b> realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting {{with one hand while}} the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this. In response to Underworlds lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.|$|E
40|$|In many {{technological}} processes {{a fundamental}} stage involves {{the mixing of}} two or <b>more</b> <b>fluids.</b> As a result, optimal mixing protocols {{is a problem of}} both fundamental and practical importance. In this paper we formulate a prototypical mixing problem in a control framework, where the objective is to determine the sequence of fluid flows that will maximize entropy. By developing the appropriate ergodic-theoretic tools for the determination of entropy of periodic sequences, we derive the form of the protocol which maximizes entropy among all of the possible periodic sequences composed of two shear flows orthogonal to each other. We discuss the relevance of our results in the interpretation of previous studies of mixing protocols. 1 Introduction Mixing is a very important process in many engineering applications. For example, mixing between two or <b>more</b> <b>fluids</b> in a fuel-air mixture in combustion engines, enhances the efficiency of the combustion process.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{addressed}} to the engineer responsible for preparing the heat transfer equipment data sheet, on which will be specified all the parameters required by the vendor for tendering for the equipment. Initially, the engineer must decide the type of equipment best suited for his application: guidelines for this selection are given in Part A of this paper. Finally he must supply all the data required by the specialist for preparing his design. I n the case of proprietary equipment, this data {{will be limited to}} process details. For more general equipment, especially shell and tube heat exchangers, he also needs to supply some equipment specifications. Part B of the paper gives guidelines for preparing shell and tube heat exchanger data sheets. 1 INTRODUCLlON This discussion of the selection of heat exchangers will, in general, be limited to those in the process industries, where a large number of different types are used in a great variety of services.

5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the part-time militia. The small number of regular personnel were mostly artillerymen or engineers, and were generally assigned to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) began forming shortly after the outbreak of war, officially coming into being on 15 August 1914. Upon formation, the AIF consisted of the 1st Division and the 1st Light Horse Brigade. As part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), the 1st Division subsequently fought alongside the combined New Zealand and Australian Division at Gallipoli between April and December 1915, being reinforced by the 2nd Division which was later raised, as well as three light horse brigades. After being evacuated to Egypt the AIF was expanded to five infantry divisions, which were committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front in March 1916 as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Meanwhile, two mounted divisions remained in the Middle East to fight against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine, serving with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In contrast to the static trench warfare that developed in Europe, the troops in the Middle East mostly experienced a <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> form of warfare involving manoeuvre and combined arms tactics.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned {{a few blocks from}} the family home. Brown had driven his son to play in a basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with <b>more</b> <b>fluid</b> movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit larceny for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended by prosecutors. Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and stay out of trouble for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit larceny charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of miscible displacements in a cylindrical tube are being investigated experimentally and numerically, {{with a view}} to understand the complex processes that occur, for example, in enhanced oil recovery, hydrology, and filtration. We have observed complex shapes of the interface between two liquids that mix with each other when the less viscous liquid is displaced by the more viscous one in a tube. A less viscous fluid that displaces a <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> is known to propagate {{in the form of a}} "finger," and a flight experiment proposed by Maxworthy et al. to investigate the miscible-interface dynamics is currently being developed by NASA. From the current theory of miscible displacements, which was developed for a porous medium satisfying Darcy's law, it can be shown that in the absence of gravity the interface between the fluids is destabilized and thus susceptible to fingering only when a <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> is displaced by a less viscous one. Therefore, if the interface is initially flat and the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> displaces the less viscous fluid, the interface ought to be stable and remain flat. However, numerical simulations by Chen and Meiburg for such displacement in a cylindrical tube show that the interface is unstable and a finger of the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> is indeed formed. Preliminary experiments performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center show that not only can fingering occur when the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> displaces a less viscous one in a cylindrical tube, but also that under certain conditions the advancing finger achieves a sinuous or snakelike shape. These experiments were performed using silicone oils in a vertical pipette of small diameter. In the initial configuration, the <b>more</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> rested on top of the less viscous one, and the interface was nominally flat. A dye was added to the upper liquid for ease of observation of the interface between the fluids.
