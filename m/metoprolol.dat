25|$|Class II agents include atenolol, esmolol, propranolol, and <b>metoprolol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newer, more cardio-selective beta {{blockers}} (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or <b>metoprolol)</b> are now {{used in the}} treatment of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and <b>metoprolol</b> {{are more likely than}} other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia and vivid dreams, and nightmares. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced and increased awakening.|$|E
25|$|The more {{recently}} developed H2-receptor antagonists {{are less likely}} to alter CYP metabolism. Ranitidine is not as potent a CYP inhibitor as cimetidine, although it still shares several of the latter's interactions (such as with warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, <b>metoprolol,</b> and midazolam). Famotidine has negligible effect on the CYP system, and appears to have no significant interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example <b>metoprolol</b> and atenolol), partial adrenergic agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} pharmacokinetics, {{cimetidine}} in particular interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, labetalol, <b>metoprolol,</b> methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is a {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased {{blood levels of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as <b>metoprolol,</b> dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, {{as well as the}} CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Sertraline is often used in combination with stimulant medication for the treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety in ADHD. Amphetamine metabolism inhibits enzyme CYP2D6, but has not been known to interfere with Sertraline metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Nadolol {{is one of}} the {{preferred}} beta-blockers in the management of patients with LQTS for shortening of the QT interval and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. It is more efficacious than <b>metoprolol</b> in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events while on therapy and is equivalent to propranolol. Nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. For patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. It has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease but neither is well established.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} (within {{the last}} 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect {{and ability to}} produce bradycardia – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with systolic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. As with ACEI therapy, {{the addition of a}} β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve left ventricular function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and extended-release <b>metoprolol.</b> The antagonism of β1 inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, <b>metoprolol,</b> and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E

50|$|The active {{substance}} <b>metoprolol</b> is employed either as <b>metoprolol</b> succinate or as <b>metoprolol</b> tartrate (where 100 mg <b>metoprolol</b> tartrate corresponds to 95 mg <b>metoprolol</b> succinate). The tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation.|$|E
50|$|He {{has helped}} in {{outsourcing}} of several products like <b>Metoprolol</b> extended release + Amlodipine, <b>Metoprolol</b> XL + Ramipril, Cefoperazone + sulbactam (2:1 combination) and Quetiapine Sustained Released to various multi-national and Indian pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
50|$|That {{being said}} {{there is still a}} huge market for moprolol, both for {{hypertension}} and glaucoma treatment. A similar beta-blocker, <b>metoprolol,</b> that is very popular both overseas and in the US brought in an estimated €2.2 million in 2010 in Europe. <b>Metoprolol</b> is also sold for $2.93-$0.76 per pill here in the US. Since moprolol and <b>metoprolol</b> both treat hypertension the market and estimated sales should be the same, all of which is reasonable for this type of non-invasive treatment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metoprolol</b> has a {{very low}} melting point; around 120 C for the tartrate, and around 136 C for the succinate. Because of this, <b>metoprolol</b> is always {{manufactured}} in a salt-based solution, as drugs with low melting points are difficult to work with in a manufacturing environment. The free base exists as a waxy white solid, and the tartrate salt is finer crystalline material.|$|E

5000|$|Ciba-Geigy is a {{pharmaceutical}} laboratory which has manufactured and sold <b>metoprolol</b> tablets in Canada under the trade name “Lopresor” since 1977. <b>Metoprolol</b> is {{a prescription drug}} generally prescribed for hypertension. After Apotex obtained licenses to manufacture and sell <b>metoprolol</b> in Canada, its version of the tablets {{have had the same}} get-up (shape, size and colour) as those of Ciba-Geigy since 1986. Novopharm, another respondent joined in the action also manufactured tablets with the same get-up. The three drugs have been designated interchangeable pharmaceutical products by Ontario law, which means that a pharmacist may give a patient any one of them as long as the prescription does not specify no substitution.In June 1986 the Ciba-Geigy brought passing-off actions against Apotex and Novopharm, alleging that its <b>metoprolol</b> tablets have a unique get-up by reason of their size, shape and colour and that this get-up has become associated with its product. In order to establish that Apotex and Novopharm were engaged in passing off by confusing the public with their products, Ciba-Geigy needed to prove that the customers of these drugs were likely to be misled by the similarity of the products. [...] At the trial level, Ciba-Geigy failed to establish that the customers, namely physicians and pharmacists that prescribe or dispense <b>metoprolol,</b> were confused in choosing the brand of <b>metoprolol</b> to give to patients due to the similar appearance of the tablets. For this reason, the Supreme Court of Ontario refused to issue an interlocutory injunction because Ciba-Geigy failed to show that there was a [...] "serious issue" [...] to be tried.At the Court of Appeal, Ciba-Geigy argued that the customers affected by the passing-off should include ultimate consumer of the prescribed drug as {{they are likely to be}} confused by the similar appearance of the products in question. The Court of Appeal rejected its argument and dismissed the appeal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metoprolol</b> has a short {{half-life}} of 3 to 7 hours, so {{is taken}} {{at least twice}} daily or as a slow-release preparation.|$|E
5000|$|Beta {{blockers}} — e.g. Ziac or Lodoz (with bisoprolol), Nebilet Plus or Nebilet HCT (with nebivolol), Dutoprol or Lopressor HCT (with <b>metoprolol),</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|Bisoprolol has {{a higher}} degree of β1-selectivity {{compared}} to other β1-selective β-blockers such as atenolol, <b>metoprolol,</b> and betaxolol. However nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metoprolol</b> is {{used for}} a number of conditions, {{including}} hypertension, angina, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and prevention of migraine headaches.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{selectivity}} in {{blocking the}} beta1 receptors in the heart, <b>metoprolol</b> is also prescribed for off-label use in performance anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and other anxiety disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metoprolol</b> is used {{to treat}} angina (chest pain) and hypertension. It {{is also used to}} treat or prevent heart attack. Brand names for beta {{blockers}} include Lopressor and Toprol-XL.|$|E
