5|$|The {{front part}} of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.|$|E

Further exploration by Charles Waterton (1812) and Robert Schomburgk (1840) confirmed Humboldt's findings.|$|E

As Locke goes to the beach to get shovels, Sayid follows him and asks what really killed Eko. Locke says that the {{survivors}} call it [...] "The Monster", and further speculates that The Monster <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> brought them there and that Eko died for a reason, he just {{does not know what}} it is yet.

500|$|... "Sing for Me" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, with a {{duration}} of four minutes (...) [...] Its instrumentation consists of [...] "soft" [...] strings, a [...] "delicate" [...] piano melody and [...] "80s power ballad-type drums" [...] at its close. The key in which the structure was composed is changed {{during the course of the}} song. Aguilera's vocals span from E♭3 to E♭5. Aguilera's vocal performance garnered a comparison to Gabby Douglas and the vocal gymnastics that she projects from Mike Wass for Idolator. He also noted that although Carey would consider the vocals runs as [...] "over-the-top", they fit with the nature of the song. The song features a [...] "thunderous" [...] ironic chorus which consists of the lyrics Cause when I open my mouth, my whole heart comes out." [...] According to Chris Younie for 4Music, Aguilera belts the song out [...] "as if her life depends on it." [...] The [...] "reflective ballad" [...] <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> was created as a result of Aguilera singing [...] "Beautiful" [...] alone in her bedroom after the weak commercial response of Bionic. It represents a [...] "fine line" [...] between the [...] "her hurt over the Bionic backlash and the woe-is-me territory she occasionally veers into on some of the album’s worst tracks." [...] Aguilera tries to [...] "shake her insecurities" [...] during the lines [...] "I don't care what the world thinks or how I sound." [...] According to Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club, Aguilera [...] "discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abe {{was born}} on March 7, 1924 in Kita, Tokyo, Japan {{and grew up in}} Mukden (now Shenyang) in Manchuria. Abe's family was in Tokyo at the time due to his father's year of medical {{research}} in Tokyo. His mother had been raised in Hokkaido, while he experienced childhood in Manchuria. This triplicate assignment of origin was influential to Abe, who told Nancy Shields in a 1978 interview, [...] "I am essentially a man without a hometown. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> lies behind the 'hometown phobia' that runs in the depth of my feelings. All things that are valued for their stability offend me." [...] As a child, Abe was interested in insect-collecting, mathematics, and reading. His favorite authors were Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Franz Kafka, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Edgar Allan Poe.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.

2500|$|In other words, [...] "provoking disbelief in free will" [...] {{probably}} {{causes a}} belief in fatalism. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like [...] "my choices have causes, and an effect – so I affect my future", whereas fatalism is more like [...] "my choices have causes, but no effect – I am powerless". Fatalism, then, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> threatens people's sense of self-efficacy. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can {{be accounted for by}} participants developing {{a belief in}} fatalism when experiments attack belief in [...] "free will". To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply [...] "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly {{to the way in which}} mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 56 {{is part of}} the Fair Youth sonnets. [...] The sonnet's {{first line}} was {{inspired}} by George Whetstone's The Rocke of Regard (1576). [...] The sonnet is divided up into four quatrain, groups of four lines, and a couplet. [...] Sonnet 56 is puzzling because of its seemingly inappropriate placement next to Sonnet 55. In Sonnet 55, the poet's relationship with the young man is steady and secure, but here there is a sudden shift from confidence to deep insecurity. [...] In this sonnet the poet examines the [...] "quality of love." [...] It is not clear who's love is being addressed. [...] The poet's, [...] "his friend's, or that of both?" [...] The poet [...] "pleads for the love to be charged with fresh vigor." [...] At the same time, the poet suggests that a [...] "separation" [...] <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> the relationship needs in order to [...] "renew the intensity of their devotion." [...] It should noted that the identity of the [...] "Sweet love" [...] is not located in the poem and the ultimate fate of the relationship is left ambiguous. [...] Although, there may be clues of their fate {{in the rest of the}} Fair You Sonnets. [...] Shakespeare also uses metaphors for eating to talk about a sexual appetite.|$|E
