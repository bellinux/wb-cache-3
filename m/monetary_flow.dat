40|$|The initial {{theoretical}} {{connections between}} Leontief input-output models and Markov chains were established back in 1950 s. However, considering {{the wide variety}} of mathematical properties of Markov chains, so far {{there has not been a}} full investigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism. In this work, using the recently available world input-output database, we investigated the evolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a time series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving system via different known properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time, Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional index of economies welfare. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk, called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock in the activity of a node, and the latter is based on the number of times a specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of <b>monetary</b> <b>flow</b> across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the world economic network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high structural power results to a slower average <b>monetary</b> <b>flow</b> over the network, there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the network in terms of connectivity and the average flow of the money...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{transmission}} and wheeling pricing method {{based on the}} <b>monetary</b> <b>flow</b> tracing along power flow paths: the monetary flow-monetary path method. Active and reactive power flows are converted into monetary flows by using nodal prices. The method introduces a uniform measurement for transmission service usages by active and reactive powers. Because monetary flows {{are related to the}} nodal prices, the impacts of generators and loads on operation constraints and the interactive impacts between active and reactive powers can be considered. Total transmission service cost is separated into more practical line-related costs and system-wide cost, and can be flexibly distributed between generators and loads. The method is able to reconcile transmission service cost fairly and to optimize transmission system operation and development. The case study on the IEEE 30 bus test system shows that the proposed pricing method is effective in creating economic signals towards the efficient use and operation of the transmission system.

30|$|This paper {{constructs}} an IO {{table for}} the analysis of non-metallic mineral wastes to comprehensively identify the material flow in non-metallic mineral wastes and the related <b>monetary</b> <b>flow</b> among industries. The IO model addressing environmental loads is generally established as the Leontif-Duchin environmental input–output (EIO) model (Leontief 1970; Duchin 1990). While a normal IO table allocates monetary transactions of goods and services among each sector, such as industry, household, and government, {{in the form of a}} matrix, EIO tables are frequently developed by expanding the scope of allocation to include environmental loads such as waste, energy, and air pollutant (see, e.g., Leontief 1970; Bullard and Herendeen 1975; Nakamura and Kondo 2002; Guan and Hubacek 2008). Focusing on application to waste analyses in the IO model, Nakamura and Kondo (2002) establish the waste input–output (WIO) model, which explicitly identifies the interdependence between the flow of goods and waste in the entire economy, and the model has been applied to many case studies (see, e.g., Kagawa 2005; Kagawa et al. 2007; Reynolds et al. 2014; Tsukui et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This study {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} private intergenerational transfers from elderly parents to their middle-aged children with respect to social inequality within the children’s generation. Methods. With use of the nationally representative cross-sectional sample of the German Aging Survey, descriptive analyses as well as multivariate logistic regressions are used to identify the effects of three different types of private intergenerational transfers in the middle-age group (40 – 54 year olds, n 1, 719 for inter vivos and n 1, 446 for mortis causa transfers). Results. Transfers from parents or parents-in-law during the last 12 months—many of them smaller ones—are not significantly related to children’s income. Separated and divorced children have significantly higher probabilities of receiving such transfers, indicating a need-directed family transfer process. Larger transfers before the last 12 months are need directed as well and moreover positively related to income position. Bequests, finally, are positively related to income position while having no need component {{at the time of}} observation. Discussion. Whereas larger monetary transfers and bequests may increase social inequality in the children’s generation, a substantial part of the regular <b>monetary</b> <b>flow</b> from elderly parents to their adult children buffers situations of need. Public policy should take into account these different effects. Reducing the general level of public pensions would weaken regular transfer giving and thus lead to more inequality in the children’s generation. Higher taxation of very larg...|$|E
