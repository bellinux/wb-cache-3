40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{discussion}} from {{the first of a}} series of five seminars organized by the European Forum for Urban Security. The seminar took place in Bristol on 28 and 29 September 2006. Over the 2 days, it was attended by 30 people, including police, <b>municipal</b> emergency <b>planning</b> <b>officers,</b> security specialists and academics. The seminar focused on what could be done to prevent terrorism, with some attention given to minimizing the harms and disruption caused by terrorist incidents. There was a critique of a purely "warfare" or deterrence approach, as well as attempts by governments to feed off citizen's fears and legislate their way out of the problem. It was recognized that the media can be counter-productive in their coverage of terrorist attacks and threats by fuelling fear and giving terrorists the publicity they desire. The theme that came out strongly from this seminar is that prevention through both situational and social interventions is the key to a sustainable reduction in terrorism. Another theme was the importance of communication, negotiation and conflict resolution as means to defusing existing terrorist threats. It was understood that there is a need to recognize "difference" and respect, within limits, that people should be allowed to hold different political views and cultural aspirations, as it is prejudice and intolerance that often fuels extremism. As the paper suggests, the skills and knowledge for both prevention and mediation already exist within local authorities and voluntary organizations and they are regularly used for effective crime prevention. However, many local authorities and government departments are hiving off terrorism as a separate topic to be addressed by others (notably the security services, police and emergency planning departments), rather than as dealing with it as a part of what they do already to prevent crime and minimize harms. This paper examines the possibility of an alternative approach based on crime prevention and community safety...|$|R

40|$|Causes and {{consequences}} of alterations of <b>municipal</b> <b>plans</b> in Prague suburb Abstract The diploma thesis is concerned with {{town and country planning}} after the "Velvet revolution" in 1989. The surroundings of the capital are places where suburbanization takes place at present. Instruments, which can control the process of suburbanization, are very limited. Moreover there is a problem, that capital and its surroundings lay each in different administrative region. The <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> is currently key instrument by which can spatial development be influenced. Municipalities are therefore under pressure of private companies calling for extension of a built-up area. The aim of this thesis is to analyse causes {{and consequences}} of alterations of the <b>municipal</b> <b>plans,</b> which were procured in municipalities in the suburban territory of Prague, and to discover who are the main participants of these alterations.

Although, the municipal authorities had indicated their desire to preserve the Sete Fontes as a National monument and transform the area into a municipal park, the area continued to be identified for construction and road redevelopment, in the <b>municipal</b> <b>plan.</b> In the 1999-2000 <b>municipal</b> <b>plan,</b> three of the upper minas fell within an area classified as [...] "public utility" [...] and were zoned {{for the construction of}} a hospital in 2002.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of town and country {{planning}} as an instrument of spatial development. During its formation proces and its validity, the <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> is being substantially influenced by requirements of the specific area users for its utilization, either ditectly or through elected representatives, with concurrent influence of external socieoeconomic, political, physical geographical factors. The <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> represents a long term conception of spatial development and its segments, yet in the course of its validity, it is being completed and put into practice in the context of effect of those factors. The most significant socioeconomic change to affect the progress of {{town and country planning}} in the Czech Republic in last twenty years was the transformation of a socialist central planning-conception into a democratic conceptiton. The thesis deals with analysis of two documents - the current <b>Municipal</b> <b>plan</b> of Jablonec nad Nisou, issued 1998, including valid alterations, and new formation of <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> Jablonec nad Nisou in the stage of authorized concept. The aim of the thesis is mainly an attempt to identify the dominant internal and external reasons which lead the change of the development priorities, or rather implementation/non-implementation of the original documents.

Some {{of the main}} opportunities and challenges for the uptake and implementation of web-based PPGIS are derived from a literature review and two case studies dealing with <b>municipal</b> <b>planning</b> for urban densification in the Stockholm region, Sweden. A simple clustering analysis identified three interconnected themes that together determine the performance of PPGIS: (i) tool design and affordances; (ii) organisational capacity; and (iii) governance.

40|$|The Saudi {{government}} has made some efforts in incorporating the principles of sustainable development into the planning process by establishing a framework for considering environmental consequences of development activities. The framework is guided by the General Environmental Code. The Ministerial Committee on the Environment (MCE) coordinates the environmental assessment of plans, policies and programmes prior to approval. However, the framework tends to focus on plans and programmes {{at the national level}} with little or no explicit provision for ensuring the assessment of <b>municipal</b> <b>plans,</b> policies and programmes. This paper evaluates the integration of environmental assessment into the <b>municipal</b> <b>planning</b> process and the plan documents. The findings indicate that the implementation of environmental assessment at the <b>municipal</b> <b>planning</b> level is minimal. Inadequate institutional framework and lack of effective environment assessment legislation are the main barriers to the implementation. Overall, the assessment shows that there is the need to improve sustainability planning practice in the Kingdom.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} debate {{regarding}} {{the national interest}} for cultural heritage management which is an instrument of urban planning in Sweden. The thesis also makes a comparison between three areas that have been assigned as national interests for cultural heritage conservation. The areas are Mölndals Kvarnby in Mölndal, Jonsered in Partille and Rydboholm in Borås. In the comparison, the general <b>municipal</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>municipal</b> detailed <b>plans</b> and programs for heritage planning are studied. The results show that {{there are differences in}} how the areas are treated in <b>municipal</b> <b>planning.</b> Mölndals Kvarnby who has evolved most since industry closures in the area has the most protected regulations in detailed plans. Jonsered has partial protection in detailed plans and local area plans. Rydboholm is the area that has undergone the least change and has the least protection. The study also shows the correlation between how areas are reported in the general <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> and the actual work in the areas. Clear reporting and viewpoint in the general <b>municipal</b> <b>plan</b> provides the conditions for continued work on areas of planning. The debate surrounding the instrument and the case study suggests that more antiquarian expertise on a local level or more knowledge at a government level to case work of national interest for cultural heritage conservation. More antiquarian competence at the municipal level would increase the prerequisites for discussion on development in areas of national interest for cultural heritage conservation.
