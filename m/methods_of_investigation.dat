He adopted the traditional titles of the kings of Naples"King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Duke of Apulia and Prince of Capua"and administered the kingdom from the Castel Nuovo, garrisoning his mercenaries in the most important forts. He used unusually brutal <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> to capture all accomplices in the death of his brother, according to Domenico da Gravina. Most local noble families (including the Balzos and the Sanseverinos) refused to cooperate with him. The pope refused to confirm Louis's rule in Naples, which would have united two powerful kingdoms under Louis's rule. The pope and the cardinals declared Queen Joanna innocent of her husband's murder at a formal meeting of the College of Cardinals.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of anthropological <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> on linguistic sources {{leads to the}} discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in language documentation, with an endeavour to curate endangered languages. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{his more}} general works the boldest and most {{far-reaching}} was Grimm's Geschichte der deutschen Sprache (History of the German Language), in which linguistic elements are emphasized. The {{subject of the}} work is the history hidden {{in the words of the}} German language (the oldest natural history of the Teutonic tribes determined by means of language). To this end he laboriously collected scattered words and allusions found in classical literature, and endeavoured to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the Getae, Thracians, Scythians, and many other nations whose languages were at the time known only through doubtfully identified, often extremely corrupted remains preserved by Greek and Latin authors. Grimm's results have been greatly modified by the wider range of comparison and improved <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> that now characterize linguistics, and many questions he raised will probably remain obscure (due to the enduring lack of attestation in the form of surviving records of these languages), but his book's influence has been profound.|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} his thesis, his interests {{moved to the}} perception of music. Soon after, he found the intriguing phenomenon of synesthesia on the crossroads of music and visual art. With artist and color expert Clara Froger, he started a series of experiments of synesthesia, combining scientific and artistic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b> The results were published nationally and internationally. The experiments became popular and got attention from hundreds of synesthetes in the Netherlands, mediated by articles and items in the Dutch media, {{which resulted in the}} Netherlands Web Community of Synesthesia and a number of workshops and conferences on synesthesia in art and science. The demand for information on synesthesia resulted in the book Tussen zinnen. The new perspective on synesthesia, developed in this book in collaboration with synesthetes, artists and scientists in the Netherlands, led to the publication of The Hidden Sense: Synesthesia in Art and Science by the MIT Press. [...] Since then, van Campen has been consulted on synesthesia and the senses in a number of national and international projects, among them , [...] Unilever UK and [...] Rabobank Netherlands. His research into synesthesia has taken the direction of autobiographical memory. In his latest book The Proust Effect, he explores tales and studies on sense memories (e.g. the Madeleine story by Marcel Proust).|$|E

60|$|Now, {{the worst}} of it is that the gentlemen in question, being {{unfamiliar}} with what is technically described as scientific <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> are very apt to lose their temper when thus cross-questioned, and to reply, after the fashion usually attributed to the female mind, with another question, whether the scientific person wishes to accuse them of downright lying. And as nothing on earth {{could be further from the}} scientific person's mind than such an imputation, he is usually fain in the end to give up the social pursuit of postprandial natural history (the subject generally crops up about the same time as the after-dinner coffee), and to let the prehistoric toad go on his own triumphant way, unheeded.|$|E
60|$|Among the watchers of {{the course}} of the world of thought, some view with delight and some with horror, the {{recrudescence}} of Supernaturalism which manifests itself among us, in shapes ranged along the whole flight of steps, which, in this case, separates the sublime from the ridiculous--from Neo-Catholicism and Inner-light mysticism, at the top, to unclean things, not worthy of mention in the same breath, at the bottom. In my poor opinion, the importance of these manifestations is often greatly over-estimated. The extant forms of Supernaturalism have deep roots in human nature, and will undoubtedly die hard; but, in these latter days, they have to cope with an enemy whose full strength is only just beginning to be put out, and whose forces, gathering strength year by year, are hemming them round on every side. This enemy is Science, in the acceptation of systematised natural knowledge, which, during the last two centuries, has extended those <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> the worth of which is confirmed by daily appeal to Nature, to every region in which the Supernatural has hitherto been recognised.|$|E
60|$|But {{great as}} these changes may be, they sink into insignificance beside the {{progress}} of physical science, whether we consider the improvement of <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> or the increase in bulk of solid knowledge.

6000|$|With a qualification, to be {{considered}} presently, {{the answer to this}} question is undoubtedly in the affirmative. The famous researches of Schwann and Schleiden in 1837 and the following years, founded the modern science of histology, or that branch of anatomy which deals with the ultimate visible structure of organisms, as revealed by the microscope; and, from that day to this, the rapid improvement of <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> and the energy of a host of accurate observers, have given greater and greater breadth and firmness to Schwann's great generalisation, that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals and plants; and that, however diverse may be the fabrics, or tissues, of which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result from the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed cells, in a more general sense than that in which the word [...] "cells" [...] was at first employed), which are not only similar in animals and in plants respectively, but present a close resemblance, when those of animals and those of plants are compared together.|$|E
60|$|In substance, {{whatever}} {{can be done}} in a {{work like}} this for the Logic of the Moral Sciences, has been or ought to have been accomplished in the five preceding Books; to which the present can be only a kind of supplement or appendix, since the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> applicable to moral and social science must have been already described, if I have succeeded in enumerating and characterizing those of science in general. It remains, however, to examine which of those methods are more especially suited to the various branches of moral inquiry; under what peculiar facilities or difficulties they are there employed; how far the unsatisfactory state of those inquiries is owing to a wrong choice of methods, how far to want of skill in the application of right ones; and what degree of ultimate success may be attained or hoped for by a better choice or more careful employment of logical processes appropriate to the case. In other words, whether moral sciences exist, or can exist; to what degree of perfection they are susceptible of being carried; and by what selection or adaptation of the methods brought to view in the previous part of this work that degree of perfection is attainable.|$|E
