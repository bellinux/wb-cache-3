40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{trends and}} possible future developments in global wood-product markets and discusses {{implications for the}} Swedish forest sector. Four possible futures, or scenarios, are considered, based on qualitative scenario analysis. The scenarios are distinguished principally by divergent futures with respect to two highly influential factors driving change in global wood-product markets, whose future development is unpredictable. These so-called critical uncertainties {{were found to be}} degrees to which: (i) current patterns of globalization will continue, or be replaced by regionalism, and (ii) concern about the environment, particularly climate change, related policy initiatives and customer preferences, will materialize. The overall future of the Swedish solid wood-product industry looks bright, irrespective of which of the four possible futures occurs, provided it accommodates the expected growth in demand for factory-made, energy-efficient construction components. The prospects for the pulp and paper industry in Sweden appear more ambiguous. Globalization is increasingly shifting production and consumption to the Southern hemisphere, adversely affecting employment and forest owners in Sweden. Further, technical progress in information and communication technology (ICT) is expected to lead to drastic reductions in demand for newsprint and printing paper. Chemical pulp producers may profit from a growing bio-energy industry, since they could manufacture new, high-value products in integrated bio-refineries. <b>Mechanical</b> pulp <b>producers</b> cannot do this, however, and might suffer from higher prices for raw materials and electricity. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{industry}} needs to implement several concurrent strategies. In particular, the industry {{can be expected}} to view recycling as a central part of its activities. These activities will be focused on the intense demand of chemical and biochemical strategies to enhance bonding within paper and paperboard. Nowadays, on average, 55 % of fibrous compositions for papermaking are made of recycled fibers. In this field, about 65 - 70 % are fibrous compositions intended to be used for packaging papermaking. Corrugated cardboard {{is one of the most}} significant examples, since it is made of fluting (internal part) and test liner (external part). In test liner mills, fibrous compositions are made of 50 % paper cuts from the cardboard industry and the rest of other types of paper and cardboard. Some test liner papers have low content of mineral fillers. While recycling, fibers get damaged due to the hornification phenomena and mechanical refining of the pulp (with the purpose of enhancing the <b>mechanical</b> properties). The <b>producer</b> does not have many alternatives to address this situation: to increase the quality of the pulp, to slightly refine the pulp or to add some chemical additives that enhance mechanical properties. One strategy or alternative to this situation could be biorefining processes of the pulp. The present work aims to biorefine a pulp made of recycled fibers with the purpose of restoring the mechanical properties of the industrial test liner or improving them and making possible the addition of mineral fillers in order to decrease the production costs. It was observed that, at best, the tensile strength improved by 55 % with regard to the original breaking length of the industrial test line...|$|R

According to Czech Statistical Office the total number of companies belonging to these 3 segments is 136. It means 16, 2 % companies belonging to CZ-NACE 27 participated in our research. Basic statistical methods were used to analyse the complete database. Scientific aim: The paper deals with the problem of service offering provided by today’s manufactur-ers. Global understanding of services that manufacturers really develop, sell, deliver and manage is still limited. Findings: Managing service offering provided by today‘s manufacturers shows that 1) Manufacturers not offer only tangible products, but also wide range of services and even information and support. 2) New products are not designed only according to company technicians, but also according to their cus-tomers. Their products and services are developed, tested and improved according to their needs. 3) Services provide complex customer care from time product selection to its end. Conclusions: Manufacturers of tangible products need to enlarge their product offering to be able to satisfy customers. Therefore companies often focus on customer services. Adding services to the products to extend the total offering through services are possible ways of acting to eroding product margins. Customer services are able to help to extend life cycles, develop long-term relationship that lock out competitors, increase revenue, etc...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the <b>producers.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for calcined coke by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying calcined coke qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the calcined coke feed materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of calcined coke. This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for calcined coke, HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four calcined coke types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma blade mixer together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the paste and mould showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust size and coke type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
