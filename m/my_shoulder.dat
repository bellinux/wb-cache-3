25|$|Another {{singer who}} {{influenced}} {{him at this}} time was falsetto crooner, Gene Austin. Laine worked after school at a drugstore that was situated {{across the street from}} a record store that continually played hit records by Gene Austin over their loudspeakers. He would swab down the windows in time to Austin's songs. Many years later, Laine related the story to Austin when both were guests on the popular television variety show Shower of Stars. He would also co-star in a film, Rainbow 'Round <b>My</b> <b>Shoulder,</b> with Austin's daughter, Charlotte.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Laine starred in over a half dozen {{backstage}} musicals, often playing himself; several of these were {{written and directed by}} a young Blake Edwards.

25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost {{confidence}} in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E

He had previously written and starred in the 2005 film The War Within, in which he portrayed a Pakistani engineering student who became a terrorist. He has studied at Brown University and Columbia University. He had also written the 2012 novel American Dervish, which studies [...] "the Muslim religious experience in America". The son of two foreign-born doctors, he had spent a decade exploring dual identity before writing this play. In order to write this play, Akhtar decided to write from his own experiences.

However, during test shots, the prop's tubing burst, causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff's forehead, rather than from her nose. Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character, Dana Scully, visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites. The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous, saying [...] "there really wasn't a reason for it. The bites could have been on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> or something."

Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again.

Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time now he has been peering over <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament.
