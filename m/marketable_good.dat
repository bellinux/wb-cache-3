40|$|Biodiversity {{is neither}} a <b>marketable</b> <b>good</b> or product, nor a service; it is the living web that connects the {{tangible}} and intangible elements of healthy ecosystems, which {{is the essence of}} so-called renewable natural capital. The maintenance of biodiversity is therefore not just an ecosystem service among many it is {{the sine qua non of}} ensuring a sustainable future. That is why the maintenance of biodiversity, partly through the augmentation, or restoration, of renewable natural capital, requires the full attention and action of policy-makers, practitioners, and scientists concerned with sustainability. This, in turn, requires a new approach to accounting and valuation of ecological restoration of damaged or degraded ecosystems. Here we seek to clarify the relation of biodiversity maintenance to ecosystem services, and to outline a new approach to the economic valuation of the restoration of renewable natural capital. A key element in this approach to economic valuation is the development and application of negative discount rates. Changing the way we think about the discount rate and, more broadly, the way we calculate costs and benefits related to restoration can contribute much to advance the maintenance of biodiversity...|$|E

Regardless {{the fact that}} there exist important differences among these models, in the majority of states there is competition among textbooks for the same subject. Nevertheless, the textbook is not a <b>marketable</b> <b>good</b> as any other: it is also a carrier of social and cultural values. Even more, in most cases, the decision which textbook to buy is not taken by the parent who pays for the textbook, but by the teacher who has no financial obligations in the whole process. As a result, textbook market is unperfect, and the majority of states regulates it more thoroughly than markets for other goods. Adoption processes {{are one of the most}} important keys for understanding the nature of such regulation. They are closely related to the nature of educational legislation: in the states with final-oriented legislation,the adoption processes are more common than in the states with process-oriented legislation.

Nevertheless, the state still adopts and evaluates textbook content,and is therefore more process than final oriented...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{the recent}} debate on {{austerity}} {{as a starting}} point, this paper discusses contradictions in current processes of neoliberalisation using the marketisation of elderly care in Switzerland as an example. Just as in other countries, an austerity rationality in public spending and the neoliberal restructuring of public health services {{paved the way for}} the emergence of private suppliers of 24 hours home care. These new agencies hire migrant women from Eastern European countries and sell packaged care services to the elderly. In so doing, they play a key role in reconfiguring care according to a market logic. They shape the working conditions of live-in migrant care workers and the definition of care itself as a <b>marketable</b> <b>good.</b> In our paper, we analyse the strategies of these new corporate intermediaries based on a market analysis and on interviews with their representatives. We argue that the marketisation of elderly care in Switzerland is illustrative of today’s neoliberalism in that it combines progressive and regressive aspects and owes its emergence to its ambiguous entanglement with many other discourses. The paper illustrates how the transformation of the home into a new space of commercialised care relies on the production and economic valorisation of social and mobility differentials...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} in land, also termed ‘land grabbing’, has increased significantly in developing countries. In response to growing concerns about its detrimental impacts, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank and other multilateral organizations have come forward with two proposals, namely the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (FAO 2012, FAO guidelines), to protect people's rights, and the Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment that Respects Rights, Livelihoods and Resources (FAO et al. 2010, RAI principles), to make such investments more responsible. One of their central tenets is that investors and host governments respect local people’s existing property rights over land by formalising them in a transparent and participatory manner. The article challenges the two proposals – and thus much of the recent land grab debate – from a legal pluralism perspective, by showing {{that they do not}} adequately consider the existence of plural legal orders over land and the dynamics of power and everyday practices inherent in property relations. Referring to empirical evidence from Tanzania, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan, we raise three fundamental concerns about the formalization of property rights. First, we demonstrate that the recognition of customary rights is a very complex and delicate endeavour, which risks neglecting existing property claims and rights. Neither of the proposals addresses this in a satisfactory way. Second, we understand that formalization by state intervention is sometimes necessary, but in those circumstances we cannot recommend the centralist approach of formalizing property rights, as proposed in the RAI principles. In many contexts, this approach has resulted in adverse effects for local communities rather than strengthening their rights. Third, a more rights-based vision as brought forward by the FAO guidelines still bears the risk of reinforcing unequal local power structures. Yet, this vision leaves it to local communities to decide whether their land should become a <b>marketable</b> <b>good</b> to outsiders or not. However, the introduction of such a property regime requires fundamental changes in governance. This cannot be addressed adequately within the framework of guidelines alone. Instead, more long-term strategies for the protection of customary rights are required. Thus, from an analytical perspective, a moratorium on ‘land grabs’ would be most appropriate. From a more pragmatic perspective though, we acknowledge the FAO guidelines and – to a much lesser extent – the RAI principles as more immediate efforts to reduce negative effects of 'land grabs'. However, investors and host governments should not mistake these guidelines as guarantors of ostensibly harmless land acquisitions. Finally, this article concludes that employing a legal pluralism perspective is very helpful in gaining a more holistic understanding of potential effects and proposed measures in the context of 'land grabs'...|$|E

Yields could be improved further, especially in intensive potato-growing regions where irrigation and fertilizing already contribute to a consistently high yield potential in the rather light soils. Different planting distances on individual soil plots were tested in the authors’ own trials.

Economic theory is based upon individual preferences (methodological individualism) : Ecological damages can only be socially evaluated when individual values are available.

Therefore, we have to use alternative evaluation methods to get economic values of ecological damages.

Additionally, current economic incentives encourage the development of funds of natural capital on private lands for marketable commodities at the expense of ecosystem services that benefit the public.
