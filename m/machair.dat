5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of <b>machair,</b> a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of <b>machair,</b> a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a <b>machair</b> landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machairs</b> have {{received}} considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly {{because of their}} unique ecosystems.|$|R
50|$|The flora of Scotland {{is typical}} of the {{northern}} European part of the Palearctic ecozone. Prominent features of Scotland's fauna include the boreal Caledonian Forest, heather moorland and coastal <b>machairs.</b> The forest once covered almost all of Scotland but now only 1% of the forest remains in 35 isolated areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{west coast}} of Scotland, in particular, is heavily {{indented}} and is scattered with fjordlike sea lochs. The east coast is more regular with series of large estuarine inlets, or firths, and long sandy beaches. Much of Scottish coastline consists of <b>machairs,</b> a dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided.|$|R
5|$|Berneray and Mingulay form an {{important}} breeding site for around {{a hundred thousand}} pairs of seabirds, and are especially important for the razorbill, the two islands having at least 2.0% of the UK's breeding population in 1985. Other species present include a variety of gulls, guillemots, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and (since 1899) fulmars. The island is largely covered by maritime grassland, with some <b>machair</b> and heath. Primrose, violets, yellow flag iris and celandine grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly seen by the landing cove. The island is designated as an SSSI and (with Mingulay) is a Special Protection Area.|$|E
5|$|Examination of peat cores and pollen records {{indicates}} that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) {{was taking place}} in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of arable cultivation exists. As the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage {{at the expense of}} woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A'Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker People, have been found in the <b>machair</b> which replaced it.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of <b>machair</b> habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E
50|$|Severe {{effects are}} likely to occur on biodiversity. Species {{of plants and animals}} that can't adapt quickly enough may become extinct or be {{replaced}} by other creatures. Coastal habitats, including <b>machairs,</b> may disappear due to high sea levels eroding the land. Salmon spawning beds may be wiped out by flash floods causing population problems for the species. There will be new risks to animals, plants and their habitats, including non-native pests and diseases.|$|R
5|$|The flora of Scotland is an {{assemblage}} of native plant species including over 1,600 vascular plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The total number of vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal <b>machair.</b> In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E
25|$|<b>Machair</b> - A Gaelic word {{referring}} to a grassy coastal plain, with typical flora, usually in the Outer Hebrides ('Links' in Lowland Scotland).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} habitats for this species of bee is the <b>machair</b> (coastal duneland) of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland where it was reported in September, 2007 that eleven previously unknown colonies had been discovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} colletes (Colletes floralis) is {{a species}} of bee within the genus Colletes. Northern colletes are solitary bees, though females may nest in what are termed aggregations – sites where the bees nest close together, but do not form colonies as social bees do. They nest underground in soft (often sandy) soil, digging burrows up to 20 times their body lengnth. It is often to be found nesting in coastal sand dunes and, on Hebridean islands, <b>machair</b> (coastal grassland).|$|E
25|$|A {{cross-section}} of Lewis would see mostly sandy beaches backed by dunes and <b>machair</b> on the Atlantic west coast, {{giving way to}} an expansive peat covered plateau in {{the centre of the}} island. The eastern coastline is markedly more rugged and is mostly rocky cliffs broken by small coves and beaches. The more fertile nature of the eastern side led to {{the majority of the population}} settling there, including the largest (and only) town, Stornoway. Aside from the village of Achmore in the centre of the island, all settlements are on the coast.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the western}} {{coastline}} of the islands is <b>machair,</b> a fertile low-lying dune pastureland. Lewis is comparatively flat, and largely consists of treeless moors of blanket peat. The highest eminence is Mealisval at [...] in the south west. Most of Harris is mountainous, with large areas of exposed rock and Clisham, the archipelago's only Corbett, reaches [...] in height. North and South Uist and Benbecula (sometimes collectively referred to as The Uists) have sandy beaches and wide cultivated areas of <b>machair</b> {{to the west and}} virtually uninhabited mountainous areas to the east. The highest peak here is Beinn Mhòr at [...] The Uists and their immediate outliers have a combined area of [...] This includes the Uists themselves and the islands linked to them by causeways and bridges. Barra is [...] in extent and has a rugged interior, surrounded by <b>machair</b> and extensive beaches.|$|E
500|$|The geology and {{geomorphology}} of {{the islands}} is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull, are mountainous, whilst others like Tiree are relatively low-lying. The highest mountains are the Cuillins of Skye, although peaks over [...] are common elsewhere. Much of the coastline is <b>machair,</b> a fertile low-lying dune pastureland. Many {{of the islands}} are swept by strong tides, and the Corryvreckan tide race between Scarba and Jura {{is one of the}} largest whirlpools in the world.|$|E
500|$|Its main {{habitat is}} high {{mountain}}s; {{it is found}} between [...] in North Africa, and mainly between [...] in the Himalayas. In that mountain range it reaches [...] in the summer, and has been recorded at [...] altitude on Mount Everest. In Ireland, Great Britain and Brittany it also breeds on coastal sea cliffs, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or <b>machair.</b> It was formerly more widespread on coasts but has suffered {{from the loss of}} its specialised habitat. It tends to breed at a lower elevation than the Alpine chough, that species having a diet better adapted to high altitudes.|$|E
500|$|The {{total number}} of {{vascular}} species is low by world standards, {{partly due to the}} effects of Pleistocene glaciations (which eliminated all or nearly all species) and the subsequent creation of the North Sea (which created a barrier to re-colonisation). Nonetheless, {{there are a variety of}} important species and assemblages. Heather moor containing Ling, Bell Heather, Cross-leaved Heath, Bog Myrtle and fescues is generally abundant and contains various smaller flowering species such as Cloudberry and Alpine Ladies-mantle. Cliffs and mountains host a diversity of [...] arctic and alpine plants including Alpine Pearlwort, Mossy Cyphal, Mountain Avens and Fir Clubmoss. On the Hebridean islands of the west coast, there are plantago pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include Red Fescue, Sea Plantain and Sea Pink. The <b>machair</b> landscapes include rare species such as Irish Lady's Tresses, Yellow Rattle and numerous orchids along with more common species such as Marram and Buttercup, Ragwort, Bird's-foot Trefoil and Ribwort Plantain. Scots Lovage, (Ligusticum scoticum) first recorded in 1684 by Robert Sibbald, and the Oyster Plant are common plants of the coasts.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>machair</b> {{is noted}} for {{different}} species of orchid and associated vegetation such as various grasses. Three heathers; ling, bell heather and cross-leaved heather are predominant in the large areas of moorland vegetation which also holds large numbers of insectivorous plants such as sundews. The expanse of heather-covered moorland explains the name Eilean an Fhraoich, Gaelic for [...] "The Heather Isle".|$|E
2500|$|Mainland Scotland has [...] of coastline. Including the {{numerous}} islands, this increases to some [...] The west coast {{in particular is}} heavily indented, with long promontories separated by fjordlike sea lochs. The east coast is more regular, {{with a series of}} large estuarine inlets, or firths, and long sandy beaches, for example at Aberdeen. [...] Much of the Scottish coastline consists of a <b>machair</b> formation, a dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} of Berneray is its <b>machair.</b> The <b>machair</b> is a coastal plain {{made up of}} windblown shell sand. Traditional crofting practice, which {{involves}} summer agriculture using seaweed together with dung from winter grazing animals as natural fertiliser, has, over time, bound together and stabilised the land. The <b>machair</b> is ploughed in rotation, giving a patchwork of crops and fallow of different ages which supports {{a wide range of}} flowers. Berneray has a particularly fine <b>machair,</b> a result of careful husbandry by the island’s crofters, helped by the absence of rabbits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machair</b> is {{distinguished}} from the links {{on the east coast}} of Scotland by a lower mineral content, whereas the links are high in silica. <b>Machair</b> plains are highly calcareous, with calcium carbonate concentrations of between 20% to 80% on the beaches, and decreasing further away from the shore. The pH of a <b>machair</b> is typically greater than 7, i.e. it is alkaline.|$|E
