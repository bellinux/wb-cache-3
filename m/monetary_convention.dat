500|$|The formal {{contract}} was dated October 29, signed by Spreckels as agent for Hawaii, and by San Francisco Mint Superintendent E. F. Burton. [...] It provided for $1,000,000 in coins: $500,000 in silver dollars, $300,000 in half dollars, $125,000 in quarter dollars and $75,000 in dimes. The Hawaiian government made {{the change from}} 12 cent pieces to dimes because it was negotiating a <b>monetary</b> <b>convention</b> with the United States and wanted its coins to conform to America's, though this convention never went into force. By mid-November the change had been noticed by the Mint, and Spreckels sent confirmation and a go-ahead to make dies for the dime, on the understanding that a revised authorization would be needed from Honolulu before production of dimes could begin. This was received in December. By this time, the kingdom's order was already in production, having started with a run of half dollars in November. Barber did not complete work on hubs for the dime until January 1884, and dies were not dispatched to San Francisco until February, though they are dated 1883. Once he had received the dies for the ten-cent coin, Burton sent the unneeded dies for the [...] 12 cent piece to the director's office in Washington.|$|E
50|$|The Maria Theresa thaler (MTT) is {{a silver}} bullion coin {{that has been}} used in world trade {{continuously}} since they were first minted in 1741, at that time using the then Reichsthaler standard of 9 thalers to the Vienna mark. In 1750 the thaler was debased to 10 thalers to the Vienna Mark (a weight approximating half a pound of fine silver). The following year the new standard was effectively adopted across the German-speaking world when that standard was accepted formally in the Bavarian <b>monetary</b> <b>convention.</b> It is owing to the date of the Bavarian <b>Monetary</b> <b>convention</b> that many writers erroneously state that the Maria Theresa Thaler was first struck in 1751. It was named after Empress Maria Theresa, who ruled Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia from 1740 to 1780. The word thaler gave rise to daalder and daler, which became dollar in English.|$|E
50|$|From {{early in}} his life Peabody was {{interested}} in Democratic Party politics. In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend Edward M. Shepard organize the Young Men's Democratic Club of Brooklyn, took {{a part in the}} 1892 presidential campaign on behalf of Grover Cleveland, supported the Gold Democrats against William Jennings Bryan in 1896, then switched to more moderate monetary reform {{as a member of the}} executive committee of the Indianapolis <b>Monetary</b> <b>Convention</b> in 1897. In 1904 and 1905 he served as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson's offer of a place on the Federal Trade Commission, Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. In June 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then Governor of New York, visited Peabody for advice and support in deciding to run for President of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{abundance}} of their coins {{would tend to}} suggest large mining operations, particularly in the mountainous area of the Hindu-Kush, and an important monetary economy. The Indo-Greek did strike bilingual coins both in the Greek [...] "round" [...] standard and in the Indian [...] "square" [...] standard, suggesting that monetary circulation extended to all parts of society. The adoption of Indo-Greek <b>monetary</b> <b>conventions</b> by neighbouring kingdoms, such as the Kunindas {{to the east and}} the Satavahanas to the south, would also suggest that Indo-Greek coins were used extensively for cross-border trade.|$|R
50|$|A {{regional}} {{variant of}} the florin was the Rheingulden, minted by several German states encompassing the commercial centers of the Rhein (Rhine) River valley, under a series of <b>monetary</b> <b>conventions</b> starting in 1354, initially at a standard practically identical to the Florentine florin (98% gold, 3.54 grams). By 1419, the weight had been slightly reduced (to 3.51 grams) and the alloy was substantially reduced (to 79% gold). By 1626, the alloy had been slightly reduced again (to 77% gold), while the weight was more substantially reduced (to 3.240 grams). In 1409, the Rheingulden standard (at the time 91.7% gold) was adopted for the Holy Roman Empire's Reichsgulden.|$|R

40|$|After having {{outlined}} {{the peculiarities of}} Vatican City State's nature, this paper examines the development of its financial law, starting with the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Convention</b> with European Union. The Holy See from 2009 makes a serious effort to adjust its law to the current needs of an increasingly globalised market. This results in a profound change in the Vatican international relations, which were previously mainly addressing Italy, {{in order to satisfy}} the territorial and material needs of a small State. Today Vatican City State has agreed to be subject to periodic controls on its financial system by international bodies. It has developed a system of international relations and it integrates into the global financial market transparency system...|$|E
40|$|The {{main reasons}} to mint 50 -para, 1 -, 2 -, and 5 -dinar silver coins, 3 -para nickel coins and 2 -para bronze coins in 1904 were: {{to mark the}} 100 -year anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising led by Karađorđe and the {{replacement}} of the House of Obrenović by the House of Karađorđević, and the expectations that the minting of small-denomination coins would bring profit to fill in the budget of the Serbian state finances. The Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia, together with its correspondent, the Hungarian Commercial Bank from Pest, was appointed the contractor/intermediary (between the Ministry of Finance and the minting house), and the following minting houses were selected: the Main Imperial Mint in Vienna and the Hungarian Royal Mint in Kremnica. The silver coins from this series had the features prescribed by the 1878 Law on the Serbian National Money, and in line with the provisions of the 1883 Paris <b>Monetary</b> <b>Convention.</b> 5 -dinar coins were minted in the Imperial Minting House in Vienna, and the remaining 50 -para, 1 - and 2 -dinar coins were minted in the Hungarian Royal Mint. These coins remained in circulation until 28 June 1931...|$|E
