40|$|A {{wide range}} of animals suffer from {{periodontal}} disease. However, {{there is very little}} reported on disease and oral micro-biota of Australian animals. Therefore, the oral cavity of 90 marsupials was examined for oral health status. Plaque samples were collected from the subgingival margins using curettes or swabs. Plaque samples were plated onto non-selective trypticase soy agar plates, selective trypticase soy agar, non-selective and selective Wilkens Chalgrens Agar. Plates were incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere and examined after 7 - 14 days for the presence of black-brown-pigmented colonies. A combination of morphological and biochemical tests were used (colonial morphology, pigmentation, aerobic growth, Gram reaction, fluorescence under long-wave UV light (360 nm), production of catalase, enzymatic activity with fluorogenic substrates and haemagglutination of sheep red cells) to identify these organisms. Black-pigmented bacteria were cultivated from the plaque of 32 animals including six eastern grey kangaroos, a musky rat kangaroo, a whiptail and a red-necked wallaby, 18 koalas, a bandicoot and five brushtail possums. No black-pigmented colonies were cultivated from squirrel or sugar gliders or quokkas or from <b>marsupial</b> <b>mice.</b> The majority of isolates were identified as Porphyromonas gingivalis-like species with the higher prevalence of isolation from the oral cavity of macropods (the kangaroos and wallabies). Oral diseases, such as gingivitis can be found in native Australian animals with older koalas having an increase in disease indicators and black-pigmented bacteria. Non-selective Wilkens Chalgren Agar was the medium of choice for the isolation of black-pigmented bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{understand}} {{the relative importance}} of ecological and historical factors in structuring terrestrial vertebrate assemblages across the A ustralian arid zone, and to contrast patterns of community phylogenetic structure at a continental scale. Location Australia. Methods We present evidence from six lineages of terrestrial vertebrates (five lizard clades and one clade of <b>marsupial</b> <b>mice)</b> that have diversified in arid and semi‐arid A ustralia across 37 biogeographical regions. Measures of within‐lineage community phylogenetic structure and species turnover were computed to examine how patterns differ across the continent and between taxonomic groups. These results were examined in relation to climatic and historical factors, which are thought {{to play a role in}} community phylogenetic structure. Analyses using a novel sliding‐window approach confirm the generality of processes structuring the assemblages of the A ustralian arid zone at different spatial scales. Results Phylogenetic structure differed greatly across taxonomic groups. Although these lineages have radiated within the same biome – the A ustralian arid zone – they exhibit markedly different community structure at the regional and local levels. Neither current climatic factors nor historical habitat stability resulted in a uniform response across communities. Rather, historical and biogeographical aspects of community composition (i. e. local lineage persistence and diversification histories) appeared to be more important in explaining the variation in phylogenetic structure. While arid‐zone assemblages show an overall tendency towards phylogenetic clustering, this pattern was less pronounced at finer spatial scales. Main conclusions By focusing within different taxonomic groups and between those groups within regions, we show that although the vertebrate lineages we examined exhibited high diversity and low turnover across the arid zone, the underlying phylogenetic structure differs between regions and taxonomic groups, suggesting that taxon‐specific histories are more important than habitat stability in determining patterns of phylogenetic community relatedness...|$|E

The largest known outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) since its discovery in 1993 occurred in western Paraguay in December 1995. Here I identify the small mammal carriers of this newly discovered hantavirus and describe the population biology and habitat use of the primary rodent reservoir. This is the first quantitative study of habitat use by small mammals in the central Paraguayan chaco. Communities of small mammals were sampled at multiple spatial scales in four common habitats (cropland, pasture, thorn scrub, and dry forest) to examine both macrohabitat and microhabitat use. Most species of small mammals utilized more than one habitat type, although Bolomys lenguarum and Holochilus brasiliensis appeared to be strongly associated with pasture habitats. Oligoryzomys chacoensis and species of <b>marsupial</b> <b>mice</b> were strongly associated with wooded habitats. Microhabitat analysis of small mammal species revealed their separation along two primary environmental gradients: increasing trees and shrubs and increasing herbaceous ground cover. Species such as Calomys laucha and Andalgalomys pearsoni were associated with low herbaceous ground cover and few trees and shrubs, whereas others (e. g., Oligoryzomys chacoensis) were associated with higher herbaceous ground cover and many trees and shrubs. Calomys laucha was the only small mammal species to test positive for antibodies against hantavirus, confirming it as the primary reservoir in the region. C. laucha was captured at relatively high densities in all habitats except dry forest, and its population densities were highest during the dry season months of April through August. Seroprevalence was highest in cropland habitats and relatively low in pasture habitats. I hypothesize that seroprevalence is higher in habitats where the primary reservoir represents a high proportion of the total rodent fauna. To reduce human risk of infection with HPS, I recommend that houses be sealed against rodents prior to major agricultural activity such as plowing, or that crop fields be located away from houses and outbuildings...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} expressed sequence tags, ESTs, for establishing divergences within the tree of placental mammals. This is done on {{the example of the}} established relationships among primates (human), lagomorphs (rabbit), rodents (rat and mouse), artiodactyls (cow), carnivorans (dog) and proboscideans (elephant). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have produced 2000 ESTs (1. 2 mega bases) from a <b>marsupial</b> <b>mouse</b> and characterized the data for their use in phylogenetic analysis. The sequences were used to identify putative orthologous sequences from whole genome projects. Although most ESTs stem from single sequence reads, the frequency of potential sequencing errors was found to be lower than allelic variation. Most of the sequences represented slowly evolving housekeeping-type genes, with an average amino acid distance of 6. 6 % between human and mouse. Positive Darwinian selection was identified at only a few single sites. Phylogenetic analyses of the EST data yielded trees that were consistent with those established from whole genome projects. CONCLUSIONS: The general quality of EST sequences and the general absence of positive selection in these sequences make ESTs an attractive tool for phylogenetic analysis. The EST approach allows, at reasonable costs, a fast extension of data sampling from species outside the genome projects...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2003 Elsevier ScienceComparative genomic {{sequence}} analysis {{is a powerful}} technique for identifying regulatory regions in genomic DNA. However, its utility largely depends on the evolutionary distances between the species involved. Here we describe the screening of a genomic BAC library from the stripe-faced dunnart, Sminthopsis macroura, {{formerly known as the}} narrow-footed <b>marsupial</b> <b>mouse.</b> We isolated a clone containing the LYL 1 locus, completely sequenced the 60. 6 -kb insert, and compared it with orthologous human and mouse sequences. Noncoding homology was substantially reduced in the human/dunnart analysis compared with human/mouse, yet we could readily identify all promoters and exons. Human/mouse/dunnart alignments of the LYL 1 candidate promoter allowed us to identify putative transcription factor binding sites, revealing a pattern highly reminiscent of critical regulatory regions of the LYL 1 paralogue, SCL. This newly identified LYL 1 promoter showed strong activity in myeloid progenitor cells and was bound in vivo by Fli 1, Elf 1, and Gata 2 -transcription factors all previously shown to bind to the SCL stem cell enhancer. This study represents the first large-scale comparative analysis involving marsupial {{genomic sequence}} and demonstrates that such comparisons provide a powerful approach to characterizing mammalian regulatory elements.

40|$|The vomeronasal system {{consists}} of a peripheral organ and the connected central neuronal networks. The central connections are sexually dimorphic in rodents, and in some species, parameters of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) vary with sex, hormonal exposure, body size and seasonality. The VNO of the dasyurid <b>marsupial</b> <b>mouse,</b> Antechinus subtropicus is presumed to be functional. The unusual life history (male semelparity) is marked by distinct seasonality with differences in hormonal environments both between males and females, and in males at different time points. Body size parameters (e. g., length, weight) display sexual dimorphism and, in males, a pronounced weight gain before breeding {{is followed by a}} rapid decline during the single, short reproductive season. VNO morphometry was investigated in male and female A. subtropicus to identify possible life cycle associated activity. The overall length of the VNO is positively correlated with the size of the animal. The amount of sensory epithelium exhibits a negative correlation, decreasing with increasing size of the animal. The effects of sex and breeding condition are not obvious, although they do suggest that sensory vomeronasal epithelium mass declines in the breeding period. The VNO may be more important in A. subtropicus before breeding when it may participate in synchronising reproduction and {{in the development of the}} male stress response. J.

50|$|Mimosa pigra is a noxious weed, {{which has}} {{received}} international recognition {{because of its}} existing and potential impact on biological diversity. In Australia it further affects traditional and non-traditional land use, and the sustainability of agriculture and tourism. Currently, Mimosa pigra has replaced over 80,000 hectares of native vegetation on wetlands in northern Australia. It was further found that Mimosa pigra thickets had fewer birds and lizards, less herbaceous vegetation, and fewer tree seedlings than the native vegetation. Furthermore, it is also probable that the magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata (Latham)) is endangered by the spread of this weed, since it needs dense stands of native sedges for nesting and food. Conversely, the rare <b>marsupial</b> <b>mouse</b> Sminthopsis virginiae (Tarragon) had become more abundant {{as a result of}} Mimosa pigra. It is probable that other species have been affected as well. Traditional methods of food-gathering by Aborigines are threatened by the weed through its effects on the fauna and flora of the wetlands, which are otherwise rich in traditional food such as fish, turtles and water birds. Sacred sites and sites of cultural significance have also been affected.The dense thickets, by competing with pastures, hindering mustering, and preventing access to water, are a threat to pastoral industries, particularly the buffalo industry, in Australia.Hence, Mimosa pigra affects the pastoral industry through reduced grazing and water resources and increased difficulties in stock management, infrastructure maintenance and feral animal control.Tourism is also affected through reduced area and access for tourism activities, reduced wildlife attractions and reduced access to fishing, hunting and scenic areas.|$|R
40|$|Placental {{formation}} and genomic imprinting are two important features of embryonic development in placental mammals. Genetic {{studies have demonstrated}} that imprinted genes play a prominent role in regulating placental formation. In <b>marsupials,</b> <b>mice</b> and humans, the paternally derived X chromosome is preferentially inactivated in the placental tissues of female embryos. This special form of genomic imprinting may have evolved under the same selective forces as autosomal imprinted genes. This chromosomal imprinting phenomenon predicts the existence of maternally expressed X-linked genes that regulate placental development. ^ In this study, an X-linked homeobox gene, designated Esx 1 has been isolated. During embryogenesis, Esx 1 was expressed in a subset of placental tissues and regulates formation of the chorioallantoic placenta. Esx 1 acted as an imprinted gene. Heterozygous female mice that inherit an Esx 1 -null allele from their father developed normally. However, heterozygous females that inherit the Esx 1 mutation from their mother were born 20 % smaller than normal and had an identical phenotype to hemizygous mutant males and homozygous mutant females. Surprisingly, although Esx 1 mutant embryos were initially comparable in size to wild-type controls at 13. 5 days post coitum (E 13. 5) their placentas were significantly larger (51 % heavier than controls). Defects in the morphogenesis of the labyrinthine layer were observed as early as E 11. 5. Subsequently, vascularization abnormalities developed at the maternal-fetal interface, causing fetal growth retardation. These results identify Esx 1 as the first essential X-chromosome-imprinted regulator of placental development that influences fetal growth and may have important implications in understanding human placental insufficiency syndromes such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the Mammalia {{have been studied}} at various levels. Different sources of genetic information have been evaluated and used as phylogenetic markers. These include the well-known mitochondrial genome, cDNA from housekeeping genes and expressed sequence tags from nuclear genes. Applying RT-PCR on mRNA from nuclear genes is a new approach for collecting nuclear gene data for studying the phylogeny of Placentalia. The sequence analysis of eight housekeeping genes found Glires as sister group to the remaining Placentalia. The evaluation of previously suggested phylogenetic hypotheses requires large amounts of data that cannot be collected from individually selected genes. Whole genome sequencing projects have made the sequence data from numerous placental mammals available. The data from an appropriate outgroup to root the placental mammal tree was initially missing. Therefore expressed sequence tag from a <b>marsupial</b> <b>mouse</b> was made. This increased the amount of sequence data for phylogenetic analysis a hundredfold compared to methods that select individual genes. Phylogenetic analysis recovered a monophyletic Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria, thus contradicting {{the results from the}} housekeeping gene dataset. Mammalia contains three subgroups: Prototheria, Metatheria and Eutheria. The analysis of genomic and EST sequence data supported a sister group relationship between Eutheria and Metatheria in accordance with the Theria hypothesis. Molecular estimates of their divergence times suggest a basal divergence of Theria at ? 138 MYA and the basal divergences of Mammalia was estimated to 167 ? 178 MYA. Mitogenomics has been used to study divergences of Caniformia, the dog like carnivores. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a basal divergence between dogs and the remaining caniforms. Within the caniforms, seals and musteloids are sister taxa. Molecular evidence clearly identifies the giant panda as belonging to the bear lineage.
