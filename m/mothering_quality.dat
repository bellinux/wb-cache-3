50|$|About 30 {{percent of}} human conceptions do not {{progress}} to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies) and {{this creates a}} second arena for conflict between {{the mother and the}} fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for spontaneous abortion than the <b>mother.</b> The <b>mother's</b> <b>quality</b> cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone progesterone, but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal human chorionic gonadotrophin released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in hypertension and, significantly, high birth weight is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.|$|R

40|$|Phenotypic quality, such as {{condition}} or size, often varies between individuals. For species with extensive maternal care, {{the quality of}} offspring may partially {{be determined by the}} <b>quality</b> of their <b>mother.</b> Trivers and Willard (1973) predicted that high quality females should prefer offspring of the sex whose reproductive success is most strongly influenced by maternal care, which in many cases will be sons. Correspondingly, low quality females should prefer daughters. However, this prediction is not based on a proper analysis of variation in reproductive value. Using state-dependent life-history theory, I show here that high quality females should prefer offspring of the sex whose reproductive value is most strongly influenced by maternal care. I also show that when offspring quality is strongly determined by their <b>mother's</b> <b>quality,</b> but not influenced by their father's quality, high quality females can have higher reproductive value than high quality males, even though their reproductive success may be much lower.

The study used the Attachment Questionnaire to the Father and Mother (Matos & Costa, 2004), the Inventory of Parental and Peer Attachment (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) and also the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965).

Poorly controlled sinonasal disease may have significant adverse effects on the <b>mother’s</b> <b>quality</b> of life and pregnancy outcomes and the lack of adequately controlled safety data limits the clinician’s ability to make informed decisions about management. At the conclusion of this discussion, the reader should be familiar with the available literature and evidence-based guidelines regarding the safety and indications for radiographic imaging, clinical testing, medical intervention, and surgical treatment of sinonasal disease in pregnant patients. A review was performed of pertinent guidelines regarding the management of gestational rhinitis, sinusitis, and epistaxis, including the diagnostic and therapeutic limitations and physi-ological changes specific to pregnancy. A study population of four patients was analyzed to highlight the steps of management by reviewing the patient charts including pertinent history, physical examination, clinical course, and operative reports. Two patients with epistaxis and two patients with rhinosinusitis ranging from 27 to 38 years of age and between 16 and 35 weeks gestation were analyzed. The treatment of sinonasal disease during pregnancy is challenging and a thorough knowledge of the available medical evidence and treatment guidelines is necessary to optimize pregnancy outcomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maternal {{postpartum}} distress {{is often}} {{construed as a}} marker of vulnerability to poor parenting. Less is known, however, {{about the impact of}} postpartum distress on parenting an infant born prematurely. The present study investigated whether high distress levels, which are particularly prevalent in mothers of preterm born infants, necessarily affect a <b>mother's</b> <b>quality</b> of parenting. METHOD: Latent Class Analysis was used to group mothers (N= 197) of term, moderately, and very preterm born infants, based on their levels of distress (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) at one month postpartum, and their quality of parenting at one and six months postpartum. Parenting quality was assessed on the basis of maternal interactive behaviors (sensitivity, intrusiveness, and withdrawal) using observations, and maternal attachment representations (balanced, disengaged, or distorted) using interviews. RESULTS: A 5 -Class model yielded the best fit to the data. The first Class (47 %) of mothers was characterized by low distress levels and high-quality parenting, the second Class (20 %) by low distress levels and low-quality parenting, the third Class (22 %) by high distress levels and medium-quality parenting, the fourth Class (9 %) by high distress levels and high-quality parenting, and finally the fifth Class (2 %) by extremely high levels of distress and low-quality parenting. CONCLUSIONS: While heightened distress levels seem inherent to preterm birth, there appears to be substantial heterogeneity in mothers' emotional responsivity. This study indicates that relatively high levels of distress after preterm birth do not necessarily place these mothers at increased risk with regard to poor parenting. Conversely, low distress levels do not necessarily indicate good-quality parenting. The {{results of the present study}} prompt a reconsideration of the association between postpartum distress and parenting quality, and challenge the notion that high levels of maternal distress always result in low-quality parenting practice...|$|R

Variables measured at age 10 – 12 were investigated as predictors of an all-source measure of violence between ages 13 and 19. Results A number of individual (e. g., low hyperactivity, low psychopathic features) family (good supervision, low parental stress), school (high academic achievement, positive attitude to school) and demographic characteristics (older <b>mother,</b> good <b>quality</b> housing) were found to be risk-based protective factors for the various risk groups identified. High academic achievement was consistently found to be an interactive protective factor and was consistently independently related to low levels of violence.

Also, interventions should be tailored to include knowledge about these protective factors in light of the specific risks that individuals possess...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{on the influence of}} alternative care in the mother-child attachment. We study the controversial findings that do not allow the kind of influence of assistance to Child Care Centers {{in the first year of}} life. We review research from 1978 to 2008 on alternative care early and their effect on infant attachment patterns. We review the studies referred mainly to out-of-home care in specialized centers. It develops the definition of alternative care, the importance of adherence and the role of caregivers as a secure base. We review research that focuses on the amount of time in which children are cared for by someone other than the <b>mother,</b> the <b>quality</b> of care and the variables associated with the family and social context. This allows a more comprehensive and complex the effect of alternative care in the development of infant attachment patterns. It discusses the various findings and highlights those of consistency that could contribute to understanding the discussion of the effect of child care centers and their relation to patterns of infant attachment. </p...|$|R
