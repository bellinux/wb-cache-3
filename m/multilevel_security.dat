This paper intro-duces the Multilevel Allocation Problem (MAP), which models the screening of passen-gers and baggage in a <b>multilevel</b> aviation <b>security</b> system. A passenger is screened by one of several classes, each of which corresponds to a set of procedures using security screen-ing devices, where passengers are differentiated by their perceived risk levels. Each class is defined in terms of its fixed cost (the overhead costs), its marginal cost (the additional cost to screen a passenger), and its security level. The objective of MAP is to assign each passenger to a class such that the total security is maximized subject to passenger as-signments and budget constraints. This paper shows that MAP is NP-hard, introduces two dynamic programming algorithms for solving MAP in pseudo-polynomial time, and introduces a Greedy heuristic that obtains approximate solutions to MAP that use no more than two classes. Examples are constructed using data extracted from the Official Airline Guide (OAG). Analysis of the examples suggests that fewer security classes for passenger screening may be more effective and that using passenger risk information can lead to more effective security screening strategies...|$|R

Hence the database operations performed on the multi-level views are decomposed into a set of operations on the single-level objects which can be implemented on any conventional mandatory security kernel. We show that this approach allows us to overcome the difficulties of handling content and context dependent classification, dynamic classification, and aggregation and inference problems in multi-level object-oriented databases.

40|$|Abstract — Network {{processors}} (NPs), {{a type of}} multicore, multithread {{system that}} exploits system-on-chip techniques, usually adopt a distributed, shared memory hierarchy to scale up network processing. Network applications running on NP often display distinct characteristics on memory subsystem compared with traditional processors with <b>multilevel</b> cache. As <b>security,</b> especially cryptography, has become indispensable in today’s networks, we present a benchmark suite called NPCryptBench. It is the first benchmark specially designed to evaluate cryptographic performance on NPs, particularly that of processor and memory subsystem. By running NPCryptBench on Intel IXP network processors, we provide quantitative evidence that performance bottlenecks under such a highly parallel environment reside in memory hierarchy and prolonged access latency, instead of limited computing resources described in recent literature. To alleviate this memory-wall effect, we suggest several software optimizations, which averagely boost the benchmark throughput by 145 % on Intel IXP 2800. Our analysis and optimizations are also suitable for other NPs with similar architectures...|$|R

50|$|<b>Multilevel</b> <b>security</b> or {{multiple}} levels of security (MLS) is {{the application of}} a computer system to process information with incompatible classifications (i.e., at different security levels), permit access by users with different security clearances and needs-to-know, and prevent users from obtaining access to information for which they lack authorization. There are two contexts for the use of <b>Multilevel</b> <b>Security.</b> One is to refer to a system that is adequate to protect itself from subversion and has robust mechanisms to separate information domains, that is, trustworthy. Another context is to refer to an application of a computer that will require the computer to be strong enough to protect itself from subversion and possess adequate mechanisms to separate information domains, that is, a system we must trust. This distinction is important because systems that need to be trusted are not necessarily trustworthy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} how to combine a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB) with polyinstantiated and slightly augmented Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software programs in separate Single Level Secure (SLS) partitions to create Multi Level Secure (MLS) applications. These MLS applications can coordinate fine grained (intra-document) Bell LaPadula (BLP) [6] separation between information at multiple security levels. The untrusted COTS {{programs in the}} SLS partitions send at-level file edits as diff transactions to the TCB. The TCB verifies that BLP semantics will be observed and then patches these transactions into its canonical representation of the file. Finally, it releases appropriately filtered versions back to each SLS partition for re-assembly into the COTS program’s standard file format. Furthermore, by judiciously restricting how the user can interact with the system the multiple SLS instantiations of the COTS program {{can be made to}} appear as if they are a single MLS instantiation. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using Microsoft Word and DokuWiki.

40|$|With {{the pervasiveness}} of smart phones and the advance of Mobile Internet, more and more Mobile Internet {{services}} migrated to the cloud service platform for better user experience. As {{one of the most}} indispensable components of the cloud computing infrastructure, virtualization technology has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of virtualization still faces many challenges in information security. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called <b>multilevel</b> and grouping <b>security</b> model for virtualization (V-MGSM), for the security of resources in cloud computing platform. Specifically, to fulfill the balance between information sharing and privacy preservation, the virtual machines (VMs) are divided into diverse groups based on their corresponding entities, and each VM in the same group is assigned to different security level according to security requirements. Besides, the operation between VMs is based on mandatory access control mechanism. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed V-MGSM can provide a secure communication mechanism for VMs and implement the synchronous updates of the borrowed data. Ultimately, we implement V-MGSM in Xen for experiments, and the results demonstrate that V-MGSM can indeed achieve data security and privacy protection efficiently for Mobile Internet service...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{explosion}} in the complexity and amount of digital multimedia data, {{there has been a}} huge impact on the operations of various organizations in distinct areas, such as government services, education, medical care, business, entertainment, etc. To satisfy the growing demand of multimedia data management systems, an integrated framework called DIMUSE is proposed and deployed for distributed multimedia applications to offer a full scope of multimedia related tools and provide appealing experiences for the users. ^ This research mainly focuses on video database modeling and retrieval by addressing a set of core challenges. First, a comprehensive multimedia database modeling mechanism called Hierarchical Markov Model Mediator (HMMM) is proposed to model high dimensional media data including video objects, low-level visual/audio features, as well as historical access patterns and frequencies. The associated retrieval and ranking algorithms are designed to support not only the general queries, but also the complicated temporal event pattern queries. Second, system training and learning methodologies are incorporated such that user interests are mined efficiently to improve the retrieval performance. Third, video clustering techniques are proposed to continuously increase the searching speed and accuracy by architecting a more efficient multimedia database structure. A distributed video management and retrieval system is designed and implemented to demonstrate the overall performance. The proposed approach is further customized for a mobile-based video retrieval system to solve the perception subjectivity issue by considering individual user 2 ̆ 7 s profile. Moreover, to deal with security and privacy issues and concerns in distributed multimedia applications, DIMUSE also incorporates a practical framework called SMARXO, which supports <b>multilevel</b> multimedia <b>security</b> control. SMARXO efficiently combines role-based access control (RBAC), XML and object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) to achieve the target of proficient security control. ^ A distributed multimedia management system named DMMManager (Distributed MultiMedia Manager) is developed with the proposed framework DEMUR; to support multimedia capturing, analysis, retrieval, authoring and presentation in one single framework. ...|$|R
