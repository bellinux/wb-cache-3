40|$|Folate is an {{important}} B vitamin in the daily diet. It is not known to what extent naturally occurring folates in the mixed diet is bioavailable. Knowledge on {{to what extent the}} natural folates are absorbed would be best studied in a population that is not exposed to any folate fortificant. The aim {{of the present study was}} to study the bioavailability of dietary 5 -methyl tetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF) in a whole day&# 146;s mixed diet relative to supplemental 5 -MTHF in a selected Indian population. A dietary survey (n= 200) conducted in South India, revealed a mean total intake of folate of 277 + 92. 3 &# 956;g/day (which is nearly 3 times higher than the current Indian Recommended Dietary Intake set to 100 &# 956;g/day) based on the actual analysis of foods collected from a typical diet using a trienzyme technique followed by the microbiological assay. Further, the individual folate forms present in the foods were also analysed using a newly developed Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry LC-MS/MS). Quantification of folates was performed using internal standards. Good linearity was observed between 2 - 100 ng/Injection (Injection volume- 100 &# 956;L, R 2 : 0. 98) that was suitable for analysis of foods (cereal, pulse, vegetables, <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> <b>preparations</b> and fruit) and blood samples (serum folate and erythrocyte folate) for use in bioavailability study. The folate intakes were reported to be higher (429 + 68. 7 &# 956;g/day) when the individual foods from the diet were analysed using the LC-MS/MS technique when compared to the values generated using microbiological assay. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the Indian diets were predominant in 5 -MTHF and the important sources being cereals, pulses and vegetables. 22 human volunteers, aged 18 - 25 years were recruited in India to study the bioavailability of 5 -MTHF. A randomized trial (12 weeks) was designed, where the subjects consumed 400 g 5 -MTHF/day in the form of as supplemental drink or an experimental diet (400 g/day) consisting predominantly 5 -MTHF (90 %). Relative bioavailability of 5 -MTHF was calculated by comparing the responses to food folate in relation to supplemental 5 -MTHF, as indicated by the biomarkers. The relative bioavailability of food folate predominant in 5 -MTHF was 41 % based on serum folate indicator and 47 % based on erythrocyte folate status. A mean increase of 60 % was observed in the erythrocyte folate levels of the subjects consuming diets predominant in 5 -MTHF in 12 weeks. Diets predominant in 5 -MTHF have a good potential in improving the folate status of the population...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to study the {{efficiency}} of the diet therapy against atopic dermatitis by means of the goat's <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products among children at different age. The researchers observed 188 children aged between 3 months and 18 years, suffering from atopic dermatitis aggravated by the mycotic infection. Patients of the main group (102 children under 3) received goat's <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products within the hypo allergic diet — «Nanny» and «Nanny — Zolotaya Kozochka» adapted milk formulas, while children over 3 received «Amal Tea» instant goat's milk. The research findings have showed that the introduction of the goat's <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products into the food ration leads not only to the positive short term results — achievement of the clinical remission on 12 th– 20 th day from the moment the therapy starts, but also to the positive long term effect — remission extension, reduction of the disease recurrences, reduction of the general IgE level in blood serum and offending IgE allergens to the cow milk proteins and casein. Thus, the replacement of the cow <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products within the ration of patients for «Nanny» and «Nanny — Zolotaya Kozochka» adapted milk formulas and «Amal Tea» instant goat's milk allows for optimization of the atopic dermatitis diet therapy among children at different age.

40|$|A {{follow up}} of {{a cohort of}} 736 healthy full term {{children}} with exposure to cows' <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> formula and breast milk from donors on the maternity ward was performed. The children were divided into three exposure groups according to the feeding patterns on the maternity ward. Group 1 received only mother's milk, group 2 mother's milk and human donors' milk, and group 3 received mother's milk, donors' milk and cows' <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> formula. The children were investigated at 7 years of age, by examining their medical files, and at 11 and 14 years, by questionnaires regarding symptoms of atopic disease. No {{significant differences between the}} three groups at follow up were found in the cumulative incidences of atopic diseases. The amount of formula given did not affect the risk of developing atopic disease. Children with a family history of such diseases ran the same risk of subsequent atopic disease whether they were fed formula or breast milk alone.

40|$|Seven {{stabilizers}} {{were assessed}} for their suitability and compatibility to peanut <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> set yoghurt. For {{the sake of}} screening, the concentration of the stabilizers added was fixed at 0. 2 % (w/v). Peanut <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> yoghurt was prepared from a mixture of 60 % peanut milk and 40 % cow milk. Whey separation, gel firmness and sensory quality of the yoghurt were the quality attributes used for screening the stabilizers. Yoghurt containing κ-carrageenan and gelatin had a firm gel {{with little or no}} whey at the top, respectively. Yoghurt containing the other five stabilizers (High methoxy pectin, Propylene glycole alginate, Carboxy methyl cellulose, Xanthan gum and Guar gum) all formed weak gels with little or excessive whey at the top. The yoghurt containing gelatin had higher sensory scores for all the three sensory attributes (Appearance, texture and overall acceptability) as compared to the other stabilizers assessed in this study. Therefore, gelatin was found to be the most appropriate stabilizer compatible to a peanut <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> yoghurt system...|$|R

This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, “schnapps”, palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water <b>base</b> <b>preparations</b> recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159. 5 × 105 cfu/ml and 217. 4 × 102 cfu/ml in water and alcohol <b>base</b> <b>preparations</b> respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps <b>base</b> <b>preparations</b> were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water <b>base</b> <b>preparations</b> had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157 H 7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O 157 H 7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sialic acids are acidic sugars with a 9 -carbon backbone, {{expressed}} as terminal residue on mammalian glycoconjugates. Sialic acid {{was found in}} two forms as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Ac) and N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Gc) in meat and milk products. Neu 5 Ac {{is important for the}} brain and neuro development while Neu 5 Gc is suspected as human carcinogen. There is no data reported on sialic acid content in Indian <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products. Objective: To determine sialic acid (Neu 5 Ac and Neu 5 Gc) content in Indian milk and milk products and thermal stability of non-human sialic acid (Neu 5 Gc) evaluation. Design: Milk products like chocolate, infant food products, <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> energy drinks, butter etc were examined for the sialic acid content. For Neu 5 Gc thermal stability studies cow, buffalo, cross cows and processed milk were used. Conclusion: The study indicates the level of sialic acid (Neu 5 Ac and Neu 5 Gc) in Indian <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>based</b> products. Further the stability studies shows degradation (20 to 22 %) of non-human sialic acid (Neu 5 Gc) to the total sialic acid content...|$|R
