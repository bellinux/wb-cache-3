25|$|Mobile UDDTs are {{typically}} either fabricated of new materials {{in a factory}} or workshop using a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf parts—and then sold to the public either directly or via distributors or retail outlets; or fabricated at home out of wood, using new and re-purposed parts and materials.

One advantage {{of this type of}} UDDT is that they are portable, making them an interesting option for remote or temporary installations and for installations aboard moving vehicles or non-stationary residences such as boats, recreational-vehicles (i.e. caravan, camper van, <b>motor</b> <b>home)</b> and tiny-houses.|$|E
