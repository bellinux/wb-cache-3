25|$|The biface leafpoint {{tools of}} central Europe are called blattspitzen. They are {{projectile}} points {{belonging to the}} Middle Palaeolithic with a leaf-shaped form. They are often dual pointed and flat, making them similar to Solutrean laurel leaf blades. It is possible to distinguish the two only from their archaeological context. Blattspitzen survived in some Upper Palaeolithic cultures. The pieces from the eastern European Szeletien culture (both blattspitzen and <b>Micoquian</b> bifaces) could be the link that connects the tradition of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic bifacial objects with those from the Upper Palaeolithic and beyond.|$|E

The refits and their interpretations {{presented in this}} paper reflect some very important aspects of bifacial tool technology in the Crimean <b>Micoquian.</b> It appears that in the frame of the <b>Micoquian</b> techno-complex the technological approaches to raw material reduction were very variable. Aside from the well-known and characteristic plano-convex bifacials, <b>Micoquian</b> knappers were able to produce bifacial preforms with a bi-convex cross-section. On the other hand, {{there is no evidence of}} bi-convex retouching in the Crimean Micoquian; in spite of bi-convex preform shaping, tool retouching was undertaken using the typical plano-convex manner...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{different}} bifacial elements {{that occur in the}} last glacial cycle it is established that at least three technocomplexes can be distinguished in continental northwestern Europe: Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (small, symmetric, cordiform and triangular handaxes), <b>Micoquian</b> or Keilmessergruppe (asymmetric bifacial elements, often with backing and noncovering retouched) and a leaf point industry. Moreover, the analyses show that some lithic assemblages in continental northwestern Europe do not fit into this current framework of Middle Palaeolithic industries. More specifically assemblages that contain a contemporary presence of <b>Micoquian</b> and Mousterian bifacial elements occur regularly, leaving a typological dilemma to assign them to one of these two technocomplexes. This leads to the question: do <b>Micoquian</b> and Mousterian industries represent behaviourally discrete entities and how do ‘mixed’ assemblages fit into this? After exploring the techno-typological characteristics of these ‘mixed’ assemblages, possible reasons for the variability in bifacial elements and the causes for the occurrence of mixed assemblages, including the relationship between the <b>Micoquian</b> and Mousterian, are presented. Interpreting this phenomenon is preliminary since the evidence is coarse-grained due to many old excavations and a lack of chronostratigraphic information. Most likely the mixed occurrences can be explained in relation to population migrations caused by climate change...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{excavations}} in Ciemna Cave in the Prądnik valley near Ojców, southern Poland {{have brought}} to light new stratigraphic and techno-typological evidence concerning Late Middle Palaeolithic groups and their cultural affinities. In 2007, excavations began in the hitherto-unexplored main chamber of Ciemna Cave, {{with the goal of}} clarifying the results of previous work {{in other parts of the}} cave. During excavation the rocky floor of the cave was reached. About 1000 stone artifacts have been collected to date. Three cultural traditions have been documented: Mousterian, Taubachian, and <b>Micoquian.</b> Within the <b>Micoquian</b> tradition, three cultural levels were observed, which enriches the previous understanding of occupational phases at the site. These findings permit revision of the traditional terms “Prądnik industry” and “Prądnik technique...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe German Middle Paleolithic {{is marked}} by two stages with {{abundant}} archaeological sites: The Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5 e) and the Weichselian Interpleniglacial (MIS 3). On the other hand, several stages were seemingly void of any human population (the second half of MIS 6 and MIS 4) and two long periods (MIS 8 - 6 and MIS 5 d- 5 a) delivered very few archaeological sites, so far. The majority of all assemblages seem {{to belong to the}} latest part of the Middle Paleolithic, {{during the first half of}} MIS 3. Concerning this period, the layer G stratigraphic complex (“G-Komplex”) of Sesselfelsgrotte yielded the longest cultural sequence of late Middle Paleolithic unifacial-plus-bifacial industries (Keilmessergruppen, <b>Micoquian</b> in the sense of a “Mousterian with a <b>Micoquian</b> option”, MMO) in Central Europe. Information from this sequence permitted a reconsideration of the internal structure and the dating of the MMO. Evidence is presented for an earlier MMO stage with almost no Levallois technology (MMO-A) and a later stage (MMO-B) with Levallois technology, both occurring at the very end of the European Middle Paleolithic, between 60, 000 and 43, 000  (cal.)  B. P. The vast majority of all Middle Paleolithic sites in Germany belong to the MMO-B which was, in Southern Germany, rapidly followed by the Upper Paleolithic Aurignacian from 42  ka (cal.)  B.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two goals. The {{first is}} to provide a theoretical framework for a dynamic, morphology-independent approach to stone tool assemblage systematics and to introduce a quantitative method for evaluating relationships between assemblages based on comparisons of reduction trajectories. The second goal is to use this method to assess the relevance of an oft-cited dichotomy in European Middle Paleolithic systematics, that between assemblages with a high bifacial component and those dominated by core-and-flake technologies, {{from the point of view}} of the proposed theoretical basis for classification. The data come from three major technocomplexes: the <b>Micoquian</b> (Germany: sites of Buhlen and Sesselfelsgrotte; Crimea, Ukraine: sites of Kabazi II, V, Starosele, Chokurcha I, Buran-Kaya III), the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (MTA, France: sites of Le Moustier and Pech de l 2 ̆ 7 Azé I), and the Quina Mousterian (France: sites of Roc de Marsal and Jonzac). Reduction trajectories, expressed as allometric relationships between stone tool shape and size are viewed as ‘reversed’ ontogenies of stone tools, and are compared in the same way as biological ontogenetic trajectories. The methodology used in this study consists of converting shape data into elliptical Fourier (EFA) coefficients and tracking the latter 2 ̆ 7 s variance with size. The mathematical expressions of the change in shape as a function of size (unique to each assemblage) are linear vectors, which can be compared trigonometrically to assess overall similarity of the assemblages. The results suggest that (1) morphological variability displayed by individual Middle Paleolithic tools is very low, rendering classical typological approaches ineffective; and (2) <b>Micoquian</b> bifacial tool reduction trajectories are more similar to those of Quina Mousterian unifacial scrapers than they are to those of MTA bifacial tools. The implications of the hypothesis testing is that, when examined through a dynamic, historical prism, which includes not only production method, but also maintenance practices, therefore incorporating the entire life history of the object, a much simpler picture of taxonomic complexity than has previously been proposed for the European Middle Paleolithic emerges. ...|$|E
40|$|Ciemna Cave {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} archaeological sites documenting Middle Palaeolithic settlement in Central Europe. It has been excavated since the beginning of the 20 th century, providing rich materials commonly known for their bifacial component linked with the <b>Micoquian.</b> Since 2007 a new project has been underway focusing on the Main Chamber, which had so far been unexplored. The outcome is a much more complex picture environmental context and cultural affinities of the site. This article aims to present key questions concerning the record in the Main Chamber, but also to propose a new interpretation of Ciemna Cave as an extensive, diversified cave system. Using 3 D modelling of the bedrock of cave system’s surrounding area, we propose that dynamic filling of the cave impacted settlement there. It was proved also that the sediments in the Main Chamber are homogenous, which enables radiocarbon dating of the undisturbed sequence layers. Although new radiocarbon determinations were made using state-of-the-art pretreatment methods, we still could not fully resolve the problem of dating the upper part of the section, due to age-limit of this method...|$|E
40|$|Stone {{tools are}} often the most {{abundant}} type of cultural remains at Paleolithic sites, yet their function is often poorly understood. Investigations of stone tool function, including microscopic use-wear and residue analyses, were performed on a sample of artifacts from the Paleolithic sites of Starosele (40, 000 – 80, 000 years BP) and Buran Kaya III (32, 000 – 37, 000 years BP). The Middle Paleolithic levels at Starosele exhibit a typical variant of the local <b>Micoquian</b> Industry. The artifacts from Buran Kaya III most closely resemble an Early Streletskayan Industry associated with the early Upper Paleolithic. The results of the functional analyses suggest that hominids at both sites were exploiting woody and starchy plant material as well as birds and mammals. Both sites show evidence of hafting {{of a wide variety}} of tools and the possible use of projectile or thrusting spears. These analyses were performed by using two different techniques conducted by independent researchers. Combined residue and use-wear analyses suggest that both the Upper Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic hominids at these sites were broad-based foragers capable of exploiting a wide range of resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} and sedimentology of the Q 3 middle terrace alluvial {{sequence in}} the lower Tagus river valley, Portugal, were studied {{near the village of}} Alpiarc¸a, approximately 40 km upstream from the estuarine area. Two main stratigraphic units were recognized, separated by an important uncomformity. The Lower Gravels unit (LG) consists of intercalations of medium to coarse gravel deposits, mainly quartzitic, with coarse sandy matrix, organized in tabular bodies. The overlying Upper Sands unit (US) consists of tabular sandy channel deposits and overbank fines, the latter containing well-developed paleosols and backswamp deposits, showing a general aggrading trend, apparently with varying rates; available data indicate that deposition of the US took place under temperate climatic conditions. Within US deposits are several paleolithic archaeological sites, the lower ones in the alluvial stratigraphy being Middle Acheulian, whereas those embedded in overlying deposits are, from bottom to top, Upper Acheulian and <b>Micoquian.</b> Some of these sites have been recently excavated. The quartzite artifacts were apparently abandoned by early humans on the flood plain surface during deposition of the US unit and were subjected to limited reworking during their incorporation in the alluvium. TL/OSL dating of sandy-silty sediments, though imprecise, support archaeological evidence pointing to an age of 150, 000 to 70, 000 yr B. P. for the US unit...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} in Moldova Aurignacian industries of the lamellar type {{are represented by}} the stone collections of two kinds: with leaf-shaped points and backed points with a concave edge. Together with this the Corpach IV industry which includes backed points (segments) must have been related to Gravette. Other industries {{should not be considered}} separately and apparently can be grouped under the title "industries de type Paléolithique supérieur ancien à pointes foliacées". They are supposed to spring from the Middle Palaeolithic industries with leaf-shaped pieces (from <b>Micoquian</b> of Central Europe), that were further developed in the Aurignacian direction. If the Aurignacian of Moldova has evidently a foreign origin, then the Gravette traditions go back to some related centers. It is reflected in the compatibilty of backed pieces and leaf-shaped points in one and the same industry, dated back to the early stage of the Upper Palaeolithic. It is clearly seen in the collections of lower layers of Molodova V where homogeneousness of the complex is evident starting with the tenth layer. The appearance of some new types of tools (for instance, shouldered points) in the upper layers of this site does not fail the general stability and the cultural originality of the industry...|$|E
40|$|Buran-Kaya III is a rockshelter {{located in}} Crimea (Ukraine). It {{provides}} an exceptional stratigraphic sequence {{extending from the}} Middle Paleolithic to the Neolithic. Nine Paleolithic layers {{have been attributed to}} the Streletskaya or eastern Szeletian, <b>Micoquian,</b> Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Swiderian cultural traditions. Human remains from the richest Gravettian layer (6 - 1) are radiocarbon dated to 31. 9 ka BP, and therefore represent, with Peştera cu Oase (Romania), one of the oldest anatomically modern humans in Europe. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a controlled stratigraphic sequence of Buran-Kaya III with new 14 C dates from faunal and human bones, in their paleoenvironmental context. During our new excavations (2009 – 2011), sediments, bones, and teeth from the stratigraphical layers were sampled for sedimentological, geochemical, and 14 C analyses. Fossil bones from the 2001 excavations were also analyzed. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14 C dating, including cross-dating, was performed at Groningen, Saclay/Gif-sur-Yvette, and Oxford. Biogeochemical analysis was used to test the integrity of the bone collagen. Dates were modeled using a Bayesian approach. The sedimentological, paleoenvironmental, and chronological data are mutually consistent and show that the Paleolithic human occupations at Buran-Kaya III range from the end of MIS 3 to early MIS 1. These results provide a new chronological and paleoenvironmental framework for the human settlements in eastern Europe during the late Middle and the Upper Paleolithic. ...|$|E
40|$|The Vale do Forno {{archaeological sites}} (Alpiarça, central Portugal) {{document}} the earliest human occupation in the Lower Tejo River, well established in geomorphological and environmental terms, within the Middle Pleistocene. In a staircase of six fluvial terraces, the Palaeolithic sites {{were found on}} the T 4 terrace (þ 24 m, above river bed) which is made of a basal Lower Gravels unit (LG) and an overlying Upper Sands unit (US). Geomorphological mapping, coupled with lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and luminescence dating (quartz-OSL and K-feldspar post-IRIR 290) were used in this study. The oldest artefacts found in the LG unit show crude bifacial forms that {{can be attributed to the}} Acheulian. In contrast, the US unit has archaeological sites stratigraphically documenting successive phases of an evolved Acheulian. Luminescence dating and correlation with the Marine Isotopic Stages suggest that the LG unit has a probable age of ca. 335 to 325 ka and the US unit an age of ca. 325 to 155 ka. This is in contrast to previous interpretations ascribing this terrace (and lithic industries) to the Last Interglacial and early phases of the Last Glacial. The VF 3 site (Milhar os), containing <b>Micoquian</b> (Final Acheulian) industries (with fine and elaborated bifaces), found in a stratigraphic level located between the T 4 terrace deposits and a colluvium associated with Late Pleistocene aeolian sands, is younger than 155 ka but much older than 32 ka.

40|$|We analyze a radius bone {{fragment}} of a raven (Corvus corax) from Zaskalnaya VI rock shelter, Crimea. The object bears seven notches and {{comes from an}} archaeological level attributed to a <b>Micoquian</b> industry dated to between 38 and 43 cal kyr BP. Our study aims to examine the degree of regularity and intentionality of this set of notches through their technological and morphometric analysis, complemented by comparative experimental work. Microscopic analysis of the notches indicate that they were produced by the to-and-fro movement of a lithic cutting edge and that two notches were added {{to fill in the}} gap left between previously cut notches, probably to increase the visual consistency of the pattern. Multivariate analysis of morphometric data recorded on the archaeological notches and sets of notches cut by nine modern experimenters on radii of domestic turkeys shows that the variations recorded on the Zaskalnaya set are comparable to experimental sets made with the aim of producing similar, parallel, equidistant notches. Identification of the Weber Fraction, the constant that accounts for error in human perception, for equidistant notches cut on bone rods and its application to the Zaskalnaya set of notches and thirty-six sets of notches incised on seventeen Upper Palaeolithic bone objects from seven sites indicate that the Zaskalnaya set falls within the range of variation of regularly spaced experimental and Upper Palaeolithic sets of notches. This suggests that even if the production of the notches may have had a utilitarian reason the notches were made with the goal of producing a visually consistent pattern. This object represents the first instance of a bird bone from a Neanderthal site bearing modifications that cannot be explained as the result of butchery activities and for which a symbolic argument can be built on direct rather than circumstantial evidence...|$|E
