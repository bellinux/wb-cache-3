5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to}} be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body (internalism) or the mind is external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E

25|$|The <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set of {{cognitive}} faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, and memory. It is usually {{defined as the}} faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness. It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.|$|E
25|$|Mind proper is the {{conceptual}} and cognitive mind. <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subordinate {{process of the}} Supermind. It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life. It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has {{lost sight of the}} Divine. It is the seat of ignorance, yet it is still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different {{ways that the}} mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> purely physical construct.|$|E

25|$|Cartesian dualism {{holds that}} the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nonphysical substance, the seat of {{consciousness}} and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).|$|E
25|$|Sbyong ba is {{a variety}} of teachings for {{training}} (sbyong ba) the body, speech and mind. The training of the body entails instructions for physical posture. The training of speech mainly entails recitation, especially of the syllable hūm. The training of the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Madhyamaka-like analysis {{of the concept of}} the mind, to make clear that mind cannot arise from anywhere, reside anywhere,or go anywhere. They are in effect an establishment of emptiness by means of the intellect.|$|E
25|$|A major {{question}} is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share {{the same set of}} basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.|$|E

25|$|Dualism {{is closely}} {{associated}} with the thought of René Descartes (1641), which holds that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, {{he was the first to}} formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.|$|E
25|$|Conquest of <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{book that}} {{describes}} practices {{and strategies for}} leading the spiritual life. Written by Eknath Easwaran, the strategies are intended to be usable within any major religious tradition, or outside of all traditions. The book was originally published in the United States in 1988. Multiple revised English-language editions have been published, and translations have also appeared in several other European and Asian languages. The book has been reviewed in newspapers and magazines. In Conquest of Mind, Easwaran provides a much more extensive discussion of how his program {{can be used to}} train the mind, and the importance of training the mind.|$|E
25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the {{position}} that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It {{can be traced back}} to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.|$|E

25|$|A Beautiful <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2001 American biographical drama film {{based on}} the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. The film was {{directed}} by Ron Howard, from a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman. It was inspired by a bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-nominated 1998 book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar. The film stars Russell Crowe, along with Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, and Christopher Plummer in supporting roles. The story begins in Nash's days as a graduate student at Princeton University. Early in the film, Nash begins to develop paranoid schizophrenia and endures delusional episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on wife Alicia and friends.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E
