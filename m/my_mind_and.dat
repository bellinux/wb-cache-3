I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> at once {{it struck me}} what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E

500|$|On Duchovny's request, Spotnitz and Carter wrote {{a larger}} role for Skinner than usual, giving him the moral dilemma {{of whether or not}} to kill Scully's unborn child or Mulder. In the end, Spotnitz called the effects of his actions, {{particularly}} the aftermath of taking Mulder off life support, a [...] "nice sort of unexpected turn". Scully's role in [...] "Deadalive" [...] was partly based on the 1954 film Magnificent Obsession, in which a young man accidentally blinds a woman and subsequently becomes a doctor to cure her. Spotnitz noted, [...] "that movie was on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> not in a good way when we were imagining Scully in this operating room where Mulder was being worked on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can I Have It Like That" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Entertainment Weekly {{called it an}} [...] "odd opener" [...] to In <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>and</b> remarked that Williams [...] "never commits to putting his hips into it", leaving the track without any climax. [...] The Observers Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as [...] "a grinding instant smash". For IGN, Spence Abbott described Williams' rapping as [...] "a little sticky, but…ruggedly appealing {{in a manner of}} speaking", and commented that [...] "it's the shuffling and infectious beat…that will have you swerving and slinking like a cobra with epilepsy." [...] In his review for Slant Magazine, Preston Jones characterized the song as [...] "curiously inert", adding that it sounded better as a sample on Girl Talk's 2006 mashup album Night Ripper.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the initial}} founders of Brook Farm was author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne did not {{particularly}} agree with {{the ideals of the}} experiment, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody. She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away. Ripley was aware of Hawthorne's motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing [...] "Direction of Finance". After requesting his initial investment be returned, Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842. He wrote of his displeasure with the community: [...] "even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> heart were freer.....Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruisdael {{has shaped}} {{landscape}} painting traditions from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, {{as well as}} generations of Dutch landscape artists. Among the English artists influenced by Ruisdael are Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner, and John Constable. Gainsborough drew, in black chalk and grey wash, a replica of a Ruisdael in the 1740s—now both paintings are housed in the Louvre in Paris. Turner made many copies of Ruisdaels and even painted fantasy views of a nonexistent port he called Port Ruysdael. Constable also copied various drawings, etchings and paintings by Ruisdael, and was a great admirer from a young age. [...] "It haunts <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> clings to my heart", he wrote after seeing a Ruisdael. However, he thought Jewish Cemetery was a failure, because he considered that it attempted to convey something outside the reach of art.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1921 Grainger {{moved with}} his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was [...] his [...] home for the {{remainder}} of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from [...] delusions and nightmares, and became [...] fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been [...] rumours that [...] their relationship was incestuous; [...] in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough. From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window [...] on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City. The letter, which began [...] "I am out of <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> cannot think properly", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of [...] "improper love". She signed the letter: [...] "Your poor insane mother".|$|E
500|$|On 8 March 1870, Schottlaender {{abducted}} the 17-year-old Bond {{on her way}} to sing at {{a church}} service, took her to a friend's house and forced her to stay the night with him. [...] Schottlaender convinced her that she was [...] "compromised" [...] and that they must marry. [...] The next day, she was taken to Manchester, where they were married. The marriage was a terrible experience for Bond, and she became pregnant and ill. [...] "He ill-treated both <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> my body, he denied me every comfort, often I had not even enough to eat. [...] To add to my wretchedness, the inevitable baby was coming. ... He had been violently ill-treating me, I was a broken, pitiful creature." [...] Her family persuaded her to leave him after ten months of marriage. Bond contracted smallpox from the doctor who attended her, but she recovered. The baby, Sidney John Arthur Schottlaender, was born on 7 May 1871 and died on 18 June 1871, six weeks later. The couple lived separately for several years, and Bond finally divorced her husband in 1874. Bond stated in her divorce petition that she had been knowingly infected with a communicable disease by her husband.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E
