2500|$|Andradite is a calcium-iron garnet, Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, is of {{variable}} composition {{and may be}} red, yellow, brown, green or black. The recognized varieties are topazolite (yellow or green), demantoid (green) and <b>melanite</b> (black). Andradite is found both in deep-seated igneous rocks like syenite as well as serpentines, schists, and crystalline limestone. Demantoid {{has been called the}} [...] "emerald of the Urals" [...] from its occurrence there, {{and is one of the}} most prized of garnet varieties. Topazolite is a golden-yellow variety and <b>melanite</b> is a black variety.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered the 1960s, {{the rich}} green tsavorite variety of {{grossular}} {{is also very}} popular. Both grossular and andradite are isotropic and have relatively high RIs (around 1.74 and 1.89 respectively) and high dispersions (0.027 and 0.057), with demantoid's exceeding diamond. However, both have a low hardness (6.5–7.5) and invariably possess inclusions atypical for diamond—the byssolite [...] "horsetails" [...] seen in demantoid are one striking example. Furthermore, most are very small, typically under 0.5 carats (100mg) in weight. Their lusters range from vitreous to subadamantine, to almost metallic in the usually opaque <b>melanite,</b> which {{has been used to}} simulate black diamond. Some natural spinel is also deep black and could serve this same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), <b>melanite</b> (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E

In the process of production of phenolic resins, exists as a product distilled {{in the presence of}} phenol at high concentrations (approximately 5 %), which is part of industrial wastewater effluent, with this part of the environmental problem that this paper proposes a industry a new technique for recovery, reuse and contribution to the environment. Its adverse effects submitted, the final destination of phenol in the environment and its removal is complicated and difficult by several factors: its high solubility in water at room temperature, its ability to ionize, low vapor pressure, its tendency to oxidation, to possess properties and characteristics of reactivity, stability and amphoteric (not biodegradable), can exist in the environment without losing its character under more drastic harmful, causing negative environmental impact. The proposed method offers new technology to recover the phenol is dissolved in industrial water through a chemical reaction with sodium hydroxide, to recover as sodium phenolate, which serves to reuse in the same process of the phenolic resin of novolac type. The secondary distillate from the distillation process of the sodium phenolate solution, even with traces of phenol was adsorbed completely through the bed of granular activated carbon, which guarantees the residual distillate without the presence of phenol for disposal or sewer outfall; contributing the same management and minimization of environmental impacts, particularly the aquatic environment. In the market there are several methodologies for the removal and wastewater treatment in the presence of phenol from the incineration, chemical degradation, biodegradation up heat, but still the resulting constraints are: phenol incineration of gaseous emissions (CO, CO 2, water vapor, etc [...] ) providing to the pollution of air quality and global warming of the planet earth, treatment of phenol biodegradation involves a need for space very large, low concentration of phenol and specialized bacteria are very sensitive to changing conditions, which is not in the treatment of phenolic industrial wastewater and chemical treatment for thermal degradation is very expensive, unlike the physicochemical and absorption method activated charcoal proposed is efficient, easy to use in the treatment of phenol, using input chemicals (NaOH and granular activated carbon) available on the market at low cost, making the method for the recovery of phenol in wastewater proposed industrial sector represents an alternative in the management and treatment of industrial water in order to preserve the aquatic environment mainly. We have developed a new technique physicochemical laboratorial y technique with an resultat eficient outcome, the proposed method has been shown to 96. 17 % recovery of phenol in industrial wastewater and the rest of phenol is treated with the technique of absorption granular activated carbon, which is demonstrated with a 100 % removal of phenol in industrial waste waters, it contributes to the field of science and industry to management, treatment and disposal charge compatible with the preservation and care of the environment, given that their industrial wastewater to the sewer may be available or surface water body (sea, river, lake, etc.), below the allowable limits, according to relevant industry standards, for example, for the Sub Sector Hydrocarbons must have industrial wastewater below the permissible limits, according to Article 1 of Supreme Decree N º 037 - 2008 -PCM "maximum permissible limits for liquid effluents to the Activities Sub-Sector Oil" to not impact the quality of surface waters in compliance of Supreme Decree N º 002 - 2008 -MINAM and Water Resources Act, it contributes to responsible environmental management, which minimizes the impact to aquatic ecosystems. The recovered phenol through the technique described above is broadly applicable in the same production process of phenolic resins. Phenol recovered can also be applied in the wood's conservation (manufacture of plywood, manufacture of pressed wood, iron, <b>melanites,</b> etc.). This research work in the management and treatment of phenol in industrial wastewater proposed, given other environmental tool to companies engaged in the business phenolic, so they can make use of this method in the management and treatment of these hazardous waste and avoid hiring firms EPS-RS for the management, treatment, transportation and disposal of such hazardous waste to a secure landfill, according to Supreme Decree 057 - 2004 -PCM. With this grant is contributing to environmental management that respects the environment, since it does not have the substance be toxic to aquatic ecosystems, which can negatively impact aquatic flora and fauna. To arrive at developing the experimental part, results from a literature search, mainly in journals or magazines for professionals and researchers, as well as communications made in conferences or symposiums, Doctoral thesis, etc. This research has allowed, among other things, support research that is desired to avoid undertaking research already carried out, to take cognizance of experiments already made to repeat them when necessary, further investigations interrupted or incomplete, seeking information suggestive, select a theoretical framework for the literature review. The undersigned concluyes that the research developed as the main objetive of this thesis is an efficient, economical and easy method for the application during the extraction and separation of phenol in industrial wastewater. It is a contribution to the environmentally responsible management and minimization of hazardous substances that can negatively impact the environment and, finally, is an environmental management tool for industry to manage and minimize environmental impacts. En la actualidad, muchas empresas están dedicadas al rubro de plastificantes moldeables, en las refinerías de petróleo, en la industria de química, en la producción de resinas fenólicas principalmente, que generan efluentes residuales industriales con altas concentraciones de compuestos orgánicos, en donde tienen gran destaque la presencia de sustancias fenólicas. En el proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas, existe como subproducto un destilado con presencia de fenol en altas concentraciones (aproximadamente 5 %), que forma parte del efluente residual industrial, siendo esta parte del problema ambiental, que el presente trabajo de investigación propone a la industria una nueva técnica de recuperación, reuso y aporte al ambiente. Sus efectos adversos presentados, el destino final del fenol en el ambiente y su remoción es complicado y difícil por diversos factores: su alta solubilidad en el agua a temperatura ambiente, su habilidad para ionizarse, su baja presión de vapor, su tendencia a la oxidación, por poseer propiedades y características de reactividad, estabilidad y anfotérico (no biodegradable), puede existir en el ambiente sin perder su carácter nocivo en condiciones más drásticas, causando impacto negativo al medio ambiente. El método propuesto propone una nueva tecnología que consiste en recuperar el fenol disuelto en agua industrial a través de una reacción química con hidróxido de sodio, para recuperar como fenolato de sodio, que sirve para reusar en el mismo proceso de la resina fenólica del tipo las novolacas. El destilado secundario del proceso de destilación de la solución fenolato de sodio, aún con trazas de fenol es adsorbido totalmente a través del lecho de carbón activado granulado, que garantiza el destilado residual sin presencia de fenol para su disposición final al alcantarillado o emisor submarino; la misma que contribuye el manejo y minimización de impacto al medio ambiente, en especial al medio acuático. En el mercado existen varios metodologías para la remoción y tratamiento de aguas residuales con presencia de fenol desde la incineración, biodegradación hasta degradación química térmica, siendo los limitantes más resultantes tenemos: la incineración de fenol genera emisiones gaseosas (CO, CO 2, vapor de agua, etc.) que aporta a la contaminación de la calidad de aire y al calentamiento global de la planeta tierra; tratamiento de fenol por biodegradación involucra necesidad de contar con un espacio muy grande, con baja concentración de fenol y bacterias pecializadas muy sensibles al cambio de condiciones, que no es aplicable en el tratamiento de aguas residuales industriales con fenol; y el tratamiento por degradación química térmica es muy costoso, a diferencia del método fisicoquímico y absorción con carbón activado propuesto, es eficiente, fácil manejo en el tratamiento de fenol, uso de insumo químico comercial (NaOH y carbón activado granulado) a disposición en el mercado con un costo bajo, haciendo que el método para la recuperación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales propuesto represente al sector industrial una alternativa en el manejo y tratamiento de dicho agua industrial con la finalidad de preservar el ambiente acuático principalmente. Se ha desarrollado una nueva técnica fisicoquímica a nivel de laboratorio con resultado eficiente, es decir, con el método propuesto se ha demostrado la recuperación al 96. 17 % de fenol en aguas residuales industriales y, el resto de fenol es tratado con la técnica de absorción con carbón activado granulado, con el cual se demuestra una remoción del 100 % de fenol en aguas industriales, la misma que contribuye al campo científico y al sector industrial a un manejo, tratamiento y disposición final responsable compatible con la preservación y cuidado al medio ambiente, toda vez que sus aguas residuales industriales se puede disponer al alcantarillado o al cuerpo de agua superficial (mar, río, laguna, etc.), por debajo de los límites permitidos, según las normas del sector correspondiente; por ejemplo, para el Sub Sector Hidrocarburos, hay que disponer las aguas residuales industriales por debajo de los límites permisibles, de acuerdo al Art. 1 º del Decreto Supremo Nº 037 - 2008 -PCM “Límites Máximos Permisibles de Efluentes Líquidos para las Actividades del Sub-Sector Hidrocarburos”, a fin de no impactar la calidad de aguas superficiales, en cumplimiento del Decreto Supremo Nº 002 - 2008 -MINAM y la Ley de Recursos Hídricos, la misma que contribuye a un manejo ambiental responsable, que minimiza el impacto al ecosistema acuático. El fenol recuperado a través de la técnica descrito en líneas arriba tiene aplicación en el mismo proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas. También el fenol recuperado puede tener aplicación en el tratamiento de maderas (fabricación de triplay, fabricación de madera prensado, planchas, melanitas, etc.) como preservativos. Con el presente trabajo de investigación en el manejo y tratamiento de fenol en aguas residuales industriales se propone otra herramienta ambiental a las empresas dedicadas en el rubro fenólicas, para que pueden hacer uso de este método en el manejo y tratamiento de estos residuos peligrosos y así evitar contratar empresas EPS-RS para el manejo, tratamiento, transporte y disposición final de dicho residuo peligroso a un relleno de seguridad, de acuerdo al Decreto Supremo N° 057 - 2004 -PCM. Con este aporte se está contribuyendo al manejo ambiental responsable con el medio ambiente, toda vez que no se va disponer la sustancia toxica al ecosistema acuático, que puede impactar negativamente a la flora y fauna acuática. Para llegar a desarrollar la parte experimental, se ha realizado una investigación bibliográfica, fundamentalmente en journals o revistas destinadas a profesionales e investigadores, como así también las comunicaciones hechas en Congresos o Simposios, tesis de doctorado, etc. Esta indagación ha permitido, entre otras cosas, apoyar la investigación que se desea realizar, evitar emprender investigaciones ya realizadas, tomar conocimiento de experimentos ya hechos para repetirlos cuando sea necesario, continuar investigaciones interrumpidas o incompletas, buscar información sugerente, seleccionar un marco teórico para el estudio bibliográfico. El suscrito concluye que el trabajo de investigación desarrollado que es materia de esta tesis, es un eficiente, económico y método fácil en la aplicación en la extracción y separación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales. Es una contribución en el manejo responsable con el ambiente y minimización de sustancias peligrosas que puede impactar negativamente al medio ambiente y, finalmente, es una herramienta de gestión ambiental para el sector industrial para el manejo y minimización de impactos al medio ambiente...|$|R
6000|$|The {{writer of}} this romance has been {{encouraged}} to his task by a purpose somewhat beyond that of setting out a wild tale of savage life. When he was yet a lad,--now some seventeen years ago,--fortune took him to South Africa. There he was thrown in with men who, for thirty or forty years, had been intimately acquainted with the Zulu people, with their history, their heroes, and their customs. From these he heard many tales and traditions, some of which, perhaps, are rarely told nowadays, and in time to come may cease to be told altogether. Then the Zulus were still a nation; now that nation has been destroyed, and the chief aim of its white rulers is to root out the warlike spirit {{for which it was}} remarkable, and to replace it by a spirit of peaceful progress. The Zulu military organisation, perhaps the most wonderful that the world has seen, is already a thing of the past; it perished at Ulundi. It was Chaka who invented that organisation, building it up from the smallest beginnings. When he appeared at the commencement of this century, it was as the ruler of a single small tribe; when he fell, in the year 1828, beneath the assegais of his brothers, Umhlangana and Dingaan, and of his servant, Mopo or Umbopo, as he is called also, all south-eastern Africa was at his feet, and in his march to power he had slaughtered more than a million human beings. An attempt has been made in these pages to set out the true character of this colossal genius and most evil man,--a Napoleon and a Tiberius in one,--and also that of his brother and successor, Dingaan, so no more need be said of them here. The author's aim, moreover, has been to convey, in a narrative form, some idea of the remarkable spirit which animated these kings and their subjects, and to make accessible, in a popular shape, incidents of history which are now, for the most part, only to be found in a few scarce works of reference, rarely consulted, except by students. It will be obvious that such a task has presented difficulties, since he who undertakes it must for a time forget his civilisation, and think with the mind and speak with the voice of a Zulu of the old regime. All the horrors perpetrated by the Zulu tyrants cannot be published in this polite age of <b>melanite</b> and torpedoes; their details have, therefore, been suppressed. Still much remains, and those who think it wrong that massacre and fighting should be written of,--except by special correspondents,--or that the sufferings of mankind beneath one of the world's most cruel tyrannies should form the groundwork of romance, may be invited to leave this book unread. Most, indeed nearly all, of the historical incidents here recorded are substantially true. Thus, it is said that Chaka did actually kill his mother, Unandi, for the reason given, and destroy an entire tribe in the Tatiyana cleft, and that he prophesied of the coming of the white man after receiving his death wounds. Of the incident of the Missionary and the furnace of logs, it is impossible to speak so certainly. It came to the writer from the lips of an old traveller in [...] "the Zulu"; but he cannot discover any confirmation of it. Still, these kings undoubtedly put their soldiers to many tests of equal severity. Umbopo, or Mopo, as he is named in this tale, actually lived. After he had stabbed Chaka, he rose to great eminence. Then he disappears from the scene, but it is not accurately known whether he also went [...] "the way of the assegai," [...] or perhaps, as is here suggested, came to live near Stanger under the name of Zweete. The fate of the two lovers {{at the mouth of the}} cave is a true Zulu tale, which has been considerably varied to suit the purposes of this romance. The late Mr. Leslie, who died in 1874, tells it in his book [...] "Among the Zulus and Amatongas." [...] "I heard a story the other day," [...] he says, [...] "which, if the power of writing fiction were possessed by me, I might have worked up into a first-class sensational novel." [...] It is the story that has been woven into the plot of this book. To him also the writer is indebted for the artifice by which Umslopogaas obtained admission to the Swazi stronghold; it was told to Mr. Leslie by the Zulu who performed the feat and thereby won a wife. Also the writer's thanks are due to his friends, Mr. F. B. Fynney, (1) late Zulu border agent, for much information given to him in bygone years by word of mouth, and more recently through his pamphlet [...] "Zululand and the Zulus," [...] and to Mr. John Bird, formerly treasurer to the Government of Natal, whose compilation, [...] "The Annals of Natal," [...] is invaluable to all who would study the early history of that colony and of Zululand.|$|E

50|$|The 1911 Britannica {{described}} borolanite as: one of {{the most}} remarkable rocks of the British Isles, found on the shores of Loch Borolan (Loch Borralan) in Sutherland, after which it has been named. In this locality there is a considerable area of granite rich in red alkali feldspar, and passing, by diminution in the amount of its quartz, into quartz-syenites and syenites. At the margins of the outcrop patches of nepheline syenite occur; usually the nepheline is decomposed, but occasionally it is well preserved; the other ingredients of the rock are brown garnet (<b>melanite)</b> and aegirine. The abundance of <b>melanite</b> is very unusual in igneous rocks, though some syenites, leucitophyres, and aegirine-felsites resemble borolanite in this respect. In places the nepheline syenite assumes the form of a dark rock with large rounded white spots. These last consist of an intermixture of nepheline or sodalite and alkali-feldspar. From the analogy of certain leucite syenites which are known in Arkansas, it is very probable that these spots represent original leucites which have been changed into aggregates of the above-named minerals. They resemble leucite in their shape, but have not yet been proved to have its crystalline outlines. The pseudo-leucites, as they have been called, measure one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch across. The dark matrix consists of biotite, aegirine-augite and <b>melanite.</b> Connected with the borolanite there are other types of nepheline syenite and pegmatite. In Finland, <b>melanite</b> bearing nepheline rocks have been found and described as ijolite, but the only other locality for melanite-leucite-syenite is Magnet Cove igneous complex in Arkansas.|$|E

50|$|Gugiaite {{is usually}} found in skarn {{in contact with}} {{alkaline}} syenite with <b>melanite,</b> orthoclase, aegirine, titanite, apatite, vesuvianite, and prehnite (Peng et al. 1962). It occurs as thin square tablets, to 3 mm, in small cavities in skarn and enclosed in <b>melanite</b> (Peng et al. 1962). Skarns are often formed at the contact zone between granite intrusions and carbonate sedimentary rocks through metasomatism. Gugiaite has also been found in a miarolitic cavity in granite (Grew 2002). This type of cavity is crystal lined, irregular, and known for being a source of rare minerals, such as beryllium, that are not normally found in abundance in igneous rocks (http://web.archive.org/web/20091028021704/http://geocities.com/oklahomamgs/London/Pegmatite2.html). While initially found in Gugia, China, its localities have expanded to include Piedmont, Italy, Ehime Prefecture, Japan, Eastern Siberian Region, Russia, and most recently Telemark, Norway (http://www.mindat.org/min-1769.html).|$|E

5000|$|Gugiaite is a melilite mineral, {{named for}} the Chinese village of Gugia where it was first discovered. Its {{chemical}} formula is Ca2BeSi2O7 It occurs mostly in skarns with <b>melanite</b> adjacent to an alkali syenite and has no economic value. Its crystals are small tetragonal tablets with vitreous luster and perfect cleavage. It is colorless and transparent with a density of three. The mineral belongs to space group P-421m and is strongly piezoelectric.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} contains pyroclastic flows, lahars, agglomerates, tuffs and ash-fall deposits, {{as well as}} volcanic-rich sandstones {{and other}} sediments. The whole-rock chemistry of the volcanics is relatively normal, ranging from trachyandesite (latite) to phonolite and trachyte, but the mineralogy is unusual. In addition to analcime and <b>melanite,</b> common minerals include sanidine, aegerine-augite and chlorite. Blairmorite, a rare analcime-rich rock-type named for the town of Blairmore, Alberta, is known only from the Crowsnest Formation and a locality in Mozambique.|$|E
5000|$|Rocks {{from the}} Cretaceous include syenite {{porphyry}} sills and dykes near Cygnet around [...] They intrude the Lower Parmeener Group rocks, and dolerite. There {{are two kinds}} of composition, one is high alkali, alumina, silicon and barium containing <b>melanite</b> garnet; the other is high in potassium with nepheline and hauyne.

50|$|The Crowsnest Formation, {{also called}} the Crowsnest Volcanics, is a {{geological}} formation in southwestern Alberta, Canada, on the southwestern margin of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. It was named for the Crowsnest Pass near Coleman, Alberta. The formation consists mostly of pyroclastic rocks that were laid down {{in a series of}} explosive eruptions about 100 million years ago during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous epoch. It contains unusual minerals such as <b>melanite</b> (a variety of andradite garnet) and analcime (a variety of zeolite).|$|E
50|$|The pyroxenites {{are often}} subject serpentinization under low {{temperature}} retrograde metamorphism and weathering. The rocks are often completely replaced by serpentines, which sometimes preserve the original {{structures of the}} primary minerals, such as the lamination of hypersthene and the rectangular cleavage of augite. Under pressure-metamorphism hornblende is developed and various types of amphibolite and hornblende-schist are produced. Occasionally rocks rich in pyroxene are found as basic facies of nepheline syenite; {{a good example is}} provided by the <b>melanite</b> pyroxenites associated with the borolanite variety found in the Loch Borralan igneous complex of Scotland.|$|E
50|$|Sodalite, colorless and {{transparent}} in thin section, but frequently pale {{blue in the}} hand specimens, is the principal feldspathoid mineral in addition to nepheline. Reddish-brown to black triclinic aenigmatite occurs also in these rocks. Extremely iron-rich olivine is rare, but is present in some nepheline syenite. Other minerals common in minor amounts include sodium-rich pyroxene, biotite, titanite, iron oxides, apatite, fluorite, <b>melanite</b> garnet, and zircon. Cancrinite occurs in several nepheline-syenites. A great number of interesting and rare minerals have been recorded from nepheline syenites and the pegmatite veins which intersect them.|$|E
50|$|By far {{the greater}} number of the rocks which contain leucite are lavas of Tertiary or recent {{geological}} age. Although these never contain quartz, but feldspar is usually present, though there are certain groups of leucite lavas which are non-feldspathic. Many of them also contain nepheline, sodalite, hauyne and nosean; the much rarer mineral melilite appears also in some examples. The commonest ferromagnesian mineral is augite (sometimes rich in sodium), with olivine in the more basic varieties. Hornblende and biotite occur also, but are less common. <b>Melanite</b> is found {{in some of the}} lavas, as in the leucite syenites.|$|E
50|$|Most {{residents}} of Rusinga {{make their living}} from subsistence agriculture (maize and millet), as well as fishing. The native tilapia is still caught, though this species (like all others native to the lake) has been decimated by the voracious Nile perch that was introduced into the lake in 1954. Constant onshore winds cool the lakeward {{side of the island}} and provide clean beaches with ideal swimming and boating conditions, but poor roads between Rusinga and the nearest town, Homa Bay, inhibit trade and tourism. The brightly glittering black sands of the beaches are made of crystals of <b>melanite</b> garnet, barkevikite hornblende, and magnetite eroded from the uncompahgrite lava fragments in the agglomerates that overlie the fossil beds.|$|E
5000|$|Discovered the 1960s, {{the rich}} green tsavorite variety of {{grossular}} {{is also very}} popular. Both grossular and andradite are isotropic and have relatively high RIs (ca. 1.74 and 1.89, respectively) and high dispersions (0.027 and 0.057), with demantoid's exceeding diamond. However, both have a low hardness (6.5-7.5) and invariably possess inclusions atypical of diamond—the byssolite [...] "horsetails" [...] seen in demantoid are one striking example. Furthermore, most are very small, typically under 0.5 carats (100 mg) in weight. Their lusters range from vitreous to subadamantine, to almost metallic in the usually opaque <b>melanite,</b> which {{has been used to}} simulate black diamond. Some natural spinel is also a deep black and could serve this same purpose.|$|E
50|$|The {{plutonic}} leucite-bearing {{rocks are}} leucite syenite and missourite. Of these the former consists of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite, diopside and aegirine, biotite and sphene. Two occurrences are known, one in Arkansas, {{the other in}} Sutherland, Scotland. The Scottish rock has been called borolanite. Both examples show large rounded spots in the hand specimens; they are pseudoleucites, and under the microscope prove to consist of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite and decomposition products. These have a radiate arrangement externally, but are of irregular structure at their centres; {{it is interesting to}} note that in both rocks <b>melanite</b> is an important accessory. The missourites are more mafic and consist of leucite, olivine, augite and biotite; the leucite is partly fresh partly altered to analcite, and the rock has a spotted character recalling that of the leucite-syenites. It has been found only in the Highwood Mountains of Montana.|$|E
50|$|Leucite lavas {{from which}} {{feldspar}} is absent {{are divided into}} the leucitites and leucite basalts. The latter contain olivine, the former do not. Pyroxene is the usual ferromagnesian mineral, and resembles that of the tephrites and basanites. Sanidine, <b>melanite,</b> hauyne and perovskite are frequent accessory minerals in these rocks, {{and many of them}} contain melilite in some quantity, The well-known leucitite of the Capo di Bove, near, Rome, is rich in this mineral, which forms irregular plates, yellow in the hand specimen, enclosing many small rounded crystals of leucite. Bracciano and Roccamonfina are other Italian localities for leucitite, and in Java, Montana, Celebes and New South Wales similar rocks occur, The leucite basalts belong to more basic types and are rich in olivine and augite. They occur in great numbers in the Rhenish volcanic district (Eifel, Laacher See) and in Bohemia, and accompany tephrites or leucitites in Java, Montana, Celebes and Sardinia. The peperino of the neighborhood of Rome is a leucitite tuff.|$|E
5000|$|In pre-Tertiary rocks leucite readily {{decomposes}} {{and changes}} to zeolites, analcite and other secondary minerals. Leucite also {{is rare in}} plutonic rocks and dike rocks, but leucite syenite and leucite tinguaite {{bear witness to the}} possibility that it may occur in this manner. The rounded shape of its crystals, their white or grey color, and absence of planar cleavage make the presence of leucite easily determinable in many of these rocks by inspection, especially when the crystals are large."Pseudoleucites" [...] are rounded areas consisting of feldspar, nepheline, analcite, &c., which have the shape, composition and sometimes even the outward crystalline shape of leucite; they are probably pseudomorphs or paramorphs, which have developed from leucite because this mineral is not stable at ordinary temperatures and can be expected under favorable conditions to undergo spontaneous change into an aggregate of other minerals. Leucite is very often accompanied by nepheline, sodalite or nosean; other minerals which make their appearance with some frequency are <b>melanite,</b> garnet and melilite.|$|E
50|$|The {{rocks in}} which {{orthoclase}} (or sanidine) {{is present in}} considerable amount are leucite-trachytes, leucite-phonolites and leucitophvres. Of these groups the two former, which are not sharply distinguished from one another by most authors, are common {{in the neighborhood of}} Rome. They are of trachytic appearance, containing phenocysts of sanidine, leucite, augite and biotite. Sodalite or hauyne may also be present, but nepheline is typically absent. Rocks of this class occur also in the tuffs of the Phlegraean Fields, near Naples. The leucitophyres are rare rocks which have been described from various parts of the volcanic district of the Rhine (Olbrck. Laacher See, etc.) and from Monte Vulture in Italy. They are rich in leucite, but contain also some sanidine and often much nepheline with hauyne or nosean. Their pyroxene is principally aegirine or aegirine-augite; some of them are rich in <b>melanite.</b> Microscopic sections of some of these rocks are of great interest on account of their beauty and the variety of feldspathoid minerals which they contain. In Brazil leucitophyres have been found which belong to the Carboniferous period.|$|E
50|$|The leucite-hearing dike-rocks {{are members}} of the tinguaite and monchiquite groups. The leucite tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist principally of nepheline, alkali {{feldspar}} and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines of the ground mass. Where leucite occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the ground mass, or in larger masses which have the same characters as the pseudoleucites. Biotite occurs in some of these rocks, and <b>melanite</b> also is present. Nepheline decreases in amount as leucite increases since the abundances of the two reflect the Na:K ratio of the rock. Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are leucite tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte. Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and nepheline syenites. Leucite monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting of olivine, titaniferous augite and iron oxides, with a glassy ground mass in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered. They have been described from Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5000|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5-4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), <b>melanite</b> (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885-2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105-0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
50|$|Those leucite rocks {{which contain}} {{abundant}} essential plagioclase feldspar {{are known as}} leucite tephrites and leucite basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; <b>melanite</b> and nepheline may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens. From Volcan Ello, Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained; they occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor.|$|E
40|$|In three veins {{from the}} lower part of Deep Sea Drilling Project Hole 504 B, 298 meters below the top of basement, primary augite is {{replaced}} by aegirine-augite. This transformation occurs only in subophitic basalts, at the contact with veins which always include a dark-olive, Mg-rich clay mineral. Talc occurs in one of these veins; it can be regarded either as a vein constituent or as a product of augite alteration. <b>Melanite</b> (Ca,Fe,Ti-rich garnet) appears in only one of these three veins, where a Ca-carbonate is associated with a Mg-rich clay mineral. The occurrence of <b>melanite</b> in Hole 504 B could be due to the conjunction of particular conditions: (1) basalt with a subophitic texture, (2) presence of hydrothermal fluids carrying Ca, Fe, Si, Ti, Al, Mg, and Na, (3) rather high temperatures. Possibly the <b>melanite</b> and aegirine-augite formed by deuteric alteration...|$|E
40|$|This {{original}} project {{resulted in}} a detailed crystal chemical data map of a titanium rich garnet (<b>melanite)</b> suite that originates from the Crowsnest Volcanics of Alberta Canada. Garnet is typically present during the partial melting of the earth's mantle to produce basalt. Prior studies conducted at Youngstown State University have yielded questions as to the crystal structure of the <b>melanite.</b> In the Studies conducted at Youngstown State University, {{through the use of}} single crystal x-ray diffraction, the c-axis appears to be distorted creating a tetragonal crystal instead of the typical cubic crystal of garnets. The micro probe was used on the same suite of titanium rich garnets as used in the single crystal x-ray diffraction. The combination of the single crystal x-ray research and the detailed microprobe research will allow us to determine the exact crystal chemical structure of the <b>melanite</b> garnet. The crystal chemical data was gathered through the utilization of the SX 100 Electron Probe Micro Analyzer. Determination of the exact chemical nature may prove useful in modeling the ultramafic source rock responsible for the formation of the titanium rich lunar basalts...|$|E
40|$|The mineral {{chemistry}} of <b>melanite</b> garnets from the Crowsnest volcanic rocks of SW Alberta, Canada, {{has been investigated}} by using electron microprobe scans, quantitative analyses and multivariate statistical analysis. The garnets occur with aegirine-augite, sanidine, analcite and rare plagioclase as phenocrysts in trachyte and phonolite flows, agglomerates and tuffs. Wavelength dispersive microprobe scans reveal complex zonation patterns, both normal and oscillatory. The results of fifty quantitative analyses were subjected to R-mode factor analysis to delineate the chemical exchanges producing the zonation. The chemical zonation of the garnets {{may be attributed to}} four independent binary exchanges; Al-Fe 3 +, Si-Ti, Ca-Mn and Mg-Fe 2 +. The stoichiometry of these garnets, based on microprobe and wet chemical Fe analyses, combined with the strongly antithetic behavior of Si and Ti lead us to infer that the Ti in these garnets is dominantly tetravalent. It is clear from this study that quantitative modelling of the processes of crystal growth and zonation of <b>melanite</b> garnets in alkaline, undersaturated igneous rocks should be aimed at simulating the four chemical exchanges listed above. ...|$|E
40|$|The Cretaceous Banhadão {{alkaline}} {{complex in}} southeastern Brazil presents two potassic SiO 2 -undersaturated series. The high-Ca magmatic series consist of initially fractionated olivine (Fo 92 - 91) + diopside (Wo 48 - 43 En 49 - 35 Ae 0 - 7), {{as evidenced by}} the presence of xenocrysts and xenoliths. In that sequence, diopside (Wo 47 - 38 En 46 - 37 Ae 0 - 8) + phlogopite + apatite + perovskite (Prv > 92) crystallized to form the phlogopite melteigite and led to the Ca enrichment of the magma. Diopside (Wo 47 - 41 En 32 - 24 Ae 3 - 14) continued to crystallize as an early mafic mineral, followed by nepheline (Ne 74. 8 - 70. 1 Ks 26. 3 - 21. 2 Qz 7. 6 - 0. 9) and leucite (Lc 65 - 56) and subsequently by <b>melanite</b> and potassic feldspar (Or 85 - 99 Ab 1 - 7) to form <b>melanite</b> ijolites, wollastonite-melanite urtites and melanite-nepheline syenites. Melanite-pseudoleucite-nepheline syenites are interpreted to be a leucite accumulation. <b>Melanite</b> nephelinite dykes are believed to represent some of the magmatic differentiation steps. The low-Ca magmatic series is representative of a typical fractionation of aegirine-augite (Wo 36 - 29 En 25 - 4 Ae 39 - 18) + alkali feldspar (Or 57 - 96 Ab 3 - 43) + nepheline (Ne 76. 5 - 69. 0 Ks 19. 9 - 14. 4 Qz 15. 1 - 7. 7) + titanite from phonolite magma. The evolution of this series from potassic nepheline syenites to sodic sodalite syenites and sodalitolites is attributed to an extensive fractionation of potassic feldspar, which led to an increase of the NaCl activity in the melt during the final stages forming sodalite-rich rocks. Phonolite dykes followed a similar evolutionary process and also registered some crustal assimilation. The mesocratic nepheline syenites showed interactions with phlogopite melteigites, such as compatible trace element enrichments and the presence of diopside xenocrysts, which were interpreted to be due to a mixing/mingling process of phonolite and nephelinite magmas. The geochemical data show higher TiO 2 and P 2 O 5 contents and lower SiO 2 contents for the high-Ca series and different LILE evolution trends and REE chondrite-normalized patterns as compared to the low-Ca series. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb initial ratios for the high-Ca series (0. 70407 - 0. 70526, 0. 51242 - 0. 51251, 17. 782 - 19. 266 and 38. 051 - 39. 521, respectively) were slightly {{different from those of the}} low-Ca series (0. 70542 - 0. 70583, 0. 51232 - 0. 51240, 17. 758 - 17. 772 and 38. 021 - 38. 061, respectively). For both series, a CO 2 -rich potassic metasomatized lithospheric mantle enriched the source with rutile-bearing phlogopite clinopyroxenite veins. Kamafugite-like parental magma is attributed to the high-Ca series with major contributions from the melting of the veins. Potassic nephelinite-like parental magma is assigned to the low-Ca series, where the metasomatized wall-rock played a more significant role in the melting process...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Calzirtite, {{essentially}} CaTiZraO 0, {{has been}} identified in residual soils from the Bukusu carbonatite complex in Uganda. A satisfactory ultrasonic tech-nique was developed for cleaning the samples prior to studying their mineralogy. Other heavy minerals present include ilmenite, perovskite, <b>melanite,</b> apatite, zircon, and baddeleyite. The properties and composition of calzirtite are compared with the available data from occurrences in the U. S. S. R. The mineral has a metasomatic paragencsis and probably indicates the presence of carbonatized rocks at depth. T HE rare calcium titano-zirconate calzirtite has been discovered in eluvial soils derived from the Bukusu carbonatite complex in south-eastern Uganda. Calzirtite has previously been described from at least three localities in the U. S. S. R. and from a complex in Brazil, but its occurrence at Bukusu seems to represent the first reported dis-covery of the mineral anywhere in Africa (Baldock, 1967). The mineral was identified at several localities within the complex during a detailed reinvestigation of Bukusu undertaken for the Geological Survey of Uganda and later as a research project at Leeds University.
