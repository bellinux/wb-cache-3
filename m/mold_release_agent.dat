One template was a Millapore Isopore polycarbonate membrane filter and the other template was an n-type silicon wafer processed to include four different pore diameters. These pore diameters were 20, 40, 80, and 160 microns. AutoCAD was used to design to a mask to be used later during photolithography. Two n-type wafers were sputtered with aluminum, underwent photolithography, and then etched using reactive ion etching. A template was placed into a Petri dish and Sylgard 184 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was poured on the template. Once the PDMS cured, the 1 mm slab of PDMS gecko tape was sliced into 20 mm x 20 mm samples. Micrographs of the gecko tape processed using the Isopore filters revealed hairs that were 5 µm in diameter and 20 µm in height. The hairs were also dispersed, and sporadically oriented; some hairs being erected but most were lying down. Using a thinner Isopore filter will produce PDMS gecko tape with micro-hairs that will stand straight up. About 99 % of the micro-hairs of the gecko tape processed using the silicon wafer templates failed to peel out of the pores. The possible causes for the failed peel out were thermal mechanical lock between the PDMS micro-hairs and silicon pores, incorrect application of <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> and the <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> Jerseycote, did not provide an adequate release layer.

Regarding ink-jetting performance, small droplet ink-jetting of 0. 7 pl was successfully demonstrated by adjusting the resist fluid property to the ink-jet coater and controlling the resist volatilization. Regarding pattern formability, a resist pattern was imprinted from a mold pattern of 28 nm in width and 60 nm in depth without pattern dimension change. It was thought that modulus control of the resist {{was more important than}} resist shrinkage in achieving excellent pattern formability.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 A {{composite}} material {{is composed of}} fibers embedded in a matrix and is called Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP). Particularly, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) has carbon fiber as the reinforcement. It has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is not less susceptible to fatigue or corrosion compared to metallic materials. Therefore, {{composite material}}s like CFRP find applications in aerospace industry due to their low weight and advanced mechanical properties. For large scale composite structures, smaller parts often need to be connected together. The connection of these parts could be done either by mechanical joints such as fasteners or by gluing them together using adhesives. This research focuses on bonded composite structures. A prevailing problem in bonded joints is the indeterminate nature {{of the strength of}} the adhesive bond. Low strength bonds, i. e., weak bonds, are very difficult to detect and may become the cause of catastrophic failure. Hence, this work aims to develop a technique based on highly nonlinear waves called solitary waves to detect weak bonds. Nonlinear solitary waves can be generated in a 1 -D chain of granular crystals, which consists of discrete particles having nonlinear interactions. Solitary waves are high energy packets, which maintain a finite spatial width while traveling. These waves, traveling in the granular chain, can be transmitted into the specimen by making direct contact with the chain. The reflected wave pattern from the specimen can give information about the localized stiffness of the specimen. In this study, two kinds of CFRP specimens are fabricated - one with pristine bond and the other with a weak bond. For making a weak bond specimen, <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is used to coat the surface of CFRP laminate prior to bonding. This coating acts as an impurity at the bondline and is an example of poor surface preparation. First, standard tests such as the three point bending and the end notched flexure tests are conducted to demonstrate that the strength of the bond is reduced due to the presence of the release agent coating. Further, impact test by solitary wave injection is conducted to cause weak bonds to develop delamination and obtain the response of solitary waves reflected from the specimens. We study the reflected wave characteristics for weak bond detection. Two cases are considered; in the first case, two specimens - pristine and weak bond samples, both without having an initial crack - are tested. In the second case, two specimens - pristine and weak bond samples, both with an initial crack - are tested. The results differentiate the weak bond with the pristine bond based on reflected wave characteristics. This study shows promising results indicating the potential of solitary wave-based detection of weak bond for hot spot monitoring of composite-based structures...|$|E

40|$|Adhesive bonding of {{composite}} materials requires reliable monitoring and detection of surface contaminants to assure robust and durable bonded structures. Surface treatment and effective monitoring prior to bonding {{is essential in}} order to obtain a surface free from contaminants that may degrade structural performance. Two techniques which monitor the effectiveness of the laser surface treatment of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials are being investigated: laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and optically stimulated electron emission (OSEE). The applicability of LIBS to detect silicone contaminants on CFRP composites is studied using ~ 35 ns Nd:YAG laser pulses at 355 nm with a pulse energy of 45 mJ. The LIBS regime in which pulse energies are < 100 mJ is referred to as mLIBS. CFRP surfaces were contaminated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a major component of silicone based <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents.</b> The presence of PDMS is found by inspecting the Si I emission line at 288. 2 nm.

40|$|In {{the serial}} {{production}} of components for automotive {{applications such as}} cooling and air-conditioning systems, aluminum die-cast materials are frequently used due to their excellent castability. The aim of providing light weight components can be approached with thin walled cross sections even for complex structural parts. However, cast components are usually connected to semifinished products such as profiles or tubes. The connections have to be mostly pressure tight. The joining technique for these applications has to be highly productive to obtain high component outcome and cost-efficient. Laser beam welding techniques are especially suitable for these tasks. Die-cast components have limited or no weldability due to their manufacturing process. This is due to entrapped gases within pores or cavities under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, the <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> for the die-cast process are inappropriate for obtaining homogeneous and sound weld seams. Consequently, {{this results in a}} larger number of pores in the weld seam and stochastic melt pool blow-outs, which prohibit mostly the use of the component. To solve these issues, a new welding technique, remoweld®T, has been developed at Fraunhofer IWS. This unique method has been extensively tested and used for serial-production. The decisive step was to use laser sources with brilliant beam quality in combination with a high frequency beam oscillation within the melt pool. In this paper, the technological approach will be presented. With the remoweld®T method, it was possible to obtain homogeneous weld seams with low porosity and a strongly reduced distortion for the first time.

By means of partial-filling UV-NIL, we successfully fabricated ARS films with excellent performance up to 75 th imprint compared to complete-filling UV-NIL up to the 40 th imprint...|$|R
