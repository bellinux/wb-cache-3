40|$|A {{magnetic}} filter {{system has been}} constructed, and its performance has been investigated, to measure the magnetic property of monodisperse γ -Fe 2 O 3 particles in the size range from 100 to 300 nm. In the system, SS 430 screens are placed in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> and exposed to a strong external magnetic field generated by an electric coil. The high magnetic field gradient resulted frommagnetized fine wires enhances the collection of magnetic particles {{in addition to the}} particle collection via the diffusion mechanism. The particle concentrations at the upstream and downstream of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> were measured by an Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter (UCPC, TSI model 3025 A). Particle penetration obtained in the experiment is a function of particle size, particle magnetic property, and wire magnetization. To retrieve the magnetic property of characterized particles from the measured penetration data, a numerical model was further developed using the finite element package COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 5. In this modeling, a single mesh screen is assumed to be represented by unit cells. The flow, the magnetic fields, and particle trajectory were solved in a unit cell. The relationship between particle penetration and magnetic property can then be obtained via this model for the given particle size, aerosol flowrate, and external magnetic field strength. The numerical model was first validated by comparing the experimental penetration with the simulation results for the case of 100, 150, and 250 nm γ -Fe 2 O 3 particles having the magnetic susceptibility characterized by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic susceptibilities of other sizes from 100 to 300 nm were then derived from this model according to the measured penetration data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCapture of {{micron-sized}} magnetic particles on high gradient magnetic separators {{has been}} studied for decades in view of broad applications to ore benefication and to magnetic separation of biological cells. Filtration of magnetic nanoparticles, as small as 10 - 20 nm in diameter, is often considered as practically irrelevant because of the weakness of magnetic interactions as compared to Brownian effects. We propose to use nanoparticles combined with microparticles to remove pollutants from water. The nanoaparticles which present a large surface area adsorb the pollutants and the microparticles attract the nanoparticles under an external magnetic field. So we can separate the purified water from the waste water containing the two sizes magnetic particles with pollutants. After washed these particles can be re-use for another purification cycle.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system.
