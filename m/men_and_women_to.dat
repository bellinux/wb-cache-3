Islam requires both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>to</b> dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments.

It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
