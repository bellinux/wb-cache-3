Since raw <b>meat</b> <b>ball</b> is made from raw ground beef and consumed without cooking, it can be a risk factor for the consumers in terms of foodborne infections and toxications.

Central nervous system tissues such as brain and spinal cord which are classified as specified risk materials (SRMs) are regarded to be main source of infection. The contamination of the meat with the specific risk materials (SRMs) can occur in phases of slaughter, fragmentation of carcass and processing. This study was conducted in order to investigate the existence of CNS tissues in raw <b>meat</b> <b>ball</b> (cig kofte) which is commonly consumed in the Southeastern Region of Turkey, particularly in &# 350;anl&# 305;urfa.
