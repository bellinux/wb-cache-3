40|$|As {{traditional}} {{oil and gas}} deposits dwindle, non-traditional <b>marginal</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are being}} exploited to further economical and industrial needs worldwide. These reserves are often far from civilization, deep in the sea or in regions such as the Arctic. Now, more than ever, risks related to transporting oil and gas products need to be determined in these remote and sensitive ecological areas. Continuous monitoring of subsea pipelines {{is the best way}} to detect leaks quickly and prevent/minimize damage. A number of systems and technologies exist for this purpose. The present work describes two analytical approaches to making decisions related to best technology selection. The first is selecting the best available technology through researching desired parameters and conducting objective analysis. The second approach uses a risk-based methodology for identifying the best technology. The key focus of the present work is to develop a method to quantify uncertainties involved with leak detection technologies on subsea arctic pipelines applicable to harsh environments and use the quantified uncertainty in decision making. This thesis presents both approaches in detail and discusses their application to a real-life case study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{interdependence}} between central bank and commercial bank goals. The basic central bank task is to achieve and to maintain price stability. Croatian external debt has been increasing for years and so {{the activities of the}} Croatian National Bank are designed to correct this situation. In order to stop the further increase of the external debt, the Croatian National Bank uses several monetary policy instruments, among which is the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement. On the other hand, the goal of commercial banks is to maximise profits. Banks take loans from abroad at a lower interest rate and invest this money in Croatia at a higher interest rate, thus fulfilling their goal. In order to obtain the desired effects of the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement, its optimal percentage value should be determined. This problem is modelled as a bi-level mixed 0 - 1 programming problem. The objective of the leader (Croatian National Bank) is to minimize the increase in household loans by setting different percentages of the reserve requirements for loans extended to households and for those granted to enterprises. The objective of the followers (banks) is to maximize profits. In order to solve this NP-hard problem a heuristic is proposed. In order to verify the model, the paper ends with simulations and the presentation of computational results. monetary policy instruments, commercial banks credit activity, <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement, bi-level mixed 0 - 1 programming problem, NP-hard problem, heuristic...|$|E

Although quantitative analysis is complicated by substantial overlaps among measures, the econometric results in this paper suggest that the measures were most effective in requiring banks to hold high liquidity and capital buffers, and less effective in slowing credit growth and capital inflows. Larger buffers seem to have helped Croatian banks weather the financial crisis, making the adjustments to capital and liquidity during the crisis smaller.

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} a panel dataset comprising 1, 565 {{banks in}} 20 emerging countries during 1989 - 2001 and compares {{the response of}} the volume of loans and the rates on loans and deposits to various measures of monetary conditions across domestic and foreign banks. It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks during periods of financial distress and tranquil times. Using differences in bank ownership as a proxy for financial constraints, the paper finds weak evidence that foreign banks have a lower sensitivity of credit to monetary conditions relative to their domestic competitors, with the differences driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. The lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to be smoother during periods of financial distress. However, the differences across domestic and foreign banks {{do not appear to be}} strong. These results provide weak support to the existence of supply-side effects in credit markets and suggest that foreign bank entry in emerging countries may have contributed somewhat to stability in credit markets.

40|$|The {{manner in}} which governments charge mineral {{resource}} producers {{has been the subject}} of considerable debate. In particular, there is a continuing debate about whether royalties should be reduced or eliminated, the preferred alternative then being some variant of an income-based charge such as a resource rent tax, a policy adopted in Norway, the United Kingdom and Australia. The argument for avoiding royalties is based on analyses demonstrating that royalties and other quantity-based charges distort production decisions and lead to outcomes such as high-grading and premature mine closure. We argue that it is inappropriate to infer that royalties are inefficient from the perspective of the resource owner (typically a government on behalf of society). Rather, the royalty serves a key pricing purpose and should be interpreted as the capital loss on the resource owner's balance sheet from extracting <b>marginal</b> <b>reserves.</b> We demonstrate this result under various conditions of uncertainty and informational asymmetry, using an incentive-based framework which enables us to highlight the separation of asset ownership from asset use.

40|$|The Peruvian {{financial}} system is highly dollarized {{with more than}} 50 per cent of deposits held in dollars. The structure and operation of the payment system reflect this financial dollarization. Not only does it settle payments in local and foreign currency, but the Intraday Financial Facility (IFF), through which the Central Bank provides liquidity to assure the uninterrupted operation of the payment system, reflects as well the {{financial system}} dollarization. Thus, due to the high dollar composition of deposits in the financial system, banks keep large amounts of dollar liquidity at the Central Bank, so as to meet the <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement of 30 per cent, while the lower soles share of deposits {{as well as the}} minimum requirement to maintain 1 per cent deposited at the Central Bank, makes the soles liquidity of banks insufficient to settle all the transactions undertaken by the payment system, which for the most part are carried out in local currency, in spite of the financial dollarization. This situation leads the banks to utilize the IFF by means mainly of foreign currency swaps, given the ample availability of dollar liquidity. Nevertheless, the gradual dedollarization and the increasing bankarization are reducing the need to utilize the IFF. It is worth noting that at present not only foreign currency liquidity but also the holdings of Central Bank and Government securities are ensuring that the financial system is able {{to make use of the}} IFF and have the excess liquidity in order to settle total payments, both in local and foreign currency, thus enabling the payment system to run smoothly and efficiently.

It includes only the estimated helium contained in fields and formations from which helium {{is currently being}} recovered. The Cliffside Gasfield {{is expected to continue}} to be used to deliver the helium needed to meet worldwide demand. Figure 6 shows the possible demand, using set criteria, for the helium stored in the Cliffside Gasfield to meet helium sales. The identified helium resources of the United States are estimated at 449 Bcf as of December 31, 2002. This includes 131 Bcf of demonstrated reserves, 132 Bcf of demonstrated <b>marginal</b> <b>reserves,</b> and 37 Bcf of demonstrated subeconomic resources. The identified resources also include 149 Bcf of helium in inferred subeconomic resources. The demonstrated helium resources contained on Federal lands are approximately 150 Bcf, including 29 Bcf in underground storage in the Cliffside Gasfield near Amarillo, Texas. In addition to the identified helium resources, undiscovered helium resources in the United States are estimated at a most likely volume of 108 Bcf, with a maximum volume of 292 Bcf and a minimum volume of 44 Bcf. Also reported are 56 Bcf of helium in nonconventional and low helium content natural gases. Current extraction of helium in the United States occurs mostly from natural gases produced from the Hugoton gas area in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, and the Riley Ridge area in southwestern Wyoming. Helium extracted from natural gas in the United States in 2002 was approximately 3. 1 Bcf, with additional production of stored helium from the Cliffside Gasfield of 1. 4 Bcf. The volume of helium produced with the natural gas in the Hugoton gas area continues to decline. The trend continues to be the withdrawal from the Cliffside Gasfield of privately owned crude helium by private industry. The open market sale of the Government’s helium initiated in 2003 allows for the transfer of the Government owned helium to private industry. The helium sales from the mid-continent remained basically flat from 2000 to 2002. The helium market has not grown at the recent historical rates of 5. 7 percent annually from 1995 to 2000. The helium sales forecast for the future is not clear at this time. Additional helium is expected to come into the market from plants in Algeria and Qatar during 2005.

40|$|The {{prospects}} of expansionary monetary {{policies in the}} advanced countries {{for the foreseeable future}} have renewed the debate over policy options to cope with large capital inflows that are, at least partly, driven by low interest rates in the financial centers. Historically, capital flow bonanzas have often fueled sharp credit expansions in advanced and emerging market economies alike. Focusing primarily on emerging markets, we analyze the impact of exchange rate flexibility on credit markets during periods of large capital inflows. We show that bank credit grows more rapidly and its composition tilts to foreign currency in economies with less flexible exchange rate regimes, and that these results are not explained entirely {{by the fact that the}} latter attract more capital inflows than economies with more flexible regimes. Our findings thus suggest countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes may stand to benefit the most from regulatory policies that reduce banks'' incentives to tap external markets and to lend/borrow in foreign currency; these policies include <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements on foreign lending, currency-dependent liquidity requirements, and higher capital requirement and/or dynamic provisioning on foreign exchange loans.

40|$|International investors' enthusiasm {{with respect}} to growth {{prospects}} in Southeast Asia has been followed by panic. Both the outstanding economic performance of Southeast Asian economies {{and their ability to}} master adjustment challenges had led most observers of these economies to the conclusion that "Asia is different". In comparison with previous currency crises, the macroeconomic fundamentals (GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, external indebtedness, domestic savings, export performance) in the Southeast Asian economies seemed to be consistent with the fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Even large current account deficits were not classified as "high risk" although the vulnerability of Southeast Asian countries had increased during the last decade due to a surge in capital inflows, a construction boom, the appreciation of the US dollar, and the liberalization of domestic financial markets without strict enforcement of prudential standards. Early signals of vulnerability should have warned domestic policymakers to take precautionary measures such as more exchange rate flexibility to end sterilization policies, higher <b>marginal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, and prudential standards for bank lending to reduce the risk exposure of banks. Some of these measures were taken in 1996, but apparently it was too little or too late. In the aftermath of the crisis, the enforcement of prudential rules in the financial sector and the clearing of bad debt figure high on the policy agenda. In order to help financial restructuring, fiscal and monetary policies should not be overly restrictive. The role of external assistance is ambiguous because of negative incentive effects. The currency crises in Asia boosted the amounts of emergency lending by the IMF and other countries, which may raise expectations that defaults will become cheaper in the future. Moreover, officially implemented early warning systems may easily produce the bad news which triggers exchange rate crises. All in all, Asia is not different from other regions. High current account deficits and real appreciation expose countries with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rates and fragile domestic financial markets to the risk of a reversal of capital inflows. This mounting risk position can lead to a crisis when bad news arrives and domestic measures are delayed. Therefore, Asia could have learned from previous currency crises in Latin America and Europe: first, extreme solutions for the exchange rate regime (currency boards or a passive crawling peg with wide intervention bands) work best; second, deregulated goods and factor markets with strict prudential supervision (especially in the phase of financial liberalization) are necessary preconditions for a stable fixed exchange rate regime; third, development models with discretionary government interventions face difficult times since the globalization of goods and factor markets renders economic plans of today obsolete tomorrow.

A 3 -column mini TLP is designed and its platform-mooring coupled dynamic behaviour is investigated and compared with an existing 4 -column mini TLP. The numerical investigation is carried out for the 1 : 56 scaled model using a finite element computer program suitable for compliant offshore platforms. A combination wave force model with diffraction-radiation loading on large members and Morison loading on slender members is adopted for computing the non-linear dynamic response of the structure. The effects of parameters such as pretension in tethers and wave approach angle have been studied. The results obtained are compared with published results of the 4 -column mini TLP. It is found that the dynamic responses of the 3 -column mini TLP {{are close to the}} 4 -column mini TLP with relatively higher surge and tether tension. Accounting for this in the design stage, the newly designed structure could be a promising candidate which can be used {{as an alternative to the}} 4 -column mini TLP. Reducing the number of columns from four to three has added advantages in terms of cost and time during fabrication, installation and maintenance of the platform...|$|R
40|$|A site {{which had}} {{previously}} carried {{a high quality}} Eucalyptus regnans F. Mueller forest, but which had <b>marginal</b> soil nutrient <b>reserves,</b> was selected to trial four fertiliser options for establishment of Eucalyptus nitens (Dean et Maiden) Maiden andii. regnans sawlog plantations. Apart from the fertiliser options, current operational plantation establishment practices were used. Application of a nitrogen-phosphorus fertiliser shortly after planting produced increased growth for E. nitens amounting to 30 m 3 /ha by age 7 years. Eucalyptus regnans also responded to fertiliser application, but overall growth was {{less than half that}} of the E. nitens. This slower growth was due to early severe and repeated insect attacks. Insect attack also caused increased double and multiple leadering in the E. regnans. Normal rates of nitrogen-phosphorus fertiliser application (25 g N and 11 g P/tree) resulted in an increase in branch size compared with trees without fertiliser, and the mean largest branch diameter was increased by 6 mm for E. nitens. Multiple leadering also increased, from 2 % to 10 %. Very high rates of fertiliser addition over the first 6 month...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2010 China’s foreign {{exchange}} reserve reached $ 2847. 34 billion, the author designs the maximum government utility function when consider the China government buys a part {{foreign exchange}} if company earns, {{it means that the}} China government will increase Ren-Min-Bi Yuan. And it will cause inflation. The inflation will cause disutility to government. Finally it gets the optimal fuction. VAR Regress finds the fitted value and actual value of foreign exchange reserves is nearly equal within 99. 8 %. The thesis gets the long term equilibrium relation of the nature logarithm of variables by VEC model, which are foreign exchange reserves, standard error of export, marginal propensity to import, the opportunity cost for foreign exchange <b>reserves,</b> <b>marginal</b> output to export. Using the sample datas in China 1980 - 2006 and VEC, we can find that (1) the government-holding foreign exchange reserves has positive correlation with the export standard error, (2) the government-holding foreign exchange reserves has positive correlation with the marginal propensity to import. The data and regression method are all different, but all have the positive correlation between the foreign exchange reserves and export standard error...|$|R
40|$|One of the unmet {{clinical}} {{needs in}} heart surgery is {{the prevention of}} myocardial stunning and necrosis that {{occurs as a result}} of ischemia-reperfusion. Myocardial stunning, a frequent consequence after heart surgery, is characterized by a requirement for postoperative inotropic support despite a technically satisfactory heart operation. In high-risk patients with <b>marginal</b> cardiac <b>reserve,</b> stunning is a major cause of prolonged critical care and may be associated with as much as a 5 -fold increase in mor-tality. In contrast, the frequency of myocardial necrosis (myocardial infarction [MI]) after cardiac surgery is less appreciated and its consequences are much more subtle. The consequences may not be apparent for months to years. While we now have a much better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial stunning and MI, we still have no effective way to prevent these complications, nor a consistently effective means to engage the well-studied endogenous mechanisms of car-dioprotection. The failure to develop clinically effective interventions is multifactorial and can be attributed to reliance on find-ings obtained from subcellular and cellular studies, to drawing conclusions from preclinical large animal studies that have been conducted in a disease-free state, and to accepting less than robust surrogate markers of injury in phase II clinical trials. These factors also explain the disappointing failure to identify effective adjuvant therapy in the setting of percutaneous coronary revascularization for acute MI (AMI) and reperfusion injury. These issues have contributed to the disappointing outcomes of large and costly phase III trials, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm {{on the part of the}} pharmaceutical industry to engage in fur-ther drug development for this indication. The purpose of this review is to (1) define the scope of the clinical problem; (2) summarize the outcomes of selected phases II and III clinical trials; and (3) identify the gap that needs to be closed in order to address the unmet clinical need.

40|$|Under a {{flexible}} exchange rate regime international reserves contribute to {{reducing the risk of}} a financial crisis, and allow the monetary authority to exceptionally intervene in the exchange market. However, holding reserves is costly. In this paper, we analyze several issues concerning the adequate level of Chilean international reserves. In the first place, we compare the level of Chile’s international reserves with those of different sets of countries using various indicators. We then analyze empirically some of the benefits and costs of holding reserves. Our results show that Chile’s international reserves are high when measured with respect to GDP or M 2, but they are in line with those of countries of similar characteristics when measured as a fraction of short-term residual debt. On the other hand, given the low risk of the Chilean economy, <b>marginal</b> changes in <b>reserves</b> have a very low impact on both the probability of a financial crisis and the sovereign spread of the country. Finally, as the sovereign spread has decreased over the last years, so too has the cost of reserves. In fact, by the end of 2002, and despite having a high reserves-to-GDP ratio, the cost of reserves as a fraction of GDP was considerably lower than the cost of other emerging economies. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vitamin A is an {{essential}} nutrient during pregnancy and throughout the lifecycle due to {{its role in the}} development of critical organ systems. Because maternal tissue is progressively depleted of vitamin A to supply fetal demands, women who become pregnant while possessing <b>marginal</b> vitamin A <b>reserves</b> are at increased risk of vitamin A inadequacy as pregnancy progresses. Few studies have assessed the relationship between socioeconomic factors and retinol status in women of childbearing age. Methods: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess the relationship between serum retinol concentrations and socioeconomic factors in women of childbearing age. Women 14 – 45 years of age (n = 3170) from NHANES cycles 2003 – 2004 and 2005 – 2006 were included. Serum retinol concentrations were divided into categories according to World Health Organization criteria. All statistical procedures accounted for the weighted data and complex design of the NHANES sample. A p-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The poverty score and race were significantly associated with vitamin A status after adjustment for confounders. Odds of retinol concentrations of < 1. 05 µmol/L were 1. 85 times higher for those of lower socioeconomic status when compared to those of higher status (95 % CI: 1. 12 – 3. 03, p = 0. 02), and 3. 1 times higher for non-Hispanic blacks when compared to non-Hispanic whites (95 % CI: 1. 50 – 6. 41, p = 0. 002). Dietary intakes of retinol activity equivalents were significantly lower in groups with higher poverty scores (p = 0. 004). Conclusion There appear to be disparities in serum vitamin A levels in women of childbearing age related to income and race in the United States...|$|R
