The {{acoustic field}} in the cavity is coupled to the unstable shear layer {{at the mouth of}} the cavity. Flow visualization revealed that the flow in the shear layer is characterized by periodic formation of large-scale vortices and convection of these vortices downstream to the trailing edge. A LDV system was utilized to measure the periodic changes in the shear layer flow. A two step data analysis process was used to reconstruct the velocity field. The process consisted of phase conditioned averaging and a Fourier series approximation...|$|R

40|$|Study on {{supersonic}} flow over wall <b>mounted</b> <b>cavities</b> with different ramp angles {{is carried out}} experimentally.

Cavity with ramp angle of 45 degrees is found to reduce the amplitude of oscillations and the presence of acoustic wave inside the cavity was not detected. Increase in amplitudes has been observed from cavities with ramp angle 30 and 15 degrees. The presence of wave system having velocity greater than acoustic velocity was detected in cavity with 30 degree ramp angle while no presence of acoustic wave was detected in the case of cavity with ramp angle of 15 degrees. The reasons for this ambiguous behavior could not be ascertained. Temporal mode switching occurring in cavities with higher ramp angles was confirmed by spectrogram studies...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} model was {{developed}} to solve for the acoustic pressure and energy fields in a heterogeneous suppressor. The derivations from the governing equations assumed that the material properties could vary with position resulting in a heterogeneous variable property two-dimensional wave equation. This eliminated the necessity of finding the boundary conditions between different materials. For a two media region consisting of part air and part bulk absorber, a model was {{used to describe the}} bulk absorber properties in two directions. Complex metallic structures inside the air duct are simulated by simply changing element properties from air to the structural material in a pattern to describe the desired shapes. To verify the numerical theory, experiments were conducted without flow in a rectangular duct with a single folded <b>cavity</b> <b>mounted</b> above the duct and absorbing material <b>mounted</b> inside a <b>cavity.</b> Changes in a nearly plane wave sound field were measured on the wall opposite the absorbing cavity.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} passive-venting system to modify the flow field characteristics of a rectangular-box cavity at supersonic speeds. The passive-venting system consists of a porous floor with a vent chamber beneath the floor. For certain cavity length-to-height ratios, this configuration allowed high-pressure air {{at the rear of the}} cavity to vent to the forward part of the cavity, thereby modifying the cavity flow field. The wind-tunnel model consisted of a flat plate that housed a <b>cavity</b> <b>mounted</b> on a balance such that only the cavity drag was measured. The cavity height remained constant, and the length varied with rectangular-block inserts. Both solid-and porous-floor cavities were tested for comparison at Mach numbers of 1. 60, 1. 90, 2. 16, and 2. 86. These results showed that the passive-venting system did modify the cavity flow field. In order to determine the type flow field which existed for the porous-floor configuration, pressures were measured inside the cavity at the same conditions and for the same configurations as those used in the drag tests.

The paper briefly reviews the benefit of embedding for ultra-thin dies in terms of mechanical robustness. For the technological demonstration, we used 25 μm thin microcontroller IC and 50 μm polyimide film substrates. Electrical interconnections were realized by sputtering of metal layers. Photolithography was performed on “wafer level” using aligner photomasks and a photo-sensitive polymer of 10 μm thickness for embedding. The embedding process resulted in a mechanically flexible fan-out chip package of a thickness below 100 μm. Perspectives and technological requirements for roll-to-roll manufacture as well as cost estimation for this kind of Thin Chip Foil Package are explained and discussed. Furthermore, we report our recent work on the development of an in-situ bending and electrical test equipment for flexible film modules.
