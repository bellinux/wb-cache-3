5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, <b>multivalent</b> atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E

Genetica, 82 (2), 103 - 110 The chromosomes {{of the two}} closely related diploid species, Gibasis consobrina and G. karwinskyana (Commelinaceae; 2 n= 2 x= 10), are morphologically alike, yet form few chiasmate associations at metaphase I in the f 1 hybrid.

The F 1 hybrid between different tetraploid genotypes of the same two species similarly forms <b>multivalents</b> during meiotic prophase, which are subsequently eliminated in favour of strictly homologous bivalents before metaphase I. One quadrivalent comprising interchange chromosomes inherited from one of the parents, usually persists to first metaphase.

50|$|Normally, {{homologous}} chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes {{are present in}} the nucleus, homeologous chromosomes can also pair with {{homologous chromosomes}} resulting in the formation of trivalents or <b>multivalents</b> (4).

25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} <b>multivalent</b> cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of <b>multivalent</b> cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of genetic linkage maps in polyploid species {{has been a}} long-standing problem for which various approaches have been proposed. In the case of autopolyploids, a commonly used simplification is that random bivalents form during meiosis. This leads to relatively straightforward estimation of recombination frequencies using maximum likelihood, from which a genetic map can be derived. However, autopolyploids such as tetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) may exhibit additional features, such as double reduction, not normally encountered in diploid or allopolyploid species. In this study, we produced a high-density linkage map of tetraploid potato {{and used it to}} identify regions of double reduction in a biparental mapping population. The frequency of <b>multivalents</b> required to produce this degree of double reduction was determined through simulation. We also determined the effect that <b>multivalents</b> or preferential pairing between homologous chromosomes has on linkage mapping. Low levels of <b>multivalents</b> or preferential pairing do not adversely affect map construction when highly informative marker types and phases are used. We reveal the double-reduction landscape in tetraploid potato, clearly showing that this phenomenon increases with distance from the centromeres. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromosomes}} {{involved in}} twenty reciprocal translocations in G. hirsutum were reidentified {{by means of}} a specially designed crossing program. Each translocation line was crossed to appropriate monosomic, monotelodisomic, and/or translocation lines. The F₁ hybrids were then scored cytologically to verify the original chromosome identification. These twenty reciprocal translocations now become the cytogenetic tester set for G. hirsutum. Seed stocks for each verified translocation line will be maintained at, and distributed by, the University of Arizona. Nineteen of the twenty heterozygous translocations had a modal chiasma frequency per quadrivalent of four. Fourteen of these translocation lines formed predominantly ring <b>multivalents</b> at MI, and the remaining five translocations usually formed <b>multivalents</b> with at least one interstitial chiasma. One translocation line, which was originally produced by an interspecies cross, formed predominantly chains at MI. This increased amount of chaining in the quadrivalent is probably the result of interspecific chromosome material within the translocation reducing the chiasma frequency. The orientation of the centromeres in quadrivalents is influenced {{by the size of the}} chromosomes involved in the reciprocal translocation, and the constraints imposed by the chiasmata within the chromosome arms. Ten of the twenty reciprocal translocations studied formed predominantly alternate orientations at MI. Eight of these ten translocation lines were reciprocal translocations between two A subgenome chromosomes. This suggests that the large A subgenome chromosomes allow the quadrivalent to be more flexible, resulting in easy reorientation to the stable alternate configuration. Proximal chiasma formation influences the orientation and probable involvement of the homologous centromeres in spindle formation. Lines in which a high frequency of <b>multivalents</b> with interstitial chiasma were observed had a significantly lower frequency of <b>multivalents</b> with either one or two centromeres not involved in spindle formation of 3 : 1 orientations. In most of the heterozygous translocations, identification of each chromosome within the quadrivalent at MI was not possible.

Of these, two allopatric populations of A. humbertianus and two of 0. nitidula were chosen for intraspecies interpopulation. al studies. Both aneuploidy and polyploidy were encountered as intraindividual variations. Two kinds of polyploid cells—one with and another without <b>multivalents</b> —were found to occur. The former signified the occurrence of premeiotic mitotic breakdown of spindle whereas the latter {{was due to the}} failure of cytokinesis. While many tetraploid cells without <b>multivalents</b> successfully consummated meiosis producing dimegalous spermatids, tetraploid cells with <b>multivalents</b> and higher polyploids degenerated without completing meiosis.

25|$|Autopolyploids possess {{at least}} three {{homologous}} chromosome sets, {{which can lead to}} high rates of <b>multivalent</b> pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, a.k.a. neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of aneuploid gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring bivalent pairing during meiosis, but the high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or allopolyploid, these categories represent the ends of a spectrum between of divergence between parental subgenomes. Polyploids that fall between these two extremes, which are often referred to as segmental allopolyploids, may display intermediate levels of polysomic inheritance that vary by locus.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} forms of galectin structure: dimeric, tandem or chimera. Dimeric galectins, also called prototypical galectins, are homodimers, consisting of two identical galectin subunits that have associated with one another. The galectins that fall under this category are galectin-1, -2, -5, -7, -10, -11, -13, -14 and -15. Tandem galectins contain at least two distinct carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) within one polypeptide, thus are considered intrinsically divalent. The CRDs are linked with a small peptide domain. Tandem galectins include galectin-4, -6, -8, -9 and -12. The final galectin is galectin-3 {{which is the only}} galectin found in the chimera category in vertebrates. Galectin-3 has one CRD and a long non-lectin domain. Galectin-3 can exist in monomeric form or can associate via the non-lectin domain into <b>multivalent</b> complexes up to a pentameric form. This allows galectin-3 to bridge effectively between different ligands and form adhesive networks. The formation of multimers is concentration dependent. When Galectin-3 is at a low concentration it is monomeric and likely to inhibit adhesion. It binds to adhesion proteins such as integrins and blocks further binding to other cells or the extracellular matrix. When concentrations of galectin-3 are high it forms large complexes that assist in adhesion by bridging between cells or cells and the extracellular matrix.|$|E
