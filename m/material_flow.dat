This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy.

5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E

The flow of material is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> field during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. <b>Material</b> <b>flow</b> calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications. Calculation of <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> fields in friction stir welding can be undertaken both using comprehensive numerical simulations or simple but insightful analytical equations. The comprehensive models for the calculation of <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> fields also provide important information such as geometry of the stir zone and the torque on the tool. The numerical simulations have shown the ability to correctly predict the results from marker experiments and the stir zone geometry observed in friction stir welding experiments.|$|E

40|$|A {{multitude}} of organisations with varying material needs are often involved in activities at project sites. This makes {{the use of}} collective project resources, like material handling resources at project sites, demanding. However, to ensure project success {{it is important that}} <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> needed to support activities undertaken at project sites are not disrupted as this can result in unnecessary costs and low customer service. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to analyse how <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> to and from project sites can be coordinated and how project characteristics might impact on how this is done. To do this, empirical data from a primarily qualitative case study undertaken at a Swedish exhibition centre used for multiple fairs has been collected. Findings illustrate how significant improvements can be achieved in the management of <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> to and from project sites if the material handling needs of the project participants are known in advance and the utilization of critical logistical resources is planned accordingly. The coordination of <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> for fairs are, however, impeded by fair characteristics like short project duration, heterogeneous <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> and fair diversity. Further research on coordination of <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> to and from project sites is suggested as the logistical problems observed in the studied case are likely to exist at other project sites with restricted access as well...|$|R

In the Soviet Union, waste stored in Lake Karachay was blown over the area during a dust storm after the lake had partly dried out. At Maxey Flat, a low-level radioactive waste facility located in Kentucky, containment trenches covered with dirt, instead of steel or cement, collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water. The water that invaded the trenches became radioactive {{and had to be}} disposed of at the Maxey Flat facility itself. In other cases of radioactive waste accidents, lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let <b>material</b> <b>flow</b> into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France, in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened; in one, at the Areva plant in Tricastin, it was reported that during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation.|$|E

The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons. Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface catalyst accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of <b>material</b> <b>flow.</b> Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at [...] would still be significant.|$|E

40|$|The key for the {{sustainable}} development is dematerialisation and ecoefficiency. Applied to agriculture ecoefficiency means production of nutritionally better food by using less inputs and {{by reducing the}} environmental burden. In restricting the material throughput {{it is essential to}} identify the most voluminous <b>material</b> <b>flows</b> and to direct the measures to them. Improving ecoefficiency of the food production requires that the benefits and the inputs are quantified in an unambiguous way and that the inputs are estimated for the whole production chain. A comprehensive view of the whole system is necessary. The food system comprises four mutually linked loops: 1) the plant production 2) the livestock husbandry, 3) the food processing industry and 4) the human consumption. In the present paper MFA approach has been used to describe the system. A general framework for estimating and balancing the <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> is outlined. The focus is on agriculture, specifically on the <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> created by the biological metabolism of the animal husbandry. The holistic MFA approach provides means to evaluate environmental and economic consequences of the production. For the decision-makers the MFA approach is a tool to guide the development and to assess the progress towards increasing ecoefficiency within the food system. The results can be used in developing new sustainability indicators. Some of the possibilities are shortly discussed.

40|$|The keen {{competition}} in industry puts {{a great deal}} of pressure upon all parts involved, and in addition to demands on the physical product, there are demands on the service aspects, such as an increased demand on the configuration of the delivered materials and their packaging, on throughput time, timeliness, and increased cost efficiency. The performance of the <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> systems, in which materials handling constitutes an important part, therefore plays a crucial part in the strive for competitive advantage. The materials handling function contributes to the adding of value when, for example, mixing articles, packaging them as demanded by the customer, or orienting and positioning them for a later process step, as well as influences cost efficiency and throughput time. This thesis deals with the relation between the resources required for the materials handling function and the design of <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> systems and is directed towards the development of a method for evaluation and improvement of <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> systems regarding the performance of the materials handling function. The development of a conceptual framework for the perspective of materials handling as contributing to the value added in <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> systems is included as an important basis. An improved understanding of the purpose of the materials handling function, as well as principles and procedures for how to utilise this knowledge to evaluate and improve the performance in terms of efficiency, is provided. The research was directed towards theory building, and a primarily inductive approach has been adopted, where the empirical data was gathered in ten case studies mainly within the manufacturing industry and warehousing. A method was developed which makes it possible to estimate, in an early design stage, the efficiency of the materials handling function, and to identify where along <b>materials</b> <b>flows</b> that changes in the <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> system design would give prerequisites for improvements. Further, the efficiency measurement has been utilised in a study aiming at relating the efficiency of the materials handling function to the process localisation {{in the context of the}} automotive industry and outsourcing. Additionally, the thesis includes a method for simultaneous evaluation of the materials handling efficiency and the physical work load generated in a <b>materials</b> <b>flow</b> system, the Work-Load Dose method...|$|R
