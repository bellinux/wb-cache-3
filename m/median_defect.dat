40|$|Purpose: Severe {{symptomatic}} {{and unstable}} osteochondral defects {{of the knee}} are difficult to treat. A variety of surgical techniques have been developed. However, the optimal surgical technique is still controversial. We present a novel technique in which autologous bone grafting is combined with gel-type autologous chondrocyte implantation (GACI). Methods: Isolated severe osteochondral defects of the medial or lateral femoral condyle were treated by a two-step procedure. Firstly, chondrocytes were harvested during arthroscopy and cultured for 6 weeks. Secondly, a full thickness corticospongious autologuos bone graft, harvested from the medial or lateral femur condyle, is impacted in the defect and covered by GACI. The fibrin gel fills up to the exact shape of the chondral lesion and polymerizes within 3 min after application. Results: From 2009 to 2011, 9 patients, median age 35 years (range 23 - 47), were treated by the combined autologous bone grafting and GACI technique. <b>Median</b> <b>defect</b> size was 7. 1 c...|$|E
40|$|Background Data {{on the use}} of {{biologic}} mesh in {{abdominal wall}} repair in complex cases remain sparse. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix for repair of complex contaminated abdominal wall defects. Methods Retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing abdominal wall repair with use of Strattice (TM) Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (LifeCell Corporation, Oxford, UK) between January 2011 and February 2015 at two National Intestinal Failure Units. Results Eighty patients were identified. Indications for abdominal wall repair included enterocutaneous fistula takedown (n = 50), infected synthetic mesh removal (n = 9), restoration of continuity or creation of a stoma with concomitant ventral hernia repair (n = 12), and others (n = 9). The <b>median</b> <b>defect</b> area was 143. 0 cm(2) (interquartile range or IQR 70. 0 - 256. 0 cm(2)). All had a grade III or IV hernia. Component separation technique (CST) was performed in 54 patients (68 %). Complete fascial closure was not possible despite CST and biologic mesh-assisted traction (bridged repair) in 20 patients (25 %). In-hospital mortality was 1 %. Thirty-six patients (45 %) developed a wound infection. None required mesh removal. Of 76 patients with a median clinical follow-up of 7 months (IQR 4 - 15) available for analysis, 10 patients (13 %) developed a hernia recurrence, of whom 3 had undergone bridged repairs. Seven patients developed a postoperative (recurrent) fistula (9 %). Conclusion Repair of challenging and contaminated abdominal wall defects can be done effectively with non-cross-linked biologic mesh and component separation technique without the need for mesh removal despite wound infection...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundVentricular septal defect (VSD) after acute {{myocardial}} infarction is a catastrophic event. AimsWe describe our multicentre experience of a defect closure strategy that combined surgery and transcatheter closure. MethodsData were obtained by retrospective chart review. ResultsTwenty patients (mean age, 67 years) from three centres were studied. Median time from {{myocardial infarction}} to VSD was 6 (range, 3 – 9) days. Acute cardiogenic shock occurred in 12 (60 %) patients. <b>Median</b> <b>defect</b> diameter by echocardiography was 18 (range, 12 – 28) mm. Median time to first surgical or percutaneous closure was 18 (range, 4 – 96) days. Twenty-seven procedures were performed in the 20 patients. Surgical closure was undertaken in 14 patients and contraindicated in eight, six of whom underwent percutaneous closure; the other two, after reconsideration, proceeded to surgical closure. No procedural complications occurred with percutaneous closure. Percutaneous closure patients were older than surgical patients (75 vs. 64 years; P= 0. 01) and had a higher mean logistic EuroSCORE (87 % vs. 67 %; P= 0. 02). Rates of residual shunt and mortality did not differ between surgical and percutaneous patients (P= 0. 12 and 0. 3, respectively). Those who underwent early VSD closure (< 21 days after myocardial infarction) had higher rates of residual shunt (P= 0. 09) and mortality (P= 0. 01), irrespective of closure strategy. The mortality rate was also higher after early percutaneous closure (P= 0. 001), but not after early surgery. Finally, predicted mortality (logistic EuroSCORE) was higher than hospital mortality (≤ 30 days) in our patient population (75 % vs. 30 %; P= 0. 01). ConclusionVigorous pursuit of closure of post-myocardial infarction VSD with a sequential surgical and/or percutaneous approach is recommended for improved outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The prone {{position}} is commonly utilized to reduce false positive perfusion defects because this position overcomes the diaphragmatic inferior wall attenuation in single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) studies. We investigated whether the {{prone position}} {{had an important}} advantage over the supine position in determining the severity and extent of infarct in patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: Twenty-nine male patients (mean age 61 ± 10 years) with acute inferior MI {{were enrolled in the}} cross-sectional study. After injection of thallium- 201 (201 Tl) under resting conditions, redistribution SPECT imaging was twicely performed in each subject, in both the supine and prone positions, consecutively. The extent and severity scores of the perfusion defects were calculated from the sum of individual segment scores. Myocardial infarction size was also evaluated using peak cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels. Wilcoxon rank and Spearman’s rank correlation tests were used for statistical analyses of data. Results: For the supine vs. prone positions, the <b>median</b> <b>defect</b> severity scores were 8 (4 - 13) vs. 5 (0. 5 - 8. 5) and the defect extent scores were 4 (3 - 5. 5) vs. 3 (0. 5 - 4. 5), respectively. Both perfusion defect scores in the prone position were significantly lower than those in the supine position (p< 0. 001). The mean peak cTnT level during hospitalization was 7. 2 ± 3. 9 μg/l. Peak cTnT levels were correlated with all SPECT parameters. However, the correlation was greater in the prone position (defect severity: r= 0. 712, p< 0. 001) (defect extent: r= 0. 790, p< 0. 001) than in the supine position (defect severity: r= 0. 495, p< 0. 01) (defect extent: r= 0. 481, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: In patients with inferior MI, the SPECT results revealed {{a significant difference between the}} supine and prone images. The perfusion extent and severity scores of SPECT in the inferior wall with prone imaging correlates better with the peak troponin compared to the supine position. Comparative studies that use advanced imaging tools are needed to verify our present findings...|$|E
40|$|Background Autologous {{chondrocyte}} implantation is a cell therapeutic {{approach for}} the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee joint. The authors previously reported on the histologic and radiologic outcome of autologous chondrocyte implantation in the short- to midterm, which yields mixed results. Purpose The objective is to report on the clinical outcome of autologous chondrocyte implantation for the knee in the midterm to long term. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods Eighty patients who had undergone autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee with mid- to long-term follow-up were analyzed. The mean patient age was 34. 6 years (standard deviation, 9. 1 years), with 63 men and 17 women. Seventy-one patients presented with a focal chondral defect, with a <b>median</b> <b>defect</b> area of 4. 1 cm 2 and a maximum defect area of 20 cm 2. The modified Lysholm score was used as a self-reporting clinical outcome measure to determine the following: (1) What is the typical pattern over time of clinical outcome after autologous chondrocyte implantation; and (2) Which patient-related predictors for the clinical outcome pattern can be used to improve patient selection for autologous chondrocyte implantation? Results The average follow-up time was 5 years (range, 2. 7 – 9. 3). Improvement in clinical outcome was found in 65 patients (81 %), while 15 patients (19 %) showed a decline in outcome. The median preoperative Lysholm score of 54 increased to a median of 78 points. The most rapid improvement in Lysholm score was over the 15 -month period after operation, after which the Lysholm score remained constant for up to 9 years. The authors were unable to identify any patient-specific factors (ie, age, gender, defect size, defect location, number of previous operations, preoperative Lysholm score) that could predict the change in clinical outcome in the first 15 months. Conclusion Autologous chondrocyte implantation seems to provide a durable clinical outcome in those patients demonstrating success at 15 months after operation. Comparisons between other outcome measures of autologous chondrocyte implantation should be focused on the clinical status at 15 months after surgery. The patient-reported clinical outcome at 15 months is a major predictor of the mid- to long-term success of autologous chondrocyte implantation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the difficulties and differing techniques in the transcatheter placement of amplatz ventricular septal defect devices to close perimembranous ventricular septal defects and place {{these in the}} context of the expanding literature on ventricular septal defect catheter closure. BACKGROUND: Surgery remains the established first-line therapy for closure of haemodynamically significant perimembranous ventricular septal defects. Transcatheter techniques appeared to promise a possible alternative, obviating the need for cardiac surgery. However, significant technical and anatomical constraints coupled with ongoing reports of a high incidence of heart block have prevented these hopes from being realised to any significant extent. It is likely that there are important methodological reasons for the high complication rates observed. The potential advantages of transcatheter perimembranous ventricular septal defect closure over surgery warrant further exploration of differing transcatheter techniques. METHODS: Between August, 2004 and November, 2009, 21 patients had a perimembranous ventricular septal defect closed with transcatheter techniques. Of these, 14 were closed with a muscular amplatz ventricular septal defect device. The median age and weight at device placement were 8 years, ranging from 2 to 19 years, and 18. 6 kilograms, ranging from 10 to 21 kilograms, respectively. RESULTS: There were 25 procedures performed on 23 patients using 21 amplatz ventricular septal defect devices. <b>Median</b> <b>defect</b> size on angiography was 7. 8 millimetres, ranging from 4 to 14. 3 millimetres, with a median device size of 8 millimetres, ranging from 4 to 18 millimetres, and a defect/device ratio of 1. 1, with a range from 0. 85 to 1. 33. Median procedure time was 100 minutes, with a range from 38 to 235 minutes. Adverse events included device embolisation following haemolysis in one, and new aortic incompetence in another, but there were no cases of heart block. Median follow-up was 41. 7 months, with a range from 2 to 71 months. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect using amplatz ventricular septal defect devices remains important, if a technically feasible method with low and acceptable complication rates is to be identified. Incidence of heart block may be minimised by avoiding oversized devices, using muscular devices, and accepting defeat if an appropriately selected device pulls through. Given the current transcatheter technologies, the closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects should generally be performed in children when they weigh at least 10 kilograms...|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} of 30 patients with frontoethmoidal encephaloceles {{was performed in}} order to find support for a proposed theory concerning its pathogenesis, based on a previously performed embryological study and relevant findings in the literature. According to this proposed theory the pathogenesis of frontoethmoidal encephaloceles is primarily based on a disturbance in separation of neural and surface ectoderm at the site of final closure of the rostral neuropore during the final phase of neurulation in the 4 th week of gestation. An insufficient occurrence of apoptosis might cause this disturbance in separation. The nonseparation of neural and surface ectoderm will result secondarily in a midline mesodermal defect. This mesodermal defect is reflected in the <b>median</b> skull <b>defect</b> {{at the site of the}} foramen caecum. The outgrowth of the nasal septum with the concomitant forward displacement of epidermis (surface ectoderm) and attached brain tissue (neural ectoderm) may act as herniating force. The patient study consisted of a clinical investigation, radiological investigations (X skull and CT scans), and surgical treatment in order to obtain specimens which were examined histologically. Clinical findings supportive of the proposed hypothesis are (1) the consistency in the location of the internal skull defect, (2) the close relationship between epidermal structures and glial tissue in 15 out of 29 specimens, and (3) the presence of a normally developed nose in combination with interorbital hypertelorism in all patients.

40|$|Functional {{recovery}} after {{peripheral nerve}} injury depends on both improvement of nerve regeneration and prevention of denervation-related skeletal muscle atrophy. To reach these goals, {{in this study we}} overexpressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by means of local gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV). Local gene transfer in the regenerating peripheral nerve was obtained by reconstructing a 1 -cm-long rat <b>median</b> nerve <b>defect</b> using a vein segment filled with skeletal muscle fibers that have been previously injected with either AAV 2 -VEGF or AAV 2 -LacZ, and the morphofunctional outcome of nerve regeneration was assessed 3 months after surgery. Surprisingly, results showed that overexpression of VEGF in the muscle-vein-combined guide led to a worse nerve regeneration in comparison with AAV-LacZ controls. Local gene transfer in the denervated muscle was obtained by direct injection of either AAV 2 -VEGF or AAV 2 -LacZ in the flexor digitorum sublimis muscle after median nerve transection and results showed a significantly lower progression of muscle atrophy in AAV 2 -VEGF-treated muscles in comparison with muscles treated with AAV 2 -LacZ. Altogether, our results suggest that local delivery of VEGF by AAV 2 -VEGF-injected transplanted muscle fibers do not represent a rational approach to promote axonal regeneration along a venous nerve guide. By contrast, AAV 2 -VEGF direct local injection in denervated skeletal muscle significantly attenuates denervation-related atrophy, thus representing a promising strategy for improving the outcome of post-traumatic neuromuscular recovery after nerve injury and repair.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To define {{by three}} {{dimensional}} echocardiography the pattern and potential determinants of contraction of a secundum atrial septal defect through the cardiac cycle, and {{to evaluate the}} possibility of using cross sectional transthoracic and transoesophageal imaging to assess the dynamic nature of the defect.  DESIGN—Three dimensional echocardiography was performed using a multiplane transoesophageal probe on 50  patients with a secundum atrial septal <b>defect</b> (<b>median</b> age 9. 8  years). Nine patients were excluded because of poor images or morphological features that precluded defect measurement. In 41  cases, defect area, long and short axis length, and distance of the attenuated anterior rim were measured in their largest and smallest dimensions.  RESULTS—Defect area changed significantly through the cardiac cycle (mean change 61 %, p <  0. 0001; range 17 % to 86 %). The defect contracted symmetrically and was not related to patient age, defect size, heart rate, Qp/Qs ratio, the presence of an aneurysmal atrial septum, or attenuated anterior rim. In all cases with an attenuated anterior rim (n =  13), the length of the rim significantly decreased (p =  0. 001) during atrial systole. Dynamic changes measured by either transthoracic or transoesophageal cross sectional images did not correlate with those obtained by three dimensional imaging.  CONCLUSIONS—Three dimensional echocardiography shows dynamic features of defects in the atrial septum.

MethodsWe identified all patients previously given a diagnosis of an inferior sinus venosus defect at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, between 1982 and 2005 by interrogating the cardiology and cardiac surgery databases. We included those having interatrial communications in which 1 {{or more of the}} right pulmonary veins drained to the inferior caval vein but retained connection with the left atrium, the rims of the oval fossa, and the walls of the coronary sinus, both being intact. ResultsWe identified 11 children who had an interatrial communication meeting the criteria for and undergoing surgical repair of an inferior sinus venosus <b>defect.</b> <b>Median</b> age was 1. 2 years; 6 (55 %) subjects were male, and none were cyanotic. Transthoracic echocardiographic analysis was performed preoperatively in all children, revealing right ventricular dilation in all. Surgical repair was accomplished with a pericardial patch. A complex baffle was needed in 3 children to maintain unobstructed inferior caval and pulmonary venous return. The echocardiographic diagnosis was complete in only 5 patients, but all diagnoses were correct since the year 2000. In all children the observations at surgical intervention showed that the defect was a venoatrial communication involving drainage of the right pulmonary veins to the inferior caval vein while retaining connection to the left atrium.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{transformation}} of table olives {{is the result}} of complex biochemical reactions that are determined by the interactions of the indigenous microflora of the olives together with a variety of contaminating microrganisms from different sources (fiber-glass fermenters, PVC tanks, pipelines, pumps and water) with the compositional characteristics of the fruit. One of the most important aspects of improving the quality of table olives is the use of selected microorganisms to drive the fermentation. These can supplant the indigenous microflora and, in particular, the complementary microflora that are responsible for spoilage of canned olives. In this context, from a technological point of view, a well-characterised collection of microrganisms (lactic acid bacteria, yeasts) that is possibly isolated from the matrix to be processed (the olive fruit) will provide the basis for the development of starter culture systems. These cultures can be fully compatible with the typical products and guarantee high quality standards. Inoculation of the brine with such selected starter cultures will reduce the probability of spoilage and help to achieve an improved and more predictable fermentation process. Control of the fermentation processes can thus occur through chemical, chemico-physical and microbiological approaches, and since 2008 (COI/OT/MO/Doc. No 1. Method for the sensory analysis of table olives), also through organoleptic evaluation. This last has established the necessary criteria and procedures for sensory analysis of the negative, gustatory and kinaesthetic sensations of table olives that can also be attributed to abnormal proliferation of microrganisms. It also sets out the systematics for commercial classification, through the assessment of the <b>median</b> of the <b>defect</b> predominantly perceived...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} {{clinical}} prediction model of contribution of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) to {{the pathogenesis of}} lung cancer, by reporting the estimated prevalence and severity by GOLD criteria in a single-institution cohort of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. Primary objective was investigating the effects of impaired lung function with various histological cell types on crude survival, while considering the initial staging of disease extent. Materials & methods: A total of 441 patients, in this historical cohort from electronic medical records, completed spirometry prior to invasive diagnostic procedures and initial treatment of their lung cancer. All statistical analyses, including ANOVA and survival analysis, were performed using SAS version 9. 1 software. Results: Estimated prevalence of COPD was 79. 1 % (95 % confidence interval: 71. 3 %- 82. 9 %). Lung function as measured by spirometry {{was a significant predictor of}} survival time in months (p< 0. 0001) both with and without adjusting for tumor-cell-type, age, and stage of disease. Median survival was similar (p= 0. 32) and longer among those patients with normal pulmonary function, those with restrictive disease patterns, and those with COPD–GOLD- 1 <b>defects.</b> <b>Median</b> survival was shortest among patients with COPD–GOLD- 4 impairment (p= 0. 001). Those patients with COPD–GOLD- 2 and COPD-GOLD- 3 impairment levels had intermediate survival times (p= 0. 003). Conclusions: This investigation suggests that strategies for early detection and slowing the progression of COPD before the development of lung cancer might increase patient survival. As demonstrated in this study, the presence and severity of COPD in lung cancer patients is an independent predictor of survival time, different from the established staging of initial extent of disease...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether there are gender-associated differences in the amount of myocardial salvage after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BackgroundDespite having a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile, women with AMI have similar or even better outcomes after primary PCI compared with men. The reasons for these findings are unclear. MethodsIn this study we included 202 women and 561 men with AMI who underwent primary PCI in the setting of three randomized trials. The primary end point of the study was myocardial salvage index (proportion of initial perfusion defect salvaged by reperfusion therapy), obtained by paired scintigraphic studies performed 7 to 10 days apart. ResultsThe amount of myocardium at risk or initial perfusion <b>defect</b> (<b>median</b> [25 th, 75 th percentiles]) did not differ significantly between women and men (22. 0 % [12. 0, 40. 0] vs. 24. 0 % [14. 0, 39. 0] of the left ventricle [LV], p = 0. 26). Final infarct size, measured in the follow-up scintigraphy, was significantly smaller in women than in men (6. 0 % [0. 71, 18. 7] vs. 10. 0 % [3. 9, 21. 8] of the LV, p = 0. 001). Myocardial salvage index was 0. 64 (0. 35, 0. 95) in women versus 0. 50 (0. 26, 0. 77) in men (p < 0. 001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, female gender was an independent predictor of greater myocardial salvage after PCI (p = 0. 002). ConclusionsThe efficacy of primary PCI in patients with AMI appears to be gender-dependent. Myocardial salvage achieved by primary PCI is greater in women than in men...|$|R
40|$|Well-designed and {{publicly}} available datasets of bugs are an invaluable asset to advance research {{fields such as}} fault localization and program repair. They allow directly and fairly comparison between competing techniques and also the replication of experiments. These datasets need to be deeply understood by researchers: the answer for questions like "which bugs can my technique handle?" and "for which bugs is my technique effective?" depends on the comprehension of properties related to bugs and their patches. However, such properties are usually {{not included in the}} datasets, and there is still no widely adopted methodology for characterizing bugs and patches. In this work, we deeply study 395 patches of the Defects 4 J dataset. Quantitative properties (patch size and spreading) were automatically extracted, whereas qualitative ones (repair actions and patterns) were manually extracted using a thematic analysis-based approach. We found that 1) the <b>median</b> size of <b>Defects</b> 4 J patches is four lines, and almost 30 % of the patches contain only addition of lines; 2) 92 % of the patches change only one file, and 38 % has no spreading at all; 3) the top- 3 most applied repair actions are addition of method calls, conditionals, and assignments, occurring in 77 % of the patches; and 4) nine repair patterns were found for 95 % of the patches, where the most prevalent, appearing in 43 % of the patches, is on conditional blocks. These results are useful for researchers to perform advanced analysis on their techniques' results based on Defects 4 J. Moreover, our set of properties can be used to characterize and compare different bug datasets.

40|$|ObjectivesSince 1996, we have {{routinely}} used a {{minimally invasive}} sex-differentiated surgical approach for surgical repair of various simple congenital heart diseases, mostly including a right anterior minithoracotomy in female subjects and a midline ministernotomy in male subjects. MethodsBetween August 1996 and December 2004, all patients who underwent a sex-differentiated surgical approach were included. Hospital results {{were compared with}} those of a group undergoing full sternotomy (control subjects). Patients' clinical conditions and satisfaction at follow-up were evaluated. ResultsThree hundred eight patients underwent the sex-differentiated surgical approach: (1) minithoracotomy in 147 (47. 7 %) and (2) ministernotomy in 161 (52. 3 %). Thirty patients had a full sternotomy for atrial septal defect closure. The most common diagnosis was an atrial septal defect (231 [75 %] patients). None of the patients required an extension of the surgical access. There were neither major complications nor hospital deaths. All patients were discharged home without residual <b>defects.</b> <b>Median</b> follow-up time was 71. 5 months (range, 48. 2 – 85. 7 months). There were no late deaths. No scoliosis, asymmetric breast development, or lactation problems were reported in the minithoracotomy group. Twenty-five (17 %) of 147 patients with minithoracotomies complained of a trivial, persistent (< 6 months), sensitive skin deficit in the mammary area, most often localized at the inferomedial quadrant. The vast majority of patients (296 [96 %] 308 patients) were in New York Heart Association class I, and 282 (91. 5 %) of 308 patients were satisfied with the cosmetic result of the operation. ConclusionsThe sex-differentiated surgical approach for simple congenital heart disease is a safe procedure, providing both excellent functional and cosmetic results. Anterolateral minithoracotomy is a valid and highly appreciated procedure in female patients...|$|R

40|$|Object To {{assess the}} impact that injury {{severity}} has on complications in patients {{who have had a}} decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods This prospective observational cohort study included all patients who underwent a decompressive craniectomy following severe TBI at the two major trauma hospitals in Western Australia from 2004 to 2012. All complications were recorded during this period. The clinical and radiological data of the patients on initial presentation were entered into a web-based model prognostic model, the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head injury) collaborators prediction model, to obtain the predicted risk of an unfavourable outcome which was used as a measure of injury severity. Results Complications after decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI were common. The predicted risk of unfavourable outcome was strongly associated with the development of neurological complications such as herniation of the brain outside the skull bone <b>defects</b> (<b>median</b> predicted risk of unfavourable outcome for herniation 72 % vs. 57 % without herniation, p = 0. 001), subdural effusion (median predicted risk of unfavourable outcome 67 % with an effusion vs. 57 % for those without an effusion, p = 0. 03), hydrocephalus requiring ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (median predicted risk of unfavourable outcome 86 % for those with hydrocephalus vs. 59 % for those without hydrocephalus, p = 0. 001), but not infection (p = 0. 251) or resorption of bone flap (p = 0. 697) and seizures (0. 987). We did not observe any associations between timing of cranioplasty and risk of infection or resorption of bone flap after cranioplasty. Conclusions Mechanical complications after decompressive craniectomy including herniation of the brain outside the skull bone defects, subdural effusion, and hydrocephalus requiring ventriculo-peritoneal shunt were more common in patients with a more severe form of TBI when quantified by the CRASH predicted risk of unfavourable outcome. The CRASH predicted risk of unfavourable outcome represents a useful baseline characteristic of patients in observational and interventional trials involving patients with severe TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Postoperative {{pulmonary}} hypertension in children after congenital heart surgery {{is a risk}} factor for death and is associated with severe acute changes in both pulmonary vascular resistance and lung mechanics.  OBJECTIVE—To examine the impact of changes in pulmonary blood flow on lung mechanics in preoperative children with congenital heart disease, in order to assess the cause-effect relation of pulmonary vascular-bronchial interactions.  DESIGN—Prospective, cross sectional study.  SETTING—Cardiac catheterisation laboratory, general anaesthesia with mechanical ventilation.  INTERVENTIONS—Variation of pulmonary blood flow (Qp) by either balloon occlusion of an atrial septal defect before interventional closure, or by complete occlusion of the pulmonary artery during balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for pulmonary valve stenosis.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Ventilatory tidal volume (Vt), dynamic respiratory system compliance (Cdyn), respiratory system resistance (Rrs).  RESULTS— 28 occlusions were examined in nine patients with atrial septal <b>defect</b> (<b>median</b> age 9. 5  years) and 22  in eight patients with pulmonary stenosis (median age 1. 2  years). Normalisation of Qp during balloon occlusion of atrial septal defect caused no significant change in airway pressures and Rrs, but there was a small decrease in Vt (mean (SD) : 9. 61  (0. 85) to 9. 52  (0. 97)  ml/kg; p <  0. 05) and Cdyn (0. 64  (0. 11) to 0. 59  (0. 10)  ml/cm H 2 O*kg; p <  0. 01). These changes were more pronounced when there was complete cessation of Qp during balloon valvuloplasty in pulmonary stenosis, with a fall in Vt (9. 71  (2. 95) to 9. 32  (2. 84)  ml/kg; p <  0. 05) and Cdyn (0. 72  (0. 29) to 0. 64  (0. 26)  ml/cm H 2 O*kg; p <  0. 001), and there was also an increase in Rrs (25. 1  (1. 7) to 28. 8  (1. 6)  cm H 2 O/litre*s; p <  0. 01). All these changes exceeded the variability of the baseline measurements more than threefold.  CONCLUSIONS—Acute changes in pulmonary blood flow are associated with simultaneous changes in lung mechanics. While these changes are small they may represent a valid model to explain the pathophysiological impact of spontaneous changes in pulmonary blood flow in clinically more critical situations in children with congenital heart disease.    Keywords: pulmonary blood flow; lung mechanics; catheter intervention; cardiopulmonary interactio...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} given to chitosan (CS) -based biomaterials and their applications in the field of soft tissue engineering (TE). CS is a glycosaminoglycan derived from chitin, the primary structural polymer in crustacean exoskeletons. CS is biocompatible, biodegradable, easily formed into various structures (i. e. sponges, nanofibers and films) under mild processing conditions and can be chemically modified through graft copolymerization and crosslinking. However, the rapid degradation of CS and its low mechanical strength are concerns that may limit its use in clinical applications. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, different non cytotoxic crosslinkers were used aiming at improving the structural properties of CS. Genipin (GP), γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), dibasic sodium phosphate (DSP) were selected as biocompatible CS crosslinkers as reported in literature. After a preliminary physico-chemical and mechanical characterization, the proper crosslinking compounds were selected for the development of different typologies of CS scaffolds for both human and veterinary applications. CS- based scaffolds were developed as nerve guidance channels (NGCs) and internal fillers fabrication to promote peripheral nerve regeneration in humans. Two CS based hollow NGCs were prepared and tested in vitro and in vivo (coded as CS flat membrane and bi-layer CS membrane) and a CS based nanostructured internal filler was optimized and characterized in vitro. i. CS flat membranes were prepared by solvent casting. According to the results obtained in the first part of the thesis, DSP alone (CS/DSP) or in association with the GPTMS (CS/GPTMS_DSP) were used as crosslinkers. CS crosslinked membranes showed permeation to nutrients and did not exert any cytotoxic effect on RT 4 -D 6 P 2 T. The higher mechanical stability of CS/GPTMS_DSP under wet state allowed to confirm the RT 4 -D 6 P 2 T attachment and proliferation as well as the neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on CS substrates. Before in vivo implantation in rats, CS/GPTMS_DSP and CS/DSP membranes were easily rolled up to form a NGC. Then, membranes were used to bridge <b>median</b> nerve <b>defects</b> in rats. After 12 week post-operative CS/GPTMS_DSP tubes were found to be detached from the distal suturing site and functional recovery did not occurred. On the other hand, crushed nerve encircled with CS/DSP membranes, allowed nerve fibre regeneration and functional recovery, showing similar results to autografts. ii. Bi-layer CS membranes were developed using a two-step coating technique. CS/DSP and CS/GPTMS_DSP flat membranes were combined to produce scaffold structures with good biocompatibility in the inner layer (CS/DSP) and with the desired mechanical strength imparted by the outer (CS/GPTMS_DSP, GPTMS 25 % wt. /wt.). Gradual water uptake and permeation to small molecules was observed compared to single layers. From in vivo tests, median nerves treated with bi-layer tubes displayed regenerated and aligned fibres at the injury site. iii. CS crosslinked electrospun nanofibres were fabricated by electrospinning solutions containing CS, polyethylene oxide (PEO), and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). PEO and DMSO were introduced to allow the spinnability of CS solutions at high polymer concentration with controllable fiber size and increase fiber yields by relaxing CS chain entanglement. Optimization of the process and solution parameters allowed to obtain CS nanofibres with size of 128 ± 17 nm. To increase CS stability in aqueous media, DSP was used as crosslinker After DSP crosslinking fibre size decreased to 109 ± 17 nm while an increase in the mechanical strength (E, from 63 ± 10 MPa to 113 ± 8 MPa) was observed compared to uncrosslinked nanofibrous matrices. In the third part of the thesis, CS porous membranes with improved antimicrobial properties were prepared for veterinary application. The developed scaffolds were fabricated by freeze-drying to promote the wound healing process and to reduce the bacterial proliferation in chelonian shell injury site. Different ratios of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % wt. /wt.) and gentamicin sulphate (GS, 3. 5 mg/ml) were loaded into the CS/GPTMS_DSP membranes to impart the proper antibacterial properties and to favor drug release avoiding the risk of systemic toxicity. After a preliminary in vitro characterization, CS/GPTMS_DSP loaded with AgNPs at a concentration of 10 % wt. /wt (CS/GPTMS_DSP_AgNP 10) was selected as ideal candidate for this application field. GS release profile from CS/GPTMS_DSP_GS evidenced high burst release of the antibiotics in the first day (about 70 %). Finally, GS and AgNPs (10 % wt. /wt.) effect on bacterial inhibition was evaluated and confirmed against Gram+ and Gram-. The results reported in this thesis work demonstrate that CS is a promising candidate for applications in human and veterinary soft TE. Mechanical and physico-chemical properties of CS scaffolds can be tuned by using different crosslinking methods. By the in vitro characterization, GPTMS and DSP were selected as ideal compounds to the development of scaffolds for peripheral nerve regeneration (in human) and wound healing (in animals). Four different morphologies (3 for peripheral nerve regeneration and 1 for wound healing application) were obtained by varying the fabrication methods and the final composition. All membranes were found to satisfy the requirements for the application of interest. CS based membranes developed for peripheral nerve regeneration were found to be biocompatible, and successful functional recovery was observed in case of CS/DSP and bi-layer membranes. Porous membranes with improved antimicrobial properties were prepared to enhance wound healing in chelonians and were found to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria following the release of two different investigated antimicrobial agents (AgNPs and GS...|$|R
