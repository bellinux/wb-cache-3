Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill.

The researcher aimed at determining {{the influence of}} Logistics Information management on lead time, assessment {{on the effects of}} inventory management policies on reducing stock outs, influence of transport system should be used on product delivery and inventory costs that are incurred and affects profitability of the company. The research was carried out at Browncast <b>steel</b> <b>merchant</b> company a member of <b>steel</b> <b>merchant</b> in Zimbabwe <b>Steel</b> Industry. Major arguments highlighted issues on the influence of inventory costs shows that some cost of capital tied up should be used for other purposes, information, materials and inventory should flow from the steel supplier in a less cost and faster way. The research relied on descriptive research design aided by exploratory design. A sample size of 82 respondents was used, 24 employees and 58 steel suppliers. An average questionnaire response rate of 87 % was achieved. Interviews were also administered to top management. Both probability and non-probability sampling to achieve unbiased results. Both primary and secondary data was from inbound logistics textbooks, interviews, questionnaires, company financial reports enabling validity of the research. Major findings concludes that storage space costs influence inventory costs on company profitability and unutilized space maybe rented out. The use of 3 to 4 tonnes sizes of delivery trucks proved small as they determine the influence of transport therefore 5 tonne trucks may be used, information technologies facilities like internet should be adopted for quick movement of information and maximize inventory postponement policy...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Steel</b> <b>Merchant</b> {{offers a}} service of {{stocking}} and distributing steel products and {{value added services}} throughout Africa. The company is the largest <b>steel</b> <b>merchant</b> in Africa employing over 5500 employees. The South African government implemented the Employment Equity Act, No 55, (1998) and Broad-Based Black Economic Act, No 53, (2003) to readdress the discrimination {{of the past and}} create fair opportunities for Previously Disadvantaged Individuals (PDI) in the workplace. The <b>Steel</b> <b>Merchant's</b> business environment is severely affected by these legislations and is required to comply with the provisions of the Act or will receive fines and penalties. Since the Acts inception the merchant continues to struggle in recruiting and retaining PDIs in professionally qualified and management positions. The organization has experienced strategic drift by falling from a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Procurement Recognition/Status Level of 5 down to level 6. The research identified various factors within the organization that are hindering its overall ability to adapt and progress in terms of Employment Equity (EE) and BEE. The study is focused on identifying the internal and external barriers that prevent the effective implementation of BEE and EE strategies in order to recruit and retain previously disadvantaged professionals at the <b>Steel</b> <b>Merchant.</b> The Research Objectives are: • To evaluate the effect of organizational culture and climate on the implementation of Employment Equity, Affirmative Action (AA) and BEE Strategies • To analyze the importance of Human Resource Management (HRM) in the development of recruitment and retention strategies of previously disadvantaged professionals • To investigate the differences in gender and race leadership qualities and behavior • To identify and assess the barriers in implementing employment equity recruitment and retention strategies • To determine how government legislation will influence the Steel Organizations' competitiveness internationally Internal secondary data was used to analyze the Merchant's Human Resource Management, EE and BEE performance. External secondary data from the South African government departments was used to analyze the legislative Acts and how the company performs compared to the industry standards. A quantitative research approach was followed in the investigation. A questionnaire was developed using closed-ended questions to obtain information related to the respondent's demographical background as well as their opinion on each objective. The questionnaire was distributed by email to 1 00 employees and weighted according to racial group (Black, White, Coloured and Asian) and gender (Male and Female). The method allowed the researcher to receive and analyze the information quickly at no financial cost. Descriptive statistics were used to interpret the results and describe the behaviour of each racial and gender group contained in the sample. The data methods used were: • Percentages • The mean, mode and median • Standard Deviation The conclusions from the sample were used to generalize about the <b>steel</b> <b>merchant</b> population whilst research from recognized academics was utilized to authenticate and substantiate the research findings improving the accuracy and reliability of the research. The results of the study identified the following factors have contributed to the merchant's inability to recruit and retain PDI at professionally qualified and management levels: • The <b>Steel</b> <b>Merchant</b> has a white male dominated organizational culture and ineffective HRM strategies • Black shareholders have contributed little towards previously disadvantaged development creating resentment by employees • Employment Equity, Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative action has created racial divides, a lack of trust and will negatively influence the company's competitiveness internationally. The research identified various problems that hinder the implementation of EE and BEE policy at the <b>steel</b> <b>merchant</b> which makes it difficult to recruit and retain talented PDI. The following recommendations have been made to minimize resistance and integrate EE and BEE policies to improve recruitment and retention in the organization: • Define and communicate the BEE/EE vision and strategy • Delayer hierarchal levels • National Culture Training • Implement Performance Management Systems • lncentivize Knowledge Sharing • Re-evaluate the recruitment policies • Train, develop and mentor PDI • Develop career paths and succession plans • Create a leadership development program • Create a shared understanding of EE • Address white fears through empowerment • Black shareholders should be actively involved with the development of PO employees • Harness African culture to succeed internationally. EE and BEE is obligatory and will inevitably influence the company's performance. The <b>Steel</b> <b>Merchant</b> has the resources and capabilities to eliminate resistance and implement effective HRM strategies to recruit and retain talented POl in professional and management positions. By achieving this objective, the company's Broad Based Black Employment Equity (BBBEE) rating will advance resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage and more business opportunities in the future.
