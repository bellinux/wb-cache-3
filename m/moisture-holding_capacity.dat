40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a conceptual hydrological flux model for the long term continuous simulation of runoff and drought risk for green roof systems. A green roof's retention capacity depends upon its physical configuration, but it is also strongly influenced by local climatic controls, including the rainfall characteristics and the restoration of retention capacity associated with evapotranspiration during dry weather periods. The model includes a function that links evapotranspiration rates to substrate moisture content, and is validated against observed runoff data. The model's application to typical extensive green roof configurations is demonstrated with reference to four UK locations characterised by contrasting climatic regimes, using 30 -year rainfall time-series inputs at hourly simulation time steps. It is shown that retention performance is dependent upon local climatic conditions. Volumetric retention ranges from 0. 19 (cool, wet climate) to 0. 59 (warm, dry climate). Per event retention is also considered, and it is demonstrated that retention performance decreases significantly when high return period events are considered in isolation. For example, in Sheffield the median per-event retention is 1. 00 (many small events), but the median retention for events exceeding a 1 in 1 yr return period threshold is only 0. 10. The simulation tool also provides useful information about the likelihood of drought periods, for which irrigation may be required. A sensitivity study suggests that green roofs with reduced <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and/or low evapotranspiration rates will tend to offer reduced levels of retention, whilst high <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and low evapotranspiration rates offer the strongest drought resistance...|$|E

In compact humid-tropical Hong Kong, two green-roof and a control bare-roof plots were installed on a high-rise building. Precision temperature sensors were installed in a holistic vertical profile extending from outdoor air to roof surface, green-roof material layers, and indoor ceiling and air. The apartments under the plots were kept unoccupied to monitor air-conditioning energy consumption. The comprehensive-systematic data allowed in-depth analysis of thermal performance of vegetation (Sedum and Perennial Peanut) and weather (sunny, cloudy and rainy) in summer. Intense solar radiation at Control plot triggered significant material heating, which in turn warmed near-ground air to intensify UHI effect and indoor space to lift energy consumption. Sedum plot with incomplete plant cover, low transpiration rate and limited substrate moisture experienced feeble evapotranspiration cooling.

During this period, a corresponding increase and decrease occurred in the percentages of cells in the 0. 3 - to 0. 5 -μm diameter range, but dividing cells were rarely observed.

This paper addresses the determination of coal porosity (namely micro- and macroporosity) in relation to the molecular size of different gases. Experiments entailed a sorption process, which includes the direct method of determining the ‘‘void volume’’ of samples using different gases (helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane). Because gas behaviour depends on pressure and temperature conditions, it is critical, in each case, to know the gas characteristics, especially the compressibility factor. The experimental conditions of the sorption process were as follows: temperature in the bath 35 ºC; sample with moisture equal to or greater than the <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> (MHC), particle size of sample less than 212 mm, and mass ca. 100 g. The present investigation was designed to confirm that when performing measurements of the coal void volume with helium and nitrogen, there are only small and insignificant changes in the volume determinations. Inducing great shrinkage and swelling effects in the coal molecular structure, carbon dioxide leads to ‘‘abnormal’’ negative values in coal void volume calculations, since the rate of sorbed and free gas is very high. In fact, when in contact with the coal structure, carbon dioxide is so strongly retained that the sorbed gas volume is much higher than the free gas volume. However, shrinkage and swelling effects in coal structure induced by carbon dioxide are fully reversible. Methane also induces shrinkage and swelling when in contact with coal molecular structure, but these effects, although smaller than those induced by carbon dioxide, are irreversible and increase the coal volume...|$|E

The moisture gain to a depth of 4 ft between the harvest of one crop and the planting of the succeeding crop ranged from — 0 - 3 to 5. 0 in., with an average of 2. 2 in. representing 17 per cent. of the rainfall. Available moisture at planting averaged 42 ̆ 78 in., the excess of 2. 6 in. over fallow gain being due to the available moisture already in the soil at the preceding harvest. In this locality, therefore, moisture accumulation commonly occurs prior to harvest, owing to rainfall in excess of crop requirements at this period. The average values for available moisture at planting were well below the capacity of these soils for storage to 4 ft. Values following long fallow averaged 6. 5 in., and were as high as 9. 1) in. in one instance. Correlations have been sought between fallow moisture gain and available moisture at planting, and the associated soil and climatic factors. The more important findings were:Total rainfall during the fallowing period was not correlated with fallow moisture gain. Fallow moisture gain and available moisture at planting were correlated with March-April rain. Fallow moisture gain was correlated negatively with available moisture at the preceding harvest and positively with available moisture at planting. The clay content of the soil and depth of surface mulch were not significantly related to fallow moisture gain nor to available moisture at planting. No significant difference in moisture accumulation was observed between sites stubble-mulched and those stubble-bumt. Explanations in terms of climatic and soil characteristics are offered for the results obtained. Features considered important are the characteristics of the rainfall and the high-evaporation conditions, the low rate of moisture penetration in wet soil, and the high <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of the surface soil layers...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity in managed {{plantations}} {{has become}} an important issue for long-term sustainability of ecosystems. The environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges (low = 1, 000 - 1, 400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1, 400 - 1, 800 masl, and high = 1, 800 - 2, 200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations {{for a total of}} 27 plots. We calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges, employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer, but soil <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types...|$|E
40|$|Due to an {{increase}} in impermeable hard surfaces, urbanization has led to the deterioration of urban watercourses and increased the quantity of stormwater runoff. It may be argued that the current norm of impermeable roofs represents a wasted opportunity. Green roofs have the potential to replace some of the hydrological characteristics of natural catchments that are normally lost as a consequence of urbanization and the removal of vegetation. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} develop a generic green roof rainfall runoff response model capable of predicting the temporal variations within any configuration of green roof in response to an arbitrary rainfall input. It was recognized that the preliminary investigations has led to the identification of a subset of processes/parameters for a green roof which warranted more detailed investigation. In this case the substrate moisture holding capacity and the losses due to evapotranspiration were identified as key controlling variables to be identified. To simulate the function of stormwater drainage, a direct observation of the system's behaviour is required. Hence, an established `typical' small scale green roof (1. 0 in x 3. 0 m) on the roof of Sheffield University has been monitored with the intention to relate both retention and detention with fundamental, measurable, physical properties of the system. A continuous long time-series of data, in the period of 29 months, from the test rig was analysed and interpreted. Laboratory analyses on physical properties and evaporation of the substrates were undertaken and relationships between measureable physical properties and model parameter values were identified. The empirical (requiring site-specific calibration using monitored data) conceptual model now has been developed into a physically-based model. Although the model still needs to be refined, independent physically-based methods have been identified for defining two key parameters (evapotranspiration (ET) and the maximum <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> (WC,,, a,,)). ET can be estimated using a modified form of Thornthwaite's equation, and WC [...] , may be determined by physical laboratory assessment of the substrate. The proposed hydrological model has been shown to reproduce monitored data, both during a storm event, and over a longer continuous simulation period. ...|$|E
30|$|Vermicomposting is {{the process}} of {{producing}} compost by utilizing earthworms to turn the organic waste into high-quality compost that consists mainly of worm cast in addition to decayed organic matter (Ismail 2005; Devi and Prakash 2015). Vermicomposting helps to convert the organic wastes (agro-wastes, animal manure and domestic refuse) into highly nutrient fertilizers for plant and soil (Gajalakshmi and Abassi 2004). Vermicompost is a finely divided peat-like material with excellent structure, porosity, aeration, drainage and <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity</b> (Ismail 2005; Edwards et al. 2011). Vermicompost, an organic fertilizer rich in NPK, micronutrients and beneficial soil microbes (nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing bacteria and actinomycetes), is a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is an excellent growth promoter and protector for crop plants (Sinha et al. 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2015). Today vermicompost is an important component of organic farming systems, because it is easy to prepare, has excellent properties and is harmless to plants. Vermicompost improves the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil as well contributes to organic enrichment (Ansari and Jaikishun 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2013). In 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (LVV) in Suriname made an attempt to investigate vermicomposting, but did not achieve significant results (Nanden and Dipotaroeno 1996). Since then, no research has been conducted in this area in Suriname. Investigations on vermicomposting and its impact on vegetable production are necessary, especially as it {{can be used as a}} bio-fertilizer. Research on vermicomposting will provide farmers with an environment-friendly fertilizer and assist in promoting the agriculture sector towards a greener future. The use of such technology will help in cost management in agriculture which is increased in the recent years and has added to the burden of farmers in terms of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides. Consequently, the cost of production has increased many folds. Use of organic source of fertilizers like vermicompost could be an effective solution to the problem where it could substitute the chemical inputs in crop productivity and reduce the economic cost and on the other hand may also lead to organic produce which fetches higher price in the market. The increase in living standards around the world has created a growing demand for such organic produce, or cultivation using only natural pesticides and fertilizers, which are perceived to be healthier for consumers and environment friendly (Kaplan 2016).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In recent years, {{the effect}} of {{exogenous}} organic amendments on soil properties and plant growth characteristics has received renewed attention. Although the utilization of mineral fertilizers {{could be viewed as}} the best solution in terms of plant productivity, this approach is often inefficient in the long-term in tropical ecosystems due to the limited ability of low-activity clay soils to retain nutrients. Intensive use of agrochemicals in agricultural systems is also known to have irreversible effects on soil and water resources. Compost is organic matter that has been decomposed and recycled as a fertilizer and soil amendment. Compost can greatly enhance the physical structure of soil. Decomposing organic amendments slowly release nutrients which may be taken up by plants and thus result in improved agroecosystem productivity. Vermicompost is currently being promoted to improve soil quality, reduces water and fertilizer needs and therefore increases the sustainability of agricultural practices in tropical countries. Vermicomposting is a process which stabilizes organic matter under aerobic and mesophilic conditions through the joint action of earthworms and microorganisms. The products of vermicomposting have been successfully used to suppress plant pests and disease as well as increase crop productivity. Cow manure is an excellent fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients. It also adds organic matter to the soil which may improve soil structure, aeration, soil <b>moisture-holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> and water infiltration. Plant density is the number of individuals of a given plants that occurs within a given sample unit or study area. Planting density can impact the overall health of plants. Plantings that are too sparse (the density is too low) may be more susceptible to weeds, while planting that are too dense might force plants to compete over scarce nutrients and water and cause stunted growth. Despite of many studies on {{the effect of}} organic fertilizers and plant density on different crops, information on the effects of these factors for many medicinal plants is scarce. Therefore, in this study the effect of organic fertilizers and plant density on morphological characteristics and yield of Echium amoenum was studied in a low input cropping system. Materials and methods: In order to evaluate the plant density and comparison of organic and chemical fertilizers on Iranian Ox-Tongue (Echium amoenum), a split plots experiment in time based on RCBD design with three replications was conducted in 2011 - 2014 growing seasons, in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The main plots included factorial combination of 3 plant densities (3, 5 and 10 plants per m 2) and 4 different types of organic and chemical fertilizers (compost, vermicompost, cow manure, nitrogen chemical fertilizer and control) and the sub plots included agronomic years (2 and 3 agronomic years). Results and discussion:The results showed that the effect of plant density on dry flower yield was significant, so that the highest dry flower yield (816 kg. ha- 1) obtained for 5 plants per m 2 and in this treatment dry flower yield was 23...|$|E
