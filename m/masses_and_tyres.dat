40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} mechanistic-empirical {{pavement}} damage model to predict changes in 3 D road profiles due to dynamic axle loads. The traffic {{is represented by}} a fleet of quarter cars which allows for statistical variability in model parameters such as velocity, suspension stiffness, suspension damping, sprung <b>mass,</b> unsprung <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> stiffness. The fleet model generates statistical distributions of dynamic force at each point which are used to predict pavement damage. As the pavement deteriorates, the distributions of dynamic axle force are changed by the changing road profile. This paper introduces a 3 D approach – the transverse position of the wheel is represented by a Laplace probability distribution. This influences {{the extent to which}} the force patterns are spatially repeatable. Differences in the range of 10 – 30 % are found between 2 D and 3 D predictions of pavement life...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanistic}} {{empirical method}} of flexible pavement design/assessment uses {{a large number}} of numerical truck model runs to predict a history of dynamic load. The pattern of dynamic load distribution along the pavement is a key factor in the design/ assessment of flexible pavement. While this can be measured in particular cases, there are no reliable methods of predicting the mean pattern for typical traffic conditions. A simple linear quarter car model is developed here which aims to reproduce the mean and variance of dynamic loading of the truck fleet at a given site. This probabilistic model reflects the range and frequency of the different heavy trucks on the road and their dynamic properties. Multiple Sensor Weigh-in-Motion data can be used to calibrate the model. Truck properties such as suspension stiffness, suspension damping, sprung <b>mass,</b> unsprung <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> stiffness are represented as randomly varying parameters in the fleet model. It is used to predict the statistical distribution of dynamic load at each measurement point. The concept is demonstrated by using a pre-defined truck fleet to calculate a pattern of statistical spatial repeatability and is tested by using that pattern to find the truck statistical properties that generated it...|$|R

The {{issues related to the}} design of vehicle models with skyhook control are discussed. Three basic models with linear parameters are explained: quarter-, half- and full-car. The road profile is generated from a spatial power spectral density (PSD) to represent a typical road (based on ISO 8608 classification). The normalized root-mean-square values of sprung <b>mass</b> acceleration <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> load forces are used to assess the vehicle ride comfort and handling performance based on five benchmark road profiles employed in industrial tests...|$|R
40|$|Tyre-road rolling {{resistance}} {{is a major}} factor in the performance of a vehicle. By investigating the {{rolling resistance}}, a better understanding of the efficiency of different wheel diameters will develop. A major issue in the mountain biking world is the relative merits of using 26 in. versus 29 in. wheels and the resultant effect on cyclist performance. As rolling resistance is indicative of the behaviour of a vehicle over specific terrain, it can be viewed as an objective parameter to compare the relative performance of these two wheel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rolling resistance of four mountain bikes as affected by wheel diameter and terrain type, cyclist <b>mass,</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure <b>and</b> suspension type using coast-down tests. The following major conclusions were drawn: average rolling resistance of the 26 in. diameter wheel was higher than that of the 29 in. diameter wheel; a sand surfacing had the highest rolling resistance coefficient; terrain surface showed the largest effect on rolling resistance coefficients measured, followed by the cyclist <b>mass,</b> wheel diameter <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure; <b>and</b> the best combination for maintaining momentum after traversing over an obstacle was high tyre inflation pressure, low cyclist <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> full suspension 29 in. wheel diameter option.

40|$|The {{foundation}} {{of this research}} work was laid by {{the vision of a}} tractor simulator where the users can generate their customized tractor model with the help of just a user-interface. The aim of this paper was to modify the attributes of the tractor simulation model. For the same reason, a modeling configurator was developed for the tractor model in python programming language with a user-friendly interface designed over Microsoft excel. This research work reports the effort in the development of modeling configurator for parameterizing a tractor model. The modeling configurator has been designed {{in such a way that}} the users can select their choices just from a drop down menu in the user-interface. The attributes that can be parameterized are maximum torque of the engine, maximum braking torque for the engine, number of forward and reverse gears. For tyre modeling, special attention was paid as the modeling configurator allowed users to select only from the standard tyres available, whose width and diameter are predefined. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> number of <b>tyres</b> can also be modified. At last, additional equipment that can be used in farming was also modeled as an assembly file. For additional equipment, only trailer has been covered within the scope of this research work whose mass is predefined. The modeling configurator was validated by selecting different options in the user-interface and then running the simulation file and noting down the differences. Some differences can be visualized like the number of <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> attached trailer, while other differences can be seen with the help of plots like maximum torque of the engine, gear index, <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> profiles. For the masses of the tyres, user can only feel the difference while running the simulator in real-time. At the end of the research, scope for future work is also suggested based on the limitations of this research work...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates passive vehicle {{suspensions}} with inerters {{by considering}} multiple performance requirements including ride comfort, suspension deflection <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip, where suspension deflection performance is novelly considered which is formulated {{as a part}} of objective functions and a constraint separately. Six suspension configurations are analyzed and the analytical solutions for each performance measure are derived. The conditions for each configuration to be strictly better than the simpler ones are obtained by presenting the analytical solutions of each configuration based on those of the simpler ones. Then, two stages of comparisons are given to show the performance limitations of suspension deflection for passive suspensions with inerters. In the first stage, it is shown that although the configurations with inerters can improve the mixed performance of ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip, the suspension deflection performance is significantly decreased simultaneously. In the second stage, it is shown that for passive suspensions with inerters, suspension deflection is the more basic limitation for both ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip performance by doing comparisons among mixed ride comfort and suspension deflection optimization, mixed ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip optimization, <b>and</b> mixed suspension deflection <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip optimization. Finally, the problem of mixed ride comfort <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> grip performance optimization with equal suspension deflection is investigated. The limitations of suspension deflection for each configuration are further highlighted. <br/...|$|R
