In this study, we successfully prepared hBN nanosheets with a thickness of a few atoms by using amine-capped aniline trimer (AT) as dispersant. Epoxy/hBN nanocomposites were prepared by curing reaction of epoxy E 51, Jeffamine D 230 and AT-modified hBN nanosheets, where the hBN contents were 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 wt%. An increase in contact angle of the epoxy/hBN nanocomposites was evident in the presence of hBN nanosheets, implying an increase in the hydrophobic nature of the composites.

The engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. A detailed theoretical analysis was completed to determine engine specifications and operating conditions. Results from the analysis indicated a new engine design was necessary to sustain highly TC operation. Dry sump lubrication was implemented after initial oil surge problems were found with the wet sump system during vehicle testing. The design {{and development of the}} system is outlined, together with brake performance effects for the varying systems. Tuning an odd fire engine with an intake restriction and upstream throttle location was explored together with varying injector locations and manifold geometry. To improve engine efficiency, turbocharging and specific engine downsizing were employed in conjunction with a lean burn strategy at low brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). This engine package and tuning strategy resulted in the Melbourne University Formula SAE vehicle being very successful in competition, finishing first in the fuel economy event at the 2004 Australasian competition.

The works, which were designed and constructed by John Urpeth Rastrick, were connected to the Stourbridge canal by a tramway. Although the designer Rastrick had many years experience of steam engine construction and railway engineering, the only locomotive he had built before was the Catch Me Who Can, designed by Richard Trevithick. An article in The Engineer from 1890 points out the similarities between the design adopted for Agenoria and that of the celebrated Puffing Billy of 1813-14. The locomotive, tender and water weighed around 11 tons according to an exhibition catalogue of 1884. It had four coupled wheels of 4 ft ¾in diameter and two cylinders of 8.5 inches diameter by 36 inches stroke. The cylinders acted through grasshopper beams, generally an unusual feature, but used on all of Foster, Rastrick's locomotives.

40|$|The central {{hypothesis}} of functional tissue engineering {{is that an}} engineered construct {{can serve as a}} viable replacement tissue in vivo by replicating the structure and function of native tissue. In the case of articular cartilage, this requires the reproduction of the bulk <b>mechanical</b> and surface <b>lubrication</b> properties of native hyaline cartilage. Cartilage tissue engineering has primarily focused on achieving the bulk mechanical prop-erties of native cartilage such as the compressive aggregate modulus and tensile strength. A scaffold-free self-assembling process has been developed that produces engineered cartilage with compressive properties ap-proaching native tissue levels. Thus, the next step in this process is to begin addressing the friction coefficient and wear properties of these engineered constructs. The superficial zone protein (SZP), also known as lubricin or PRG 4, is a boundary mode lubricant that is synthesized by surface zone (SZ) articular chondrocytes. Under conditions of high loading and low sliding speeds, SZP reduces friction and wear at the articular surface. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether increasing the proportion of SZ chondrocytes in cartilage constructs, in the absence of external stimuli such as growth factors and mechanical loading, would enhance the secretion of SZP and improve their frictional properties. In this study, cartilage constructs were engineered through a self-assembling process with varying ratios of SZ and middle zone (MZ) chondrocytes (SZ:MZ) : 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 100 : 0.

Reliability impacts the company image and its financial health, however most manufacturing startups {{do not have a}} solid understanding of their product's reliability. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce systematic failure analysis to the engineering design process and to establish a framework for testing and analyzing product life so that imperative business decisions and design improvements could be made with regards to reliability. A detailed study and implementation of these process improvements to address reliability issues was conducted at New Valence Robotics Corporation (NVBOTS) in Boston, Massachusetts. Systematic failure analysis was achieved through the creation and implementation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) procedures. A single FMEA iteration was performed on the NVPro printer to identify the top risk component-linear ball bushings-for detailed life analysis. Following an in-depth investigation of potential failure modes of the linear bushings, an Accelerated Life Test (ALT) was designed using Design of Experiments (DOE) principles. An accompanying test apparatus with mechatronic control was also designed. The ALT was not actually executed but representative data was analyzed for illustrative purposes using the General Log-Linear (GLL) life-stress relationship and a 2 -parameter Weibull distribution for the accelerating stresses of <b>mechanical</b> load and <b>lubrication.</b> The work performed provides NVBOTS and similar high-technology manufacturing startups a complete starting point for systematically analyzing their product's reliability and quantitatively evaluating its life in a resource efficient way. by Ali Shabbir.

40|$|All dynamic <b>mechanical</b> {{equipment}} needs <b>lubrication</b> {{to perform}} in a best possible way. In the maritime industry, e. g. ships, {{many of the most}} important dynamic mechanical systems are located {{beneath the surface of the}} sea. Examples of equipment are thrusters, stern tubes and ship stabilizers. All these components are dependent on proper lubrication to perform optimally and secure a long service-life. In the interface between the seawater moving parts, a seal is required to separate the oil and seawater from each other. Due to new requirements, conventional mineral oil shall be exchanged with an environmentally acceptable lubricant (EAL). In this study dierent elastomers were tested against dierent steels (S 355 -steel and NiCrsteel) with two dierent oils (Shell Omala 68 and Kl uberbio EG 2 - 68). The motivation for performing the tests was to identify the tribological properties of the elastomers in the required EAL compared to the oil in use, and occurring mechanisms and the chemomechanical eects of the lubricants in interaction with the seal. The testing was performed at lab scale using a "Pin-on-plate" conguration in a tribomachine. To investigate the eect of the lubricants on the elastomers two soaking tests were performed, and soaked samples were tribologically evaluated. The result from this study showed that the conventional mineral oil give the lowest coecient of friction (COF) when comparing the two oils. When comparing the elastomers, NBR showed a lower COF than FKM. It was concluded that all the elastomers are operating in a boundary/mixed lubrication regime. NBR exhibit higher wear compared to FKM in most situations, exceptions are when adding abrasive particles (Silicon Carbides) to the lubricant and the contact pressure (CP) is low. Transfer of polymer from adhesive wear towards the metal surface could be observed for all elastomers. The results from the soaking tests showed that EAL degrade NBR more than conventional oil and that higher temperatures accelerate the degradation. In the soaking test FKM gained mass from aging.

5000|$|The fourth locomotive, Agenoria, {{was built}} for service on the Earl of Dudley's Shutt End Colliery Railway in Kingswinford, Staffordshire.

Agenoria was probably the first locomotive to use <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubrication</b> for its axles. The boiler was 10 feet in length and four feet in diameter. The locomotive featured an extremely tall chimney of height 14 feet and 4 inches - this being the most immediately obvious difference between Agenoria and The Stourbridge Lion, which had a shorter chimney. The railway opened on 2 June 1829, the opening being described in Aris's Birmingham Gazette. The track, of standard gauge, was around three miles in length but featured two inclined planes that were too steep for the Agenoria to climb so the locomotive worked about two miles of near-level track. On the opening day, which according to Aris's Gazette, took place [...] "amidst an immense concourse of spectators from the surrounding country", the locomotive first pulled eight carriages filled with 360 passengers along the level section {{at a rate of}} 7.5 miles an hour.

First: they were both added with shorted flues and added with combustion chambers. They were also both added with a draft fan, driven by a steam turbine. Stokers and water level controls were added so the locomotives could be left alone for a long time. This gave both locos the name [...] "Automatic Switcher". <b>Mechanical</b> <b>lubrication</b> was added so {{it was easier to}} maintain the parts that are hard to lubricate. Both of the engines tenders were modified to haul 20 tons of coal and 11,000 gallons of water. There were mechanical issues with this experiment however, so it didn't last very long. The draft fan would be occasionally damaged, because of the cinders. Ashes would also shoot out of the stack, so the crew was vulnerable to get covered. #1112 was added also with more heating surface, increasing the boiler pressure to 225 pounds. A cinder collector was added in front of the exhaust fan to collect cinders and bring them back to the firebox. But this experiment was still a big bust. Sadly, both #1100 and #1112 were retired in 1951, nearly ten years before the N&W gave up steam power in 1960.|$|E

Consequently, NZR chose to order 16 steam locomotives from North British {{to the design of}} the successful J class. These locomotives contained a number of differences to both the J class and Hillside JAs - although turned out with the cross-compound pump, roller bearings on the rods were limited to the connection between the connecting and driving rod, <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubrication</b> was employed. In January 1951 the order had been made for the 16 JA to be more coal burners, and North British regarded the order as essentially a repeat order, virtually identical to 1939 J, but in April 1951 the NZR CME requested the order to be changed to oil burning due to perceived long term coal shortage due to the waterfront strike and the associated strike by miners and unavailability of shipping for coal and the expected long term high imported coal price and the long time it would take to build up coal stocks to safe levels, and the class were built as oil burners, with no grate, ash pan or fire door (the only class of locomotives on the NZR to be built completely as oil burners)and ACFL blow down was incorporated late in their construction. A significant improvement was the incorporation of French T.I.A, blow down equipment which enabled rapid ejection of boiler sludge and reduced the boiler scale, enabling much faster turnaround and higher availability. The system of injection of the oil flow into the burners is different and far more effective than in NZR 1948-50 conversion of 12 Js to oil burning. Other detail differences was the use of Stone's headlights and electrical generator instead of the usual Pyle National equipment, the [...] "Butterfly" [...] number boards on the front headlight, and the lack of smokebox number plate (although a smokebox plate was specified by the NZR).|$|E
40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the Department of Energy, the NASA Lewis Research Center manages a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Technology (HDET) research program. The overall program objectives are {{to reduce fuel consumption}} through increased engine efficiency, reduce engine exhaust emissions, and provide options for the use of alternative fuels. The program is administered with a balance of research contracts, university research grants, and focused in-house research. The Cummins Engine Company participates in the HDET program under a cost-sharing research contract. Cummins is researching and developing in-cylinder component technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. An objective of the Cummins research is to develop technologies for a low-emissions, 55 -percent thermal efficiency (LE- 55) engine. The best current-production engines in this class achieve about 46 -percent thermal efficiency. Federal emissions regulations are driving this technology. Regulations for heavy duty diesel engines were tightened in 1994, more demanding emissions regulations are scheduled for 1998, and another step is planned for 2002. The LE- 55 engine emissions goal is set at half of the 1998 regulation level and is consistent with plans for 2002 emissions regulations. LE- 55 engine design requirements to meet the efficiency target dictate a need to operate at higher peak cylinder pressures. A key technology being developed and evaluated under the Cummins Engine Company LE- 55 engine concept is the spherical joint piston and connecting rod. Unlike conventional piston and connecting rod arrangements which are joined by a pin forming a hinged joint, the spherical joint piston and connecting rod use a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-and-socket arrangement enables the piston to have an axisymmetric design allowing rotation within the cylinder. The potential benefits of piston symmetry and rotation are reduced scuffing, improved piston ring sealing, improved <b>lubrication,</b> <b>mechanical</b> and thermal load symmetry, reduced bearing stresses, reduced running clearances, and reduced oil consumption. The spherical joint piston is a monolithic, squeeze-cast, fiber-reinforced aluminum piston. The connecting rod has a ball end that seats on a spherical saddle within the piston and is retained by a pair of aluminum bronze holder rings. The holder rings are secured by a threaded ring that mates with the piston. As part of the ongoing research and development activity, the Cummins Engine Company successfully completed a 100 -hr test of the spherical joint piston and connecting rod at LE- 55 peak steady-state engine conditions. In addition, a 100 -hr transient cycle test that varied engine conditions between LE- 55 no-load and LE- 55 full-load was successfully completed...|$|R
40|$|Induction {{motor driven}} {{mechanical}} transmission systems are widely utilised in many applications across numerous sectors including industry, power generation and transportation. They are however subject to common failure modes primarily associated with faults in the driven mechanical components. Notably, gearboxes, couplings and bearings can cause significant defects {{in both the}} electrical and mechanical systems. Condition monitoring (CM) undertakes {{a key role in}} the detection of potential defects in the early development stages and in turn avoiding catastrophic operational and financial consequences caused by unplanned breakdowns. Meanwhile, variable speed drives (VSDs) have been increasingly deployed in recent years to achieve accurate speed control and higher operational efficiency. Among the different speed control designs, sensorless VSDs deliver improved dynamic performance and obviate speed measurement devices. This solution however results in heightened noise levels and continual changes in the power supply parameters that potentially impede the detection of minute fault features. This study addresses the gap identified through a systematic review of the literature on the monitoring of mechanical systems utilise induction motors (IM) with sensorless VSDs. Specifically, existing techniques prove ineffective for common mechanical faults that develop in gearboxes and friction induced scenarios. The primary aim of this research centres on the development of a more effective and accurate diagnostic solution for VSD systems using the data available in a VSD. An experimental research approach is based to model and simulate VSD systems under different fault conditions and gather in-depth data on changes in electrical supply parameters: current, voltage and power. Corresponding techniques including model based methods and dynamic signature analysis methods were developed for extracting the changes from noise measurements. An observer based detection technique is developed based on speed and flux observers that are deployed to generate power residuals. Both static and dynamic techniques are incorporated for the first time in order to detect the <b>mechanical</b> misalignment and <b>lubrication</b> degradation, each with different degrees of severities. The results of this study demonstrate that observer based approaches utilising power residual signalling can be effective in the identification of different faults in the monitoring of sensorless VSD driven mechanical systems. Specifically, the combination between dynamic and static components of the power supply parameters and control data has proved effective in separating the four types of common faults: shaft misalignment, lubricant shortage, viscosity changes and water contamination. The static data based approach outperforms the dynamic data based approach in detecting shaft misalignments under sensorless operating modes. The dynamic components of power signals, however, records superior results in the detection of different oil degradation problems. Nevertheless, static components of torque related variables, power and voltage can be used jointly in separating the three tested lubricant faults...|$|R
40|$|Eliminating a Major Cause of Wire Drawing Breakage in A- 15 High-Field Superconductors Phase 1 Summary Purpose of the research: The Phase 1 {{goal was}} to make a {{significant}} improvement in the wire drawing technology used for difficult to draw superconductor precursor composites. Many ductile Nb-Al and Nb-Sn precursor wire composites have experienced the onset of wire drawing breakage at about 1. 5 mm diameter. Phase 1 focused on evaluating the role that precision rigid guidance of the wire into the drawing die and the hydrostatic stress state at the die entrance played in preventing wire breakage. Research carried out: The research performed depended upon the construction of both a mechanical wire guide and a hydrostatic pressure stiffened wire guidance system. Innovare constructed the two wire guidance systems and tested them for their ability to reduce wire drawing breakage. One set of hardware provided rigid alignment of the wires to their wire drawing die axes within 0. 35 degrees using ''hydrostatic pressure stiffening'' to enable the precision guidance strategy to be implemented for these highly flexible small diameter wires. This apparatus was compared to a guide arrangement that used short span mechanical guide alignment with a misalignment limit of about 0. 75 degrees. Four A- 15 composite wires with breakage histories were drawn to evaluate the use of these wire guiding systems to reduce and/or eliminate wire breakage. Research findings and results: In Phase 1, a breakthrough in wire drawing technology for A- 15 superconductor composites was achieved by dramatically limiting or eliminating breakage in four different A- 15 composite precursor wire designs during the drawing of these very desirable composites that previously could not be drawn to near final size. Research results showed that the proposed Phase 1 mechanical wire guides were sufficiently effective and successful in eliminating breakage when used along with other advanced wire drawing technology to justify the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced Wire Drawing Station. New insights into the formation and growth of a shear type defect that causes breakage lead to improved drawing technology and it will be the basis for further study and improvements included in a Phase 2 proposal. Potential application of the research: This new capability now justifies the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced Wire Drawing Station to replace the bulky, slower and research oriented equipment that currently uses four independent operations for each wire diameter reduction. In a Phase 2 proposal, the designs for each operation were to be optimized for their performance and so they could be used to integrate these individual operations into an Advanced Wire Drawing Station. This station will perform all the <b>mechanical</b> conditioning, cleaning, <b>lubrication,</b> guidance and drawing operations simultaneously and it will be tested to verify wire drawing performance targets. A portable Advanced Wire Drawing Station will be developed and constructed in the final stage of the proposed Phase 2 program and it will be used in an outside manufacturing facility for superconductor composite wire drawing field trials...|$|R

This article gives a brief introduction for the instruments and reagents to determine the petroleum products. During the process to determine the kinematic viscosity of petroleum products; the choosing, using and setting position of capillary viscometer and the mercury thermometer will greatly influence the determination of the kinematic viscosity. And the article analyzes these effects and stressed the matters of attention. Kinematic viscosity {{is one of the}} important indexes for the fluid petroleum products, and the determination of which has important and practical significance for lubricating oil or motor fuel such as gasoline, kerosene or diesel oil. For the lubricating oil, the viscosity will influence the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubrication,</b> equipment oil supply and the difficulty of the engine starts, and is first deciding factor to choose equipment oil, as well as the standard to divide the oil brands. For the engine fuel, viscosity directly affects the atomization, the uniformity coefficient of the atomization distribution and the burning effect of the fuel in the engine; as a result {{it is one of the}} important evaluation indexes of the engine fuel coefficient...|$|E
40|$|A host of {{significant}} {{processes in the}} life and physical sciences (e. g., biological recognition, heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubrication)</b> are controlled by interfacial architectures. The origins {{of many of these}} macroscopic interfacial processes are controlled by the molecular level interactions at condensed phase interfaces. The development of methods that can detect differences in the composition and orientational disposition of these architectures at high spatial resolution is therefore technologically important. With the invention {{and the development of a}} range of techniques commonly called scanning probe microscopy (SPM), probing details of the interfaces at a molecular length scale has now become a reality. SPM is extensively used in the field of organothiolate monolayers. The relatively convenient manipulation of surface architectures and control of the interfacial properties of the monolayers have allowed many variants of SPM to map the chemical distribution of surface functional groups, exploiting a range of interfacial properties (e. g., friction and adhesion) as contrast mechanisms at nanometer length scale. In an attempt to develop a better understanding of the monolayer formation process, the spatial distribution of differing chemical functional groups within the monolayer, and the orientation of the end-groups, this dissertation described the insights gained from SPM with those from macroscopic characterization techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and electrochemistry. Four studies are presented. Common to the body of this work is the use of voltammetric reductive desorption and variants of SPM to gain insight into the nature of the monolayer formation process as well as the resulting interface...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVegetable oil {{was one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{lubricating}} oil before the discovery of petroleum. Nowadays, due to vegetable oil's poor performance at high temperatures and oxidation, it has not been widely used in the industrial sector. However, the fatty acids contained in vegetable oils may significantly reduce the frictional coefficient. To optimize lubrication, vegetable oil can be mixed with mineral oil. In this paper, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) was mixed in mineral oil and it lubricating properties were tested. Palm oil is one of the major vegetable oils produced in the world, and PFAD is one of the by-products of the palm oil refinery process. It is classified as a non-edible oil, and therefore, the increased use of this product for <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubrication</b> would not affect the production of cooking oil, the food chain or increase food prices. The mixing percentage (PFAD to mineral oil) varies from 5 % to 25 % of the total mass. Testing was conducted using a four-ball tribotester accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard 4172. The results show that by mixing a 20 % total mass of palm oil in the mineral oil, the coefficient of friction reached its lowest value. The wear scars on the ball bearings lubricated with this mix of oil also showed acceptable diameter values when compared to other conditions. From these results, it can be concluded that the performance of the mineral oil could be enhanced by mixing it with vegetable oil (instead of mineral oil). However, the percentages should be determined properly...|$|E
