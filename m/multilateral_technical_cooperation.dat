40|$|The Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun Dr Ismail Abdul Rahman {{suggested}} in the early 1970 s that Malaysia should {{have a role in}} the development of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. Accordingly, the Center for the Application of Nuclear Energy (CRANE) was established, with a focus on the development of a scientific and technical pool critical to a national nuclear power program. The Malaysian Cabinet next established the Tun Ismail Atomic Research Center (TIARC) under the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment on 19 September 1972, at a site in Bangi, about 35 km south of Kuala Lampur. On 28 June 1982, the PUSPATI reactor, a 1 -MW TRIGA MK-II research reactor, first reached criticality. On 10 August 1994, TIARC was officially renamed as the Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology Research (MINT). In addition to radioisotope production and neutron radiography conducted at the PUSPATI research reactor, MINT also supports numerous programs employing nuclear technology for medicine, agriculture and industry, and has been involved in both bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> to extend its capabilities. As an energy exporting country, Malaysia has felt little incentive to develop a nuclear energy program, and high level opposition within the government discouraged it further. A recent statement by Malaysia's Science, Technology and Innovation Minister supported this view, indicating that only a near-catastrophic jump in world oil prices might change the government's view. However, the rate at which Malaysia is using its natural gas and oil reserves is expected to force it to reassess the role of nuclear energy in the near future. In addition, the government does intend to construct a radioactive waste repository to dispose of naturally occurring radioactive materials (extracted during tin mining, in particular). Also, Malaysia's growing economy could encourage expansion in Malaysia's existing nuclear-applications programs supporting the medical, agricultural, industrial and environmental fields...|$|E
25|$|The {{dispute over}} water {{resources}} was finally resolved by intense diplomatic negotiations. In October 1979, the Itaipú–Corpus <b>Multilateral</b> Treaty on <b>Technical</b> <b>Cooperation</b> was concluded, ending the dispute {{to the satisfaction}} of all three neighbors and opening the way for a dramatic improvement in relations. After the conclusion of the Itaipu–Corpus Treaty, Brazilian president João Figueiredo visited Argentina, the first Brazilian leader to do so in more than four decades.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the CIS {{countries}} have received very significant amounts of technical assistance from international development organizations and bilateral donors. While this has played a positive and important role in the transformation of these societies, practically all stakeholders currently share the opinion that many problems have accumulated in the area of <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> with CIS countries. This paper intends to outline these problems, analyze their underlying reasons - including the changing environment for <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the CIS - and the interaction of the interests of beneficiaries, donors and providers in the process of implementing <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> projects. The analysis suggests that a good understanding, recognition and coordination of the interests of all TC stakeholders and a reduction in the information gap between the various participants in the <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> process are necessary for improving the effectiveness of <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> <b>technical</b> assistance, <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation,</b> TC effectiveness, CIS...|$|R

The results may not be sustainable if, for example, the planning authority {{that depends on the}} <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> loses access to top management, or is not provided with adequate resources after the <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> ends.

40|$|A major {{cornerstone}} {{on the way}} to low-carbon {{sustainable development}} on a global scale will be a swift and effective implementation of all countries' INDCs submitted to the UNFCCC prior to Paris. However, doing so will require transforming development pathways away from currently pervasive carbon lock-ins. This can only be successful if countries take a systemic view on their development agendas, and link mitigation, adaptation and other developmental priorities together for a coherent overarching sustainable development strategy. The ownership for this process needs to be with the countries themselves as such strategies touch fundamentally upon national policy-making and implementation. At the same time, developing countries have access to bi- and <b>multilateral</b> financial and <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> To enable a systemic, country-led perspective, development cooperation needs to shift its paradigms away from currently prevalent project-level interventions. A truly innovative and transformational shift with the objective of pursuing a low-carbon and climate resilient society needs to open up space for experimentation as new ways of doing things need to be put into practice. Experiments will not always be successful, but foster learning on a national as well as an international level on pitfalls and solutions in new approaches to low-carbon sustainable development. Not least, {{there needs to be a}} renewed focus on programmatic approaches that link various topical domains for a country-led process, and a critical look at development work that is "doomed to succeed". Our article draws from systems theory, development studies and recent work on transitions studies and transformational change in the international domain. It links up different theoretical concepts with practical approaches in order to outline a future development agenda that will be owned by developing countries and supported non-invasively by bi- and multilateral development cooperation to foster low-carbon development pathways that are urgently needed to solve the climate crisis...|$|R
