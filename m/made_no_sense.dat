25|$|When Chen Tai was {{retreating}} back to Longxi Commandery, {{he predicted}} that Jiang Wei {{would attempt to}} make use of the mountainous terrain along the way to lay an ambush, so he took a southern detour back to Longxi Commandery. As he expected, Jiang Wei had indeed sent troops to lie in ambush for three days. However, the historian Pei Songzhi pointed out that it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Jiang Wei to set up the ambush because he did not know that Wei reinforcements would show up when he was besieging Didao so the ambush would not have served its purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{claimed that}} prior Court rulings on tax payment regulations were not applicable because the 1862 the law specifically required payment {{to be made}} in person, but the Court disagreed and distinguished its previous decisions as being based on the 1862 law and its 1863 amendments. The government also claimed that the law did not permit payment to be made between the announcement of the tax sale and the date of the sale if the government were the purchaser. But the majority pointed out that this created a contradiction: How could the title holder know that the government was the purchaser until the actual purchase had occurred? This <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense,</b> and subsequently that section of the law was invalid.|$|E
25|$|Navajo was an {{attractive}} choice for code use because few {{people outside the}} Navajo had learned to speak the language. Virtually no books in Navajo had been published. Outside of the language, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards. It would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers could have worked together effectively. The Japanese {{had an opportunity to}} attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code talker, was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to him. When he reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.|$|E

25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense,</b> commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.|$|E
25|$|With The Rock {{defeating}} Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin {{was set to}} face The Rock at WrestleMania. In {{the weeks}} leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis, even sharing a beer with him and turning heel for the first time since 1997. This decision has been highly criticised by many, including Austin himself, as Austin was such a top-level face that many agreed it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to turn him heel.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} a [...] "sizzling" [...] beat. The song is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's previous single [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] (2007). The rock-tinged song opens with a horror movie-like scream, followed by the hook [...] "Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum" [...] which has been likened to the [...] "Ella-ella-ella-ey-ey" [...] hook from [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007). BBC News interpreted it as Rihanna singing about being frightened but felt that its lyrics <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E

500|$|Port Moresby became {{congested}} in September 1942. This {{represented a}} dangerous situation, so procedures were instituted whereby ships would wait at Townsville until called forward. Due {{to lack of}} capacity at Port Moresby, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for ships to travel in convoy, so they sailed to and from Port Moresby individually or in small groups. Convoys to New Guinea did not commence until December 1942. Turnaround time for ships from Townsville to Port Moresby was 11 to 13 days, of which 5 to 7 days was spent awaiting discharge in Port Moresby. Some 125 ship voyages were made to Port Moresby between May and November 1942. During 1942, 3,033 vehicles, 199 guns and [...] of stores were shipped to New Guinea.|$|E

On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his [...] "BS detector to go off the scale". Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense,</b> but the couple were desperate. In {{the second week of}} June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Writing for Tor.com, Keith DeCandido {{questioned}} why the shuttlebay wasn't guarded, comparing it to a similar situation in [...] episode, [...] "". He also felt that the sequence where the shuttle is bounced off an atmosphere resembled the [...] "Premiere" [...] episode of Farscape, an odd criticism considering this episode aired some 11 years before the Farscape episode. [...] DeCandido said that the exam <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense,</b> and that there were no surprises as it was obvious that Wesley and Picard were not due to leave the series. Despite Remmick representing [...] "the ultimate cliché of the jackass interrogator", DeCandido liked the episode. [...] He credited the strong performance by the cast and called Wheaton's performance the best of the first season. DeCandido gave the episode a score of five out of ten.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{discusses}} morphology, {{including the}} importance of homologous structures. He says, [...] "What can be more curious than that {{the hand of a}} man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?" [...] This <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the [...] "explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications" [...] showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.|$|E
500|$|A much {{different}} {{origin of the}} song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck {{with him for a}} bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang [...] "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] to something else since every lyric before yellow <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just {{to move on to the}} next question.

500|$|The 747 {{enjoyed a}} fairly smooth {{introduction}} into service, overcoming concerns that some airports {{would not be}} able to accommodate an aircraft that large. Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved. After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service. [...] Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity. [...] While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747. Nonetheless, many flag-carriers purchased the 747 due to its iconic status [...] "even if it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> economically" [...] to operate. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|Nosanchuk {{gave his}} final {{statement}} to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ...|$|E

500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E
500|$|Graham {{was happy}} with the episode himself and {{received}} letters from [...] "loads of kids" [...] who enjoyed it. When discovering that older fans had reacted negatively, he thought, [...] "Well, it's a shame that they have, but it wasn't meant for them". IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a 5 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "flat and formulaic" [...] and everything about it was [...] "slightly underwhelming", though he thought what did work was the mother-daughter teamwork at the end. He also noted [...] "annoying self-aggrandizing moments that <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> and served only to make the episode feel unnecessarily campy", such as the audience disappearing from the stadium and the Doctor carrying the torch. Comparing the episode to [...] "The Idiot's Lantern" [...] in terms of plot, {{he felt that the}} latter was [...] "far more entertaining" [...] and that [...] "Fear Her" [...] lacked originality and humour. Dave Bradley of SFX awarded [...] "Fear Her" [...] three out of five stars, describing the plot as [...] "ordinary" [...] but thought it was [...] "a decent breather before grander adventures to come". He particularly praised the dialogue and thought [...] "the claustrophobic effect of limiting the action to one household works". Arnold T Blumburg, writing for Now Playing, gave the episode a grade of B+. He felt that the guest cast were [...] "only just adequate" [...] and that the story [...] "plods along in places", but the story worked because of the [...] "delightful" [...] interactions between the Doctor and Rose and the feel-good ending.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{inevitable}} punishment {{of the rebels}} had occurred, the Persians were {{in the mood for}} conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. [...] Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.|$|E

He predicted the investigation would likely last as long as the President was in office and beyond.

With WCW programming canceled (and Viacom subsequently no longer objecting), the company's key choice of assets (tape library, trademarks, and selected contracts) were purchased by the WWF in March 2001 for a substantially lower price (approximately US $3.5 million) than what had been offered.|$|R
