40|$|Barber and Ursell (1948) {{measured}} frequency {{spectra of}} ocean waves {{in order to}} develop a reliable method of predicting amplitude and period of wind waves and swell from <b>meteorological</b> <b>charts</b> and forecasts. The stroboscopic view of the sea state offered by the series of measured wave spectra at two locations off the east coast of England in their paper provide some useful insights. First, the waves will grow and decay with time at any particular point on the ocean surface. Secondly, the ocean surface is usually covered simultaneously by many wave systems of different nature, but often, predominant systems can be categorized as wind waves and swells. (Wind waves, or a sea, are generated by the wind blowing over a local area of the observer. The swell is generated in a distant storm. So, in general, swell travels in a direction different from that of sea.) Thirdly, the waves are likely to be different at different points on the ocean surface at any time. So the sea states encountered by a moving ship are constantly changing. Classification societies and navies are concerned about how best to incorporate this fact into the design codes for ships. Researchers, mainly oceanographers, have addressed the question of how the energy of ocean waves is distributed with respect to direction of propagation. For stationary offshore structures, the directional spectrum can be measured at the site. But they have not developed a model that takes into account th...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of tropospheric ozone depletion event (ODE) studies have focussed on time-series measurements, with comparatively few {{studies of the}} vertical component. Those that exist have almost exclusively used free-flying balloon-borne ozonesondes and almost all have been conducted in the Arctic. Here we use measurements from two separate Antarctic field experiments to examine the vertical profile of ozone during Antarctic ODEs. We use tethersonde data to probe details in the lowest few hundred meters and find considerable structure in the profiles associated with complex atmospheric layering. The profiles were all measured at wind speeds less than 7 ms − 1, and on each occasion the lowest inversion height lay between 10 m and 40 m. We also use data from a free-flying ozonesonde study to select events where ozone depletion was recorded at altitudes > 1 km above ground level. Using ERA- 40 <b>meteorological</b> <b>charts,</b> we find that on every occasion the high altitude depletion was preceded by an atmospheric low pressure system. An examination of limited published ozonesonde data from other Antarctic stations shows {{this to be a}} consistent feature. Given the link between BrO and ODEs, we also examine ground-based and satellite BrO measurements and find a strong association between atmospheric low pressure systems and enhanced BrO that must arise in the troposphere. The results suggest that, in Antarctica, such depressions are responsible for driving high altitude ODEs and for generating the large-scale BrO clouds observed from satellites. In the Arctic, the prevailing meteorology differs from that in Antarctica, but, while a less common effect, major low pressure systems in the Arctic can also generate BrO clouds. Such depressions thus appear to be fundamental when considering the broader influence of ODEs, certainly in Antarctica, such as halogen export and the radiative influence of ozone-depleted air masses...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe HYDROPTIMET {{case studies}} (9 ? 10 June 2000 Catalogne, 8 ? 9 September 2002 Cévennes and 24 ? 26 November 2002 Piémont) appear to {{encompass}} {{a sort of}} prototype flash-flood situations in the western Mediterranean attending to the relevant synoptic and mesoscale signatures identified on the <b>meteorological</b> <b>charts.</b> In Catalogne, the convective event was driven by a low-pressure system of relatively small dimensions developed over the mediterranean coast of Spain that moved into southern France. For Cévennes, the main circulation pattern was a synoptic-scale Atlantic low which induced a persistent southerly low-level jet (LLJ) over the western Mediterranean, strengthened by the Alps along its western flank, which guaranteed continuous moisture supply towards southern France where the long-lived, quasistationary convective system developed. The long Piémont episode, very representative of the most severe alpine flash flood events, shares some similarities with the Cévennes situation during its first stage {{in that it was}} controlled by a southerly moist LLJ associated with a large-scale disturbance located to the west. However, these circulation features were transient aspects and {{during the second half of}} the episode the situation was dominated by a cyclogenesis process over the Mediterranean which gave place to a mesoscale-size depression at surface that acted to force new heavy rain over the slopes of the Alps and maritime areas. That is, the Piémont episode can be catalogued as of mixed type with regard to the responsible surface disturbance, evolving from a large-scale pattern with remote action (like Cévennes) to a mesoscale pattern with local action (like Catalogne). A prominent mid-tropospheric trough or cut-off low can be identified in all events prior and during the period of heavy rain, which clearly served as the precursor agent for the onset of the flash-flood conditions and the cyclogenesis at low-levels. Being aware of the uncertainty in the representation of the upper-level disturbance and the necessity to cope with it within the operational context when attempting to issue short to mid-range numerical weather predictions of these high impact weather events, a systematic exploration of the predictability of the three selected case studies subject to uncertainties in the representation of the upper-level precursor disturbance is carried out in this paper. The study is based on an ensemble of mesoscale numerical simulations of each event with the MM 5 non-hydrostatic model after perturbing in a systematic way the upper-level disturbance, in the sense of displacing slightly this disturbance upstream/downstream along the zonal direction and intensifying/weakening its amplitude. These perturbations are guided by a previous application of the MM 5 -adjoint model, which consistently shows high sensitivities of the dynamical control of the heavy rain to the flow configuration about the upper-level disturbance on the day before, thus confirming the precursor characteristics of this agent. The perturbations are introduced to the initial conditions by applying a potential vorticity (PV) inversion procedure to the positive PV anomaly associated with the upper-level disturbance, and then using the inverted fields (wind, temperature and geopotential) to modify under a physically consistent balance the model initial fields. The results generally show that the events dominated by mesoscale low-level disturbances (Catalogne and last stage of the Piémont episode) are very sensitive to the initial uncertainties, such that the heavy rain location and magnitude are in some of the experiments strongly changed in response to the "forecast errors" of the cyclone trajectory, intensity, shape and translational speed. In contrast, the other situations (Cévennes and initial stage of the Piémont episode), dominated by a larger scale system wich basically acts to guarantee the establishment and persistence of the southerly LLJ towards the southern France-north Italy orography, exhibit much higher predictability. That is, the slight modifications in the LLJ direction and intensity encompassed by the ensemble of perturbed forecasts are less critical with respect to the heavy precipitation potential and affected area...|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Smythe was {{selected}} to proceed to Fiji as commissioner to inquire into {{the circumstances of the}} cession of Fiji to England, which an English consul, Mr. W. T. Pritchard, had obtained from King Cakobau, and into the value of the group of islands from a strategical as well as a commercial point of view. The botanist, Dr. Berthold Carl Seemann, was attached to the mission.Smythe, accompanied by his wife, left England on 16 Jan. 1860, taking with him complete sets of magnetical and <b>meteorological</b> instruments and <b>charts.</b> After experiencing some difficulty of transport owing to the war in New Zealand, he arrived in a small sailing vessel at Levuka on 5 July. He visited all the larger islands, and ascertained that there was no organised opposition to the cession; but he found that the representations made to government as to the value of the islands were in many substantial particulars incorrect, while Thakombau was in no sense king of Fiji. Foreseeing a tolerably long detention in the islands, Smythe brought with him to Levuka materials for a small house, which was erected, and part of it was fitted as an observatory. Here, from 12 Jan. to 30 April 1861, he made regular magnetical and meteorological observations, including very careful determinations of magnetic declination, inclination, and force. Although not the first good observations made at Fiji, Smythe's are the most extensive and complete, and will probably long remain the standard of comparison.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:Continuous {{surface ozone}} {{measurements}} and regular ECC ozone sonde launches were used, {{in order to}} study the dynamical processes during the formation of tropospheric ozone depletion events at Neumayer Station (70 °S; 08 °W) in 1992 and 1993. <b>Meteorological</b> data, weather <b>charts,</b> ice charts as well as trajectory calculations have been considered for this analysis. Altogether eight events of surface ozone minima were recorded, four of them from June to August 1992 and another four in the period from August to September in 1993, respectively. The duration of these low ozone events was about 1 - 2 days. During this time ozone mixing ratios varied between 8 ppbv and 24 ppbv. Ozone sonde data showed that those ozone poor layers were restricted to the planetary boundary layer up to a subsidence inversion, indicating their upper limit. In general, those ozone poor air masses were exposed by sunlight during transport across the ice covered Southern Ocean. Beside these general features, typical cases could be identified which might {{be explained by the}} special dynamical conditions in the Antarctic coastal region. In September 1993 two events with an elevated ozone poor layer were observed due to the influence of continental winds. In June 1992 an ozone minimum was also detected at Neumayer Station during polar night conditions. In this case the ozone depleted air mass was probably transported from sunlit regions located northward from Neumayer Station where the exposure by sunlight occurred...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{sensitivity}} to buried archaeological structures of C- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in various polarisations. In particular, single and dual polarised data from the Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) sensor on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) is used, together with quadruple polarised (quad pol) data from the SAR sensor on Radarsat- 2. The study region includes an isolated area of open fields in the eastern outskirts of Rome where buried structures are documented to exist. Processing of the SAR data involved multitemporal averaging, analysis of target decompositions, study of the polarimetric signatures over areas of suspected buried structures and changes of the polarimetric bases in an attempt to enhance their visibility. Various ancillary datasets were obtained for the analysis, including geological and lithological <b>charts,</b> <b>meteorological</b> data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), optical imagery and an archaeological chart. For the Radarsat- 2 data analysis, results show that the technique of identifying the polarimetric bases that yield greatest backscatter over anomaly features, and subsequently changing the polarimetric bases of the time series, succeeded in highlighting features of interest in the study area. It appeared possible that some of the features could correspond with structures documented on the reference archaeological chart, but there was not a clear match between the chart and the results of the Radarsat- 2 analysis. A similar conclusion was reached for the PALSAR data analysis. For the PALSAR data, the volcanic nature of the soil may have hindered the visibility of traces of buried features. Given the limitations of the accuracy of the archaeological chart and the spatial resolution of both the SAR datasets, further validation would be required to draw any precise conclusions on the sensitivity of the SAR data to buried structures. Such a validation could include geophysical prospection or excavation...|$|R
