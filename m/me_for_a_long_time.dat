500|$|Bannon was 22years {{old when}} she began writing her first pulp novel. She was {{influenced}} by the only lesbian novels she had read, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall from 1928 and Vin Packer's Spring Fire from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel, but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of Spring Fire. Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them. In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said, [...] "I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> down on paper." ...|$|E
500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E
2500|$|I have {{concerned}} {{myself with}} him since autumn 1998. Not, {{as has been}} claimed, to get him doping products. Everybody knows perfectly, starting with the policemen who have listened to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> that riders don't need me {{for that sort of}} thing. To the contrary. If they turn to me, it's because they've heard of what I {{have been able to do}} [...] for the great stars I have cited.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> moment, {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|R
60|$|He took <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk {{to break}} it to me, over the hills towards Yare and across the great gorse commons by Hazelbrow.|$|R

2500|$|Lata {{considered}} Asha's act of eloping {{with her}} lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone {{to sing and}} earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Asha herself stated in an interview– [...] "It was a love marriage and Lata didi did not speak to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> She disapproved of the alliance." [...] At one time, their relationship was very adversarial {{and there have been}} periods of non-communication.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> and he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy {{to take advantage of this}} weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

60|$|Then {{as though}} to change the subject, she talked to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while about Kôr, of which she told me a most {{interesting}} history, true or false, that I omit here.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the best}} turn the earl has done <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time," [...] the man replied. [...] "Never did I have a job I fancied less than the tending of that evil {{tempered}} brute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{something}} on my mind," [...] said Mr. Heard, with a diabolical {{glance at the}} mate--"something wot's been worrying <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I've been deceiving you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And as you've known <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> you know,' said Mr Toots, 'let me {{assure you}} that {{she is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} women that ever lived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{repeated}} softly, [...] "I don't understand myself. You've known <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> Andrew. You wouldn't write me down as altogether a sentimental ass, would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course, Richard, I couldn't {{think of}} having {{any of your}} money to go away from you with! I don't want any either. I have enough of my own to last <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, and Jude will let me have--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Arrested, {{it might}} be, in his general assurance, Hugh {{wondered}} and smiled. [...] "Mine--collectors? Oh, I'm afraid I haven't any--to speak of. Only it {{has seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time," [...] he added, [...] "that on that head we should all feel together." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a mystic, she {{reported}} that she heard God telling her: [...] "Ask <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> suffering life and to write a lot... That's your mission on earth". She never claimed direct visions of Jesus and Mary but spoke of Jesus through her prayers and meditations.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man looked}} at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before he spoke. There was a puzzled {{expression}} upon his wrinkled face, and a look of hurt sorrow in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, evil beast," [...] {{said the}} woman, with a chuckle, [...] "you won't bite me any more; you'll {{forget all about}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Look at him, Ibubesi, look at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Sari I became lost, and then the Sagoths discovered <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> I eluded them, hiding in caves and wading in rivers to throw them off my trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was no {{laughing}} matter, I {{can tell}} you," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "though doubtless it {{will serve as}} a standing jest against <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time; however, I am so thankful I have got out of the scrape that those may laugh who will." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went to bed}} greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time; {{and when}} one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in her arms, after that, and slept soundly.|$|R
5000|$|In a November 2007 {{interview}} with The Ann Arbor News, Morris recalled: [...] "Once Coach Bo was chastising me, and (assistant coach Lloyd Carr) pointed out, 'Look at those younger players over there. He's not yelling at them, so he must think something about you.' And that held with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." ...|$|R
60|$|I took a {{few steps}} back, and he then opened the door {{sufficiently}} to allow his head to come through. He said nothing, but he looked at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in a very searching manner.|$|E
60|$|As I stood dreaming {{beside the}} giant {{thing that had}} brought me safely through the earth's crust, my {{traveling}} companion, the hideous Mahar, emerged from {{the interior of the}} prospector and stood beside <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> she remained motionless.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall lose my place. Mr Bickersdyke {{has wanted}} to get rid of <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> He never liked me. I shall be dismissed. What can I do?

60|$|Tony made a {{struggling}} noise in his throat, then coughed and groaned. From somewhere he was reappearing. I noticed Mr. Pike {{look at him}} quickly, as if apprehending some recrudescence of frenzy that would require more boat-stretcher. But Tony merely fluttered his big black eyes open and stared at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> minute of incurious amaze ere he closed them again.|$|R
60|$|He {{blinked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, his eyes running full of tears again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Six-and-thirty years ago, this day, my dear,' said my aunt, as {{we walked}} back to the chariot, 'I was married. God forgive us all!' We took our seats in silence; and so she sat beside <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> holding my hand. At length she {{suddenly}} burst into tears, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't, Toussac; don't!' {{said the}} same gentle voice which had spoken first. 'I saw you do it once before, and the horrible snick that it made haunted <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> To think that the sacred flame of life can be so readily snuffed out by that great {{material}} finger and thumb! Mind can indeed conquer matter, but the fighting must not be at close quarters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He fixed <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> without {{replying}} {{and then}} {{spoke with a}} weak extravagance and with such pauses between his words as might have represented the slow prompting of an inner voice. [...] "You asked me when you first knew me what I was. 'Nothing,' I said, 'nothing of any consequence.' Nothing I've always supposed myself to be. But I've wronged myself--I'm a great exception. I'm a haunted man!" ...|$|E
60|$|After this {{there was}} a heavy silence {{broken only by the}} stifled giggles in the {{background}} of Mrs. Scroope and the canon's fluffy-headed wife, who to do her justice had some fun in her. Thank goodness the evening, or rather that part of it did not last long, since presently Mrs. Atterby-Smith, after studying <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while with <b>a</b> cold eye, rose majestically and swept off to bed followed by her offspring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. Living, I suppose. I {{crawled into}} a haystack to sleep one night, {{because it was}} warmer, and along comes a village constable and arrests <b>me</b> <b>for</b> being <b>a</b> tramp. At first they thought I was a runaway, and telegraphed my {{description}} all over. I told them I {{did n't have any}} people, but they would n't believe <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. And then, when nobody claimed me, the judge sent me to a boys' 'refuge' in San Francisco." ...|$|R
6000|$|SECTION XCIV. Eighth side. God {{creating}} Man. Represented as a throned figure, with a glory {{round the}} head, laying {{his left hand}} {{on the head of}} a naked youth, and sustaining him with his right hand.
