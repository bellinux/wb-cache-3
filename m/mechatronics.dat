500|$|In {{a system}} that {{consists}} of multiple energy domains, transfer matrices are required that can handle components with ports in different domains. [...] In robotics and <b>mechatronics,</b> actuators are required. [...] These usually consist of a transducer converting, for instance, signals from the control system in the electrical domain into motion in the mechanical domain. [...] The control system also requires sensors that detect the motion and convert {{it back into the}} electrical domain through another transducer so that the motion can be properly controlled through a feedback loop. Other sensors in the system may be transducers converting yet other energy domains into electrical signals, such as optical, audio, thermal, fluid flow and chemical. [...] Another application is the field of mechanical filters which require transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains in both directions.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are formed}} by {{comparing}} the mathematical description of the two systems. [...] Quantities that appear {{in the same place}} in equations of the same form are called analogues. [...] There are two main reasons for forming such analogies. [...] The first is to allow electrical phenomena to be explained in terms of the more familiar mechanical systems. [...] For instance, an electrical inductor-capacitor-resistor circuit has differential equations of the same form as a mechanical mass-spring-damper system. [...] In such cases the electrical domain is converted to the mechanical domain. [...] The second, and more important, reason is to allow a system containing both mechanical and electrical parts to be analysed as a unified whole. [...] This is of great benefit in the fields of <b>mechatronics</b> and robotics. [...] In such cases the mechanical domain is most often converted to the electrical domain because network analysis in the electrical domain is highly developed.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Mechatronics</b> is a {{combination}} of mechanics and electronics. [...] It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. [...] In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a <b>mechatronics</b> system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.|$|E

[...] The company signed further agreements {{with three other}} (unnamed) European automotive manufacturers to incorporate their components in DCTs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mechanical}} engineering begins {{to merge with}} other disciplines, as seen in <b>mechatronics,</b> multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. [...] MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.|$|E
2500|$|The actual shift {{points are}} {{determined}} by the DSG's transmission ECU, which commands a hydro-mechanical unit. The transmission ECU, combined with the hydro-mechanical unit, are collectively called a <b>mechatronics</b> unit or module. Because the DSG's ECU uses fuzzy logic, the operation of the DSG is said to be adaptive; that is, the DSG will [...] "learn" [...] how the user drives the car, and will progressively tailor the shift points accordingly to suit the habits of the driver.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} {{emerged as}} a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development {{can be traced back}} several thousand years around the world.

2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and <b>mechatronics</b> with fully synthetic specialist automatic transmission fluid (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional hypoid gear oil. This dual circuit lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles.
