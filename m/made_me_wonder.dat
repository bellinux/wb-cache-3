2500|$|Summarizing {{the media}} {{response}} to the speech, Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz wrote, [...] "Not surprisingly, most liberals loved the speech and many conservatives — though not all — lambasted it. ... the reaction {{on the left and}} right sometimes <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> whether these pundits were watching the same speech. The only point of agreement I found is skepticism that it will help Obama with white, working-class voters, sometimes short-handed as Reagan Democrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Then {{the white}} man who had {{introduced}} Sitting Bull arose again {{and said he would}} interpret what the chief had said. [...] He then started telling the audience all about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, generally spoken as the ‘Custer massacre.’ [...] He [...] mentioned how the Sioux were all prepared for battle, and how they had swooped down on Custer and wiped his soldiers all out. [...] He told so many lies that I had to smile. [...] Then {{the white man}} said that all those who wished to shake hands with Sitting Bull would please line up if they cared to meet the man who had killed Custer. [...] It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> what sort of people the whites were, anyway. [...] Perhaps they were glad to have Custer killed, and were really pleased to shake the hand with the man who had killed him!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the film in its original, longer form was almost entirely negative. Many critics responded unfavorably to the film's long running time and sprawling nature. Roger Ebert described the Cannes screening as [...] "The most disastrous since, yes, The Brown Bunny." [...] Salon.com critic Andrew O'Hehir called the Cannes cut [...] "about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen." [...] Jason Solomons, in The Observer (UK), said that [...] "Southland Tales was so bad it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if [...] had ever met a human being" [...] and that ten minutes of the [...] "sprawling, plotless, post-apocalyptic farrago" [...] gave him the [...] "sinking feeling {{that this may be}} one of the worst films ever presented in [...] competition." [...] A handful of the American and European critics, however, were more positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, for example, called Southland Tales [...] "a visionary film about the end of times" [...] comparable in recent American film only to David Lynch's [...] Mulholland Drive.|$|E
60|$|I was {{surprised}} to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> less <b>wonder</b> at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the least title to either.|$|R
60|$|For ten minutes, at least, I {{sat quietly}} {{waiting to see}} what would happen next--very much {{surprised}} at the remark that had been <b>made</b> to <b>me,</b> and <b>wondering</b> at Uncle Beamish's protracted absence. Suddenly he entered the room and closed the door.|$|R
60|$|It's rummy how {{sleeping}} on a thing often makes you feel quite different about it. It's happened to me over and over again. Somehow or other, when I woke next morning the old heart didn't feel half so broken as it had done. It was a perfectly topping day, {{and there was something}} about the way the sun came in at the window and the row the birds were kicking up in the ivy that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> half <b>wonder</b> whether Jeeves wasn't right. After all, though she had a wonderful profile, was it such a catch being engaged to Florence Craye as the casual observer might imagine? Wasn't there something in what Jeeves had said about her character? I began to realise that my ideal wife was something quite different, something a lot more clinging and drooping and prattling, and what not.|$|R

It is a good scheme up to a certain point, of course, although neither your daughter nor myself could be convicted of conspiracy without the production of what we are supposed to have stolen. Still, as I said, it is a good feint, and it has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> curious. I <b>wonder</b> what your real scheme is! I do not think that you will tell me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, when I came to {{the justice}} again, there was Mr Foster of Bedford, who, coming out of another room, and seeing me {{by the light of}} the candle (for it was dark night when I went thither), he said unto me, Who is there? John Bunyan? with such seeming affection, as if he would have leaped on my neck and kissed <b>me,</b> which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{somewhat}} <b>wonder,</b> that such a man as he, with whom I had so little acquaintance, and, besides, that had ever been a close opposer of the ways of God, should carry himself so full of love to me; but, afterwards, when I saw what he did, it caused me to remember those sayings, Their tongues are smoother than oil, but their words are drawn swords. [...] And again, Beware of men, etc. When I had answered him, that blessed be God, I was well; he said, What is the occasion of your being here? or to that purpose. To whom I answered, that I was at a meeting of people a little way off, intending to speak a word of exhortation to them; the justice hearing thereof, said I, was pleased to send his warrant to fetch me before him, etc.|$|R

60|$|As I spoke a {{particularly}} large ball of flame fell from above. It resembled a shooting star or a meteor {{more than anything}} else that I had ever seen, and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> whether we were not perhaps standing beneath some inky, unseen sky.|$|E
60|$|He {{promised me}} {{in a way}} that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if he would ever sleep again or turn his back on anyone--made me wonder too, at the menace in his voice. Steele seemed likely to be torn two ways, and already there was a hint of future desperation.|$|E
60|$|What {{could have}} been Dick's object in telling such a lie? It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder.</b> Perhaps these lumbermen were more {{dangerous}} than I had supposed, and Dick did not wish them to believe I had left Penetier. Maybe he was playing for time, {{and did not want}} them to get alarmed and escape before the officers came.|$|E
60|$|I {{admired the}} skill with which Isabel saved her {{conscience}} in this statement {{too much to}} dispute it; and I suppose that whatever she had said, Miss Gage would have been reassured. I cannot particularly praise the wisdom of her behaviour during that day, or, for the matter of that, the behaviour of Kendricks either. The ideal thing {{would have been for}} him to keep away now till her father came, but {{it seemed to me that}} he was about under our feet all the while, and that she, so far from making him remain at his own hotel, encouraged him to pass the time at ours. Without consulting me, Mrs. March asked him to stay to dinner after he had stayed all the forenoon, and he made this a pretext for spending the afternoon in our corner of the verandah. She <b>made</b> <b>me</b> give it up to him and Miss Gage, so that they could be alone together, though I must say they did not seem to mind us a great deal when we were present; he was always leaning on the back of her chair, or sitting next her with his hand dangling over it in a manner that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sick. I <b>wondered</b> if I was ever such an ass as that, and I quite lost the respect for Kendricks's good sense and good taste which had been the ground of my liking for him.|$|R

60|$|Then the graceful, {{powerful}} Lane, champion batter, champion base runner, {{stepped to}} the plate. How a baseball crowd, any crowd, anywhere, loves the champion batter! The ovation Lane received <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder,</b> with this impressive reception in a hostile camp, {{what could be the}} manner of it on his home field? Any boy ball-player from the lots seeing Lane knock the dirt out of his spikes and step into position would have known he was a 400 hitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the present}} it is {{declined}} without conditions. I {{will be quite}} frank with you. Your offer doesn't shock me as it might do if I were a right-feeling Imperialist of the proper Jingo type. I believe that a week ago I should have considered it very seriously indeed. Its acceptance {{would have been in}} accordance with my beliefs. And yet, since you have made it, you have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> more than ever whether I have been right. I find a revulsion of feeling in considering it, which I cannot understand." ...|$|E

"Well, mother," [...] said Armine, smiling {{back to her}} {{in spite}} of himself, [...] "I have not liked to say so, it seemed a shame; but staying at the Vicarage <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> at my being such an egregious ass last year! Do you know, I couldn't help it; but that good lady {{would seem to me}} quite mawkish in her flattery! And how she does domineer over that poor brother of hers! Then the fuss she makes about details, never seeming to know which are {{accessories}} and which are principles. I don't wonder that I was an absurdity in the eyes of all beholders. But it is very sad if it has really alienated my dear Infanta from all deeper and higher things!" ...|$|E

60|$|One workman, {{home from}} work, sat down {{opposite}} {{me at the}} rough wooden table, and began his meal. A handful of salt on the not over-clean table constituted his butter. Into it he dipped his bread, mouthful by mouthful, and washed it down with tea from a big mug. A piece of fish completed his bill of fare. He ate silently, looking neither to right nor left nor across at me. Here and there, at the various tables, other men were eating, just as silently. In the whole room there was hardly a note of conversation. A feeling of gloom pervaded the ill-lighted place. Many of them sat and brooded over the crumbs of their repast, and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder,</b> as Childe Roland wondered, what evil they had done {{that they should be}} punished so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is sad. Has it not all been sad? But {{what would you have}} me do? It is not because he was always bad to me,--because he marred all my early life, making it so foul a blotch that I hardly dare to look back upon it from the {{quietness}} and comparative purity of these latter days. It is not because he has so treated me as to make me feel that it has been a misfortune to me to be born, that I now receive these tidings with joy. It is because of him who has always been good to me as the other was bad, who has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> at the noble instincts of a man, as the other has made me shudder at his possible meanness." ...|$|E
60|$|As long {{as light}} {{remained}} I watched La Fidélité through the glass, but I {{could see nothing}} but a black form with a slanting upper line. She was becalmed as I was. Why could she not have been becalmed near me? I dared not let my mind rest upon the opportunities I had lost {{when she had been}} becalmed near me. During the night the wind must have risen again, for the Sparhawk rolled and dipped a good deal, troubling my troubled slumbers. Very early in the morning I was awakened by what sounded like a distant scream. I did not know whether it was a dream or not; but I hurried on deck. The sun had not risen, but as I looked about I saw something which took away my breath; which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if I were awake, or dreaming, or mad.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{simplicity}} {{about this}} Irish gentry which amused and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder.</b> If they tell more fibs than their downright neighbours across the water, {{on the other}} hand they believe more; and I made myself in a single week such a reputation in Dublin as would take a man ten years and a mint of money to acquire in London. I had won five hundred thousand pounds at play; I was the favourite of the Empress Catherine of Russia; the confidential agent of Frederick of Prussia; it was I won the battle of Hochkirchen; I was the cousin of Madame Du Barry, the French King's favourite, and a thousand things beside. Indeed, to tell the truth, I hinted a number of these stories to my kind friends Ballyragget and Gawler; and they were not slow to improve the hints I gave them.|$|E
60|$|When we had {{finished}} eating, slaves appeared bearing a wooden framework from which hung a great pair of scales. Also there appeared {{officers of the}} King's Treasury, carrying leather bags which they opened, breaking the seals {{to show that the}} contents were pure gold coin. They set a number of these bags on one of the scales, and then ordered Bes to seat himself in the other. So much heavier did he prove than they expected him to be, that they were obliged to send back to the Treasury to fetch more bags of gold, for although Bes was so short in height, his weight was that of a large man. One of the treasurers grumbled, saying he should have been weighed before he had eaten and drunk. But the officer to whom he spoke grinned and answered that it mattered little, since the King was heir to criminals and that these bags would soon return to the Treasury, only they would need washing first, a remark that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sure enough he {{had shot}} {{straight}} this time. The buck lay motionless under a pine, with one point of his antlers imbedded deep in the ground. A sleek, gray, graceful deer he {{was just beginning to}} get his winter coat. His color was indeed a bluish gray. Haught hung him up to a branch, spread his hind legs, and cut him down the middle. The hunter's dexterity with a knife <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> how many deer he had dressed in his life in the open. We lifted the deer upon the saddle of Haught's horse and securely tied it there with a lasso; then with the hunter on foot, leading the way, we rode through the forest up the main ridge between Beaver and Turkey Canyons. Toward the rim I found the pines and spruces larger, and the thickets of aspen denser. We passed the heads of many ravines running down to the canyons on either side, and these were blazing gold and red in color, and so thick I could not see a rod into them. About {{the middle of the afternoon}} we reached camp. With venison hanging up to cool we felt somewhat like real hunters. R.C. had gone off to look for turkeys, which enterprise had been unsuccessful.|$|E
