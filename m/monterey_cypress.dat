500|$|The conifer plantings and oak avenues along Main and Lower Drives {{were well}} {{established}} {{and of a}} mature size by the 1940s. Conifers were widely planted from the 1860s along with Moreton Bay figs and occasionally oaks. Oaks and elms were more widely planted from the 1880s. It is not known if Linaker {{was responsible for the}} oak avenues, but it appears that many of the conifers, Monterey pines, Canary Island pines, <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypress,</b> hoop pine, Bunya Bunya pines and Himalayan cedars, predate Linaker and the oaks and elms may have been planted soon after his appointment. The use of Bhutan cypress in the landscape is almost certainly due to Linaker as he favoured upright trees. It is possible that the two remnant <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypress</b> along Main Drive and a Monterey pine along Lower Drive are trees from an earlier planting scheme. [...] Several trees and plants on the grounds of Kew Asylum and Kew Cottages have been classified as of historical significance by the Victorian Heritage Council and the National Trust of Australia (Victoria), and have been protected during the property's redevelopment.|$|E
500|$|Lepiota castaneidisca is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Formally {{described}} in 1912, {{it was for a}} long time considered the same species as the similar Lepiota cristata until molecular analysis reported in 2001 demonstrated that it was genetically distinct. It is most common in coastal and northern California, and has also been recorded in Mexico. A saprobic species, it is usually found under redwood and <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypress.</b> Its fruit bodies (mushrooms) have white caps with an orange-red to orange-brown center that measure up to [...] wide. The cream-colored to light pink stems are up to [...] long by [...] thick, and have a ring. L.castaneidisca can be distinguished from other similar Lepiota species by differences in habitat, macroscopic, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Isocupressic acid, a labdane diterpenoid, is an {{abortifacient}} {{component of}} C. macrocarpa. Monoterpenes (α- and γ-terpinene and terpinolene) are constituents of the foliage volatile oil. The oil exact composition is : α-pinene (20.2%), sabinene (12.0%), p-cymene (7.0%) and terpinen-4-ol (29.6%). Unusual sesquiterpenes {{can be found}} in the foliage. Longiborneol (also known as juniperol or macrocarpol) can also be isolated from <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|William Hammond Hall's {{long-term}} plan {{to create}} a vast recreational park in San Francisco was first implemented in The Panhandle in 1870, which became part of Hall's experimental laboratory for finding suitable vegetation for reclaiming the dunes. After much trial and error, Hall found that by first planting barley - followed months later by sea bent grass mixed with yellow lupin - the sand dunes could be stabilized enough to dump manure and top-soil without risk of wind-erosion. On top of this layer, <b>Monterey</b> Pines, <b>Monterey</b> <b>Cypresses</b> and Eucalyptus—all known for quick growth and shallow root structures—could take root.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the park's {{development}} centered on planting trees in order to stabilize the dunes that covered three-quarters of the park’s area. By 1875, about 60,000 trees, mostly Eucalyptus globulus, Monterey pine, and <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypress,</b> had been planted. By 1879, that figure more than doubled to 155,000 trees over [...] Later, McLaren scoured the world for trees, by correspondence. When he refused to retire at age 60, as was customary, the San Francisco city government was bombarded with letters: when he reached 70, a charter amendment was passed to exempt him from forced retirement.

6000|$|To {{visit the}} woods {{while they are}} languidly burning is a strange piece of experience. The fire passes through the {{underbrush}} at a run. Every {{here and there a}} tree flares up instantaneously from root to summit, scattering tufts of flame, and is quenched, it seems, as quickly. But this last is only in semblance. For after this first squib-like conflagration of the dry moss and twigs, there remains behind a deep-rooted and consuming fire in the very entrails of the tree. The resin of the pitch-pine is principally condensed {{at the base of the}} bole and in the spreading roots. [...] Thus, after the light, showy, skirmishing flames, which are only as the match to the explosion, have already scampered down the wind into the distance, the true harm is but beginning for this giant of the woods. You may approach the tree from one side, and see it scorched indeed from top to bottom, but apparently survivor of the peril. Make the circuit, and there, on the other side of the column, is a clear mass of living coal, spreading like an ulcer; while underground, to their most extended fibre, the roots are being eaten out by fire, and the smoke is rising through the fissures to the surface. A little while, and, without a nod of warning, the huge pine-tree snaps off short across the ground and falls prostrate with a crash. Meanwhile the fire continues its silent business; the roots are reduced to a fine ash; and long afterwards, if you pass by, you will find the earth pierced with radiating galleries, and preserving the design of all these subterranean spurs, as though it were the mould for a new tree instead of the print of an old one. These pitch-pines of Monterey are, with the single exception of the <b>Monterey</b> <b>cypress,</b> the most fantastic of forest trees. No words can give an idea of the contortion of their growth; they might figure without change in a circle of the nether hell as Dante pictured it; and at the rate at which trees grow, and at which forest fires spring up and gallop through the hills of California, we may look forward to a time when there will not be one of them left standing in that land of their nativity. At least they have not so much to fear from the axe, but perish by what may be called a natural although a violent death; while it is man in his short-sighted greed that robs the country of the nobler redwood. Yet a little while and perhaps all the hills of seaboard California may be as bald as Tamalpais.|$|E
