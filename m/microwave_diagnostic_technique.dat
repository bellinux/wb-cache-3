40|$|The {{electron}} spin dependence of reactions involving helium metastable atoms is investigated using optical pumping and <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques.</b> Wigner (1927) proposed that {{electron spin}} angular momentum is conserved in atomic collisions. This rule of elec-tron spin conservation is {{tested in the}} collision of two helium triplet metastable atoms in the afterglow of a helium discharge at 2 Torr: If the Wigner spin rule holds, the above reaction will be dependent upon the spin states of the colliding metastable atoms. A simple theory is developed showing the influence of spin conservation {{on the number of}} electrons produced in such reactions. The effect of electrons resulting from other collisions in the afterglow is introduced, and the two treatments are combined to yield a quantitative prediction of the results of experimental observation. Optical pumping is used to change the normal distribution of the spin states. <b>Microwave</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> are used to observe any corresponding change in the number of electrons in the helium afterglow. A very definite and measurable change in electron number density results, indicating that the Wigner spin rule holds in the collision of helium triplet metastable atoms. The experimental data lie within 20 % of the theoretical predictions in the early afterglow period, with the agreement decreasing at later times. [see PDF for formulas...|$|R

Additionally, neutral beam penetration in tokamak reactors will only be limited to the plasma edge. As a result, several optical, beam-based and magnetic diagnostics of today's plasmas might not be applicable to tomorrow's reactors, but the present discussion suggests that reactors could largely rely on <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> including <b>techniques</b> based on mode conversions and Collective Thomson Scattering.

40|$|Doppler {{backscattering}} (DBS) in 1 D is {{an established}} and powerful fusion plasma <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique.</b> In this thesis we explore {{the capability of}} the novel Synthetic Aperture <b>Microwave</b> Imaging <b>diagnostic</b> (SAMI) in performing proof-of-principle 2 D DBS experiments on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) and the National Spherical Torus eXperiment Upgrade (NSTX-U). Phenomena observed previously using 1 D DBS systems such as intrinsic plasma spin up, momentum injection from neutral beams and sharp changes in power and turbulence velocity coinciding with the L-H transition are re-observed. In addition, SAMI’s unique 2 D DBS capability has enabled the first ever 2 D maps of Doppler backscattered radiation to be constructed. These 2 D maps reveal that, due to turbulence elongated along field lines, Doppler backscattered power is concentrated in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. This distribution of backscattered power allows magnetic pitch angle to be measured. Results from the utilisation of this technique are presented using MAST and NSTX-U data. This procedure constitutes a new independent channel for diagnosing magnetic pitch angle and is the first case of pitch angle being measured using a <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostic.</b> A method utilising <b>microwave</b> <b>diagnostics</b> {{is of particular interest}} as this presents the possibility of high temporal and spatial magnetic pitch measurements enabling, through application of Amp`ere’s law, measurement of edge current density: an important parameter in governing pedestal stability. The new capabilities and limitations resulting from implementation of a 2 D DBS phased array system are discussed. How such a 2 D device might be further optimised is examined and areas of further study are proposed...|$|R
