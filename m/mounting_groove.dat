40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is {{to assist in the}} {{development}} of a low cost nanopositioner by designing a specific component - a shim that is located in the scan tip assembly of the nanopositioner. Nanopositioners must maximize precision to successfully produce features of fewer than 100 nm. The kinematic coupling used to place the tool tip is capable of producing a high level of precision across tool changes, assuming the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> is held in place. It is therefore very important to secure the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> to prevent dislocation and enhance the viability of nano-scale device fabrication. The shim developed within this thesis serves to secure the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> of the kinematic coupling, which was previously held in place solely with magnetic attraction. The shim secures the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> by applying a force to the side of the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> in addition to increasing the magnetic attraction between the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> and universal mount of the nanopositioner. It was first modeled with solid and magnetic modeling software before being manufactured and tested. With the addition of the shim, the vertical force required to displace the <b>groove</b> <b>mount</b> increased by a factor of 9. 4, from 0. 14 N to 1. 29 N. Similarly the lateral force increased by a factor of 27. 9, from 0. 09 N to 2. 45 N. As a result, the nanopositioner is significantly better suited to perform its function. The nanopositioner will be used to produce nano-scale devices including carbon nanotubes, molecular actuators, and transistors, with applications across several disciplines. Future work includes developing a tool to bend the shim tabs and simplify the manufacturing process. by Corey G. Harris. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|In this thesis, a numerically {{efficient}} three-dimensional {{finite element}} scheme {{is used to}} analyze arbitrarily-shaped discontinuities in inhomogeneous-dielectric-loaded waveguides. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} discontinuity problems in finlines and related structures. A simple but accurate recursive algorithm, the boundary-marching method, for modeling uniform waveguides of arbitrarily-shaped cross-section is developed for the analysis. This algorithm is used to generate the matrix representations of various waveguides, including the unilateral finlines. It is shown that, by using the substructure formulation and the matrix representation of the uniform guide, the finite element mesh of the discontinuity problem can be truncated to a proximity very close to the discontinuity without compromising with the result accuracy. Finally, characteristics of inductive strips in unilateral finline are evaluated using the finite element scheme. The scattering parameters of the inductive strips obtained with the finite element method agree with published measurements and other numerical solutions to within a few percent with {{a relatively small number of}} elements. Various effects of the manufacturing process, such as the effect of <b>mounting</b> <b>grooves,</b> finite metalization thickness and deflection of dielectric substrate, on the discontinuity parameters are studied in detail using the finite element scheme...|$|R

40|$|New and {{efficient}} numerical modeling concepts and procedures based on Transmission Line Matrix and Finite Element {{methods have been}} developed for the analysis of generalized microwave and millimeter-wave structures. An algorithm, based on a vectorial Finite Element approach, has been developed to determine the dispersion characteristics, field distributions, pseudo-impedances and, losses of shielded transmission media of arbitrary cross-section. The structures analysed with this algorithm include dielectrically loaded ridged waveguides, bilateral finlines in rectangular and circular waveguide enclosures and ridged finlines. The major contributions to the literature are the estimation of losses of bilateral finlines in rectangular waveguide enclosures, the effect of substrate bending and <b>mounting</b> <b>grooves</b> on the dispersion characteristics, the study of finlines in circular waveguide enclosures, and, the analysis of a new modified finline structure called "Ridged Finline". New algorithms to apply the principles of Diakoptics to the TLM method for field partitioning in large structures have been developed. Diakoptics leads to considerable reduction in memory and CPU requirements for large structures since it allows numerical preprocessing of parts of a large electromagnetic structure which remain unchanged during an analysis and optimization procedure. A space interpolation technique based on the transverse field distribution of the propagation mode has been proposed for efficient field partitioning in single-mode structures. Frequency dispersive boundaries are represented in the time domain by their characteristic impulse response or numerical/discrete Green's function. This discrete Green's function has been named the "Johns matrix" in honour of the late P. B. Johns, pioneer of TLM and time domain Diakoptics. The parasitic reflections from the absorbing boundaries in 3 -D structures, due to the finite space and time discretization have been reduced to less than one percent by exponentially tapering the impulse response, or Johns Matrix, of frequency dispersive boundaries. This allows wideband S [...] parameter extraction of waveguide discontinuities and components from a single impulsive TLM simulation.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the coefficient of performance of domestic heat pumps has been stagnating since the introduction of scroll compressors in the early nineties. Compact oil-free direct driven radial compressors represent a promising alternative to {{the current state of}} the art refrigeration compressors. The operation characteristics of dynamic compressors naturally fits the heat pump load and the absence of oil allows the full deployment of the potential of enhanced surface evaporators and the implementation of advanced multi-stage cycles both proven means to increase the heat pump performance. This article presents the experimental investigation of a hermetic single-stage and direct-driven radial compressor supported on gas-lubricated bearings designed for domestic heat pump applications.

30|$|All cores were <b>mounted</b> on <b>grooved</b> boards with {{glue and}} sanded using {{progressively}} finer sand papers. The first sanding {{was applied to}} flatten the cores, whereas the subsequent sanding episodes polished the cores for better visualization of the cross-sectional area (Speer 2012). The annual tree-ring widths of the cores were measured using a Lintab digital positioning table with a resolution of 1 / 100  mm (Rinn 2005). For cross-dating of the time-series, the software package TSAP-Win (Rinn 2003) was used and hereby checked for possible missing growth rings or measurement errors. Further analyses were carried out in R (R Core Team 2018) using package dplR (Bunn et al. 2015). With dplR, all tree-ring series were indexed using a double detrending process: first, modified negative exponential curves were applied followed by cubic smoothing splines (20  years rigidity, 50 % wavelength cutoff). The detrending was conducted to remove low frequency trends, which are age associated (Holmes et al. 1986; Gillner et al. 2014). The resulting detrended series were averaged using Tukey’s biweight robust mean to build a final chronology and chronologies for each category (all trees; urban, suburban, rural; center, north, east, west). As a result of detrending, standardized chronologies with a yearly ring width index (RWI) averaging around 1 were obtained. Values smaller than 1 indicate growth below normal, while values greater than 1 indicate growth higher than normal. For chronology building, the autocorrelation of every individual series was removed (maximum order: 3). This procedure of detrending ensured a removal of all long-term growth trends, thereby obtaining a chronology containing only tree ring variability with climate fluctuations (Cook and Holmes 1986; Gillner et al. 2013). The statistical validity of the chronologies was assessed using the expressed population signal (EPS) for the common period of the time series of all analyzed tree individuals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Currently, {{straight}} cutting-edge carpenter shapers {{are widely}} used in the production process. The manner of contact between this traditional type of shaper and the workpiece is a piecewise continuous curve. One drawback of shapers of this type is that the noise generated during the cutting process tends to be very loud. In order to overcome this problem, the current paper takes {{the thickness of the}} cutter into account and employs the concept of equidistant lines and surfaces to develop a new carpenter shaper that comprises a helical cutting edge on a cylindrical shank surface. The geometric shape of the blade surface that is <b>mounted</b> in the <b>groove</b> of the cutter shank is ®rst derived. The contact curve of the proposed carpenter shaper with the workpiece is shown to be continuous. In order to establish a geometric model that facilitates the simple production of a carpenter helical shaping cutter, this paper presents a new design approach, which constructs an equidistant and equivalent involute helical surface model and a corresponding planar unwinding torus model. The carpenter shaper thus obtained is proven to be successful in reducing the noise levels of the cutting process. The contact style of the shaper also oVers the additional advantages of higher cutting e¤ciency, lower energy consumption and longer tool-life. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the eVectiveness of the proposed modelling approach. The results indicate that the proposed carpenter helical shaping (CHS) cutter model is accurate, e¤cient and comprehensive. The model is su¤ciently accurate that it {{can be used as a}} guideline for the design, manufacture and assembly of robust, reliable and silent wooden shapers...|$|R

The proposed «MM Stahl 1018 » due to its composition and consistency makes it possible to ensure high accuracy contact of the supporting surface and the frames of the foundation, protecting the frames against corrosion as well.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{retrofitting}} methods {{are used to}} upgrade existing structures. For example, steel plates and Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) jackets are externally bonded to members to increase their capacity in flexure and shear. However, due {{to the issue of}} corrosion these strengthening systems may lose their efficiency with time. FRP materials have been used to strengthen many structural components of different shapes and types. FRP jackets, FRP Strips, and FRP rods have commonly been used to rehabilitate existing structural components. The many advantages of using FRP as strengthening materials have made this material an attractive alternative: advantages such as lightweight, high strength, and ease of setting up. Among the many applications using FRP, Near Surface Mounted [...] Fiber Reinforced polymer (NSM-FRP) is a promising technique used to strengthen concrete members. However, de-bonding issues have to be overcome to make this technique efficient and reliable. The NSM-FRP technique consists of making a groove along the surface of the concrete member to be retrofitted with depth less than the cover of the member. After cleaning the groove, epoxy paste is used to fill two-thirds of the groove 2 ̆ 7 s depth. The FRP element is then <b>mounted</b> in the <b>groove.</b> Finally, the groove is filled with epoxy and the excessive epoxy is leveled with surface of the concrete. This technique makes the FRP material completely covered by epoxy in the cover of the concrete. This method can be used for strengthening both the positive and negative moment regions of girders and slabs. Groove size, paste, concrete, and rods properties are the main variables that control the efficiency of the NSM-FRP rods. The main objective of this research project is to determine the behavior of reinforced concrete beams that are strengthened with NSM-CFRP reinforcement bars. In this research project, the bond characteristics of NSM-CFRP reinforcement bars are first determined from pullout tests.

40|$|The design {{allows for}} the low-stress {{mounting}} of fragile objects, like thin walled glass, by using particular ways of compensating, isolating, or releasing the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) differences between the mounted object and the mount itself. This mount profile is lower than true full kinematic mounting. Also, this approach enables accurate positioning of the component for electrical and optical interfaces. It avoids the higher and unpredictable stress issues that often result from potting the object. The mount has been built and tested to space-flight specifications, and has been used for fiber-optic, optical, and electrical interfaces for a spaceflight mission. This mount design is often metal and is slightly larger than the object to be mounted. The objects are optical or optical/electrical, and optical and/or electrical interfaces are required from the top and bottom. This requires the mount to be open at both ends, and for the object s position to be controlled. Thin inside inserts at the top and bottom contact the housing at defined lips, or edges, and hold the fragile object in the mount. The inserts can be customized to mimic the outer surface of the object, which further reduces stress. The inserts have the opposite CTE of the housing material, partially compensating for the CTE difference that causes thermal stress. A spring washer is inserted at one end to compensate for more CTE difference and to hold the object against the location edge of the mount for any optical position requirements. The spring also ensures that any fiber-optic or optic interface, which often requires some pressure to ensure a good interface, does not overstress the fragile object. The insert thickness, material, and spring washer size can be traded against each other to optimize the mount and stresses for various thermal and vibration load ranges and other mounting requirements. The alternate design uses two separate, unique features to reduce stress and hold the object. A release agent is applied to the inside surface of the mount just before the binding potting material is injected in the mount. This prevents the potting material from bonding to the mount, and thus prevents stress from being applied, at very low temperatures, to the fragile object being mounted. The potting material mixing and curing is temperature- and humidity-controlled. The <b>mount</b> has radial <b>grooves</b> cut in it that the potting material fills, thus controlling the vertical position of the mounted object. The design can easily be used for long and thin objects, short and wide objects, and any shape in between. The design s advantages are amplified for long and thin fragile objects. The general testing range was 45 to + 45 C, but multiple mounts were successfully tested down to 60 and up to 50 C and the design can be adjusted for larger ranges...|$|R
