5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} <b>model</b> <b>with</b> rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a <b>model</b> <b>with</b> long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's <b>model</b> <b>with</b> the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the general}} {{description}} for Z'-Z-γ mixing as derived from the electroweak chiral Lagrangian, we characterize and classify the various new physics models involving the Z' boson that {{have appeared in the}} literature into five classes: 1. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> minimal Z'-Z mass mixing; 2. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> minimal Z'-Z kinetic mixing; 3. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> general Z'-Z mixing; 4. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> Z'-γ kinetic and Z'-Z mixing; and 5. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> Stueckelberg-type mixing. The corresponding mixing matrices are explicitly evaluated for each of these classes. We constrain and classify the Z' boson charges with respect to quark-leptons by anomaly cancellation conditions.

In this paper we present {{a new approach to}} object-oriented <b>modelling</b> <b>with</b> words based on a new theory of inheritance where object memberships and property applicabilities are uncertain.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{important}} debate about the relative merits of <b>models</b> <b>with</b> discrete and continuous representations of consumer heterogeneity. A recent JMR study (Andrews, Ansari, and Currim 2002, AAC hereafter) compared metric conjoint analysis <b>models</b> <b>with</b> discrete and continuous representations of heterogeneity, finding no differences between the two <b>models</b> <b>with</b> respect to parameter recovery and prediction of ratings for holdout profiles. <b>Models</b> <b>with</b> continuous representations of heterogeneity did fit the data better than <b>models</b> <b>with</b> discrete representations of heterogeneity. The goal of the current study is to compare the relative performance of logit choice <b>models</b> <b>with</b> discrete vs. continuous representations of heterogeneity in terms of the accuracy of household-level parameters, fit, and forecasting accuracy. To accomplish this goal, we conduct an extensive simulation experiment <b>with</b> logit <b>models</b> in a scanner data context, using an experimental design based on AAC and other recent simulation studies. One of the main findings is that <b>models</b> <b>with</b> continuous and discrete representations of heterogeneity recover household-level parameter estimates and predict holdout choices about equally well except when the number of purchases per household is small, in which case the <b>models</b> <b>with</b> continuous representations perform very poorly...|$|R
