40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White <b>matter</b> hyperintensities of presumed {{vascular}} {{origin in}} elderly patients with hypertension {{may be part}} of a general cerebral perfusion deficit, involving not only the white <b>matter</b> hyperintensities but also the surrounding normal-appearing white <b>matter</b> and gray <b>matter.</b> We aimed to study the relation between white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume and CBF and assess whether white <b>matter</b> hyperintensities are related to a general perfusion deficit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 185 participants of the Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care trial between 72 and 80 years of age with systolic hypertension, white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume and CBF were derived from 3 D FLAIR and arterial spin-labeling MR imaging, respectively. We compared white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity CBF, normal-appearing white <b>matter</b> CBF, and GM CBF across quartiles of white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume and assessed the continuous relation between these CBF estimates and white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume by using linear regression. RESULTS: Mean white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity CBF was markedly lower in higher quartiles of white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume, and white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume and white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity CBF were negatively related (standardized = - 0. 248, P =. 001) in linear regression. We found no difference in normal-appearing white <b>matter</b> or GM CBF across quartiles of white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume or any relation between white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume and normal-appearing white <b>matter</b> CBF (standardized = - 0. 065, P =. 643) or GM CBF (standardized = - 0. 035, P =. 382) in linear regression. CONCLUSIONS: Higher white <b>matter</b> hyperintensity volume in elderly individuals with hypertension was associated with lower perfusion within white <b>matter</b> hyperintensities, but not with lower perfusion in the surrounding normal-appearing white <b>matter</b> or GM. These findings suggest that white <b>matter</b> hyperintensities in elderly individuals with hypertension relate to local microvascular alterations rather than a general cerebral perfusion defici...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the QCD, the hadronic <b>matter</b> {{can have}} various phases with <b>matter</b> density and temper-ature. In general, {{when there is}} phase {{transition}} in a <b>matter,</b> {{it is known that}} a symmetry in the <b>matter</b> changes. In case of the hadronic <b>matter,</b> the chiral symmetry in the <b>matter</b> is expected to be restored when the <b>matter</b> density (or temperature) increases. The actual order parameter with respect to the chiral symmetry in the hadronic <b>matter</b> is known as the quark condensate from the QCD, but the pion decay constant, corresponding to the radius of the chiral circle, plays the role of the order parameter in an effective field theoretical approach to the QCD. In this paper, by using the skyrmion model which is an effective theory to the QCD, we construct the skyrmion <b>matter</b> as a model of the hadronic <b>matter</b> (nuclear <b>matter)</b> and calculate the pion decay constant in the <b>matter.</b> Because of presence of the <b>matter,</b> the pion decay constant is split into the two components, the temporal component and the spatial component.
