The analysis shows a Northern Hemisphere (NH) upper tropospheric jet stretching nearly zonally from the mid-Atlantic across Africa and Asia. In winter–spring, this jet splits over the eastern Pacific, merges again over eastern North America, and then shifts poleward over the North Atlantic. The jets associated with tropical circulations are also captured, with upper tropospheric westerlies demarking cyclonic flow downstream from the Australian and Asian monsoon anticyclones and associated easterly jets. <b>Multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> {{associated with the}} thermal tropopause “break” commonly extend poleward from the subtropical upper tropospheric jet. In Southern Hemisphere (SH) summer, the tropopause break, along with a poleward-stretching secondary tropopause, often occurs across the tropical westerly jet downstream of the Australian monsoon region.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{present a}} {{comparison}} of lidar observations of midlatitude cirrus clouds over the SIRTA observatory between 2002 and 2006 with <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> (MT) retrieved from radiosounding temperature profiles. The temporal variability of MT properties (frequency, thickness) are discussed. Results show a marked annual cycle, with MT frequency reaching its lowest point in May (~ 18 % occurrence of MT) and slowly rising to more than 40 % in DJF. The average thickness of the MT also follows an annual cycle, going from less than 1 km in spring to 1. 5 km in late autumn. Comparison with lidar observations show that cirrus clouds show a preference for being located close below the 1 st tropopause. When the cloud top is above the 1 st tropopause (7 % of observations), in 20 % of cases the cloud base is above it as well, resulting in a cirrus cloud "sandwiched" between the two tropopauses. Compared to the general distribution of cirrus, cross-tropopause cirrus show a higher frequency of large optical depths, while inter-tropopause cirrus show almost exclusively low optical depths (τ < 0. 03 in 90 % of cases) typical of subvisible clouds.

40|$|Abstract: Cirrus clouds {{have been}} {{identified}} by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2001) {{as one of the}} priority areas for research due to their radiative and dynamic influence on the Earth’s climate. Since cirrus clouds are located at high altitudes, their formation mechanism and evolution are sensitive to atmospheric conditions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Therefore, studying UTLS conditions could give important hints on what drives cirrus cloud formation and how to better predict their properties. The tropopause temperature inversion has a constraining effect on cloud altitude, and several studies have focused on the properties of cirrus clouds near the tropopause, but especially at tropical latitudes. Hence variability in the thermodynamic structure of the tropopause could affect the properties of cirrus clouds near the UTLS transition. <b>Multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> are symptoms of actual physical phenomena that can help detect and analyze specific atmospheric conditions of cloud formation. This study focuses on the relationship between the tropopause(s) and cirrus clouds, thus only clouds whose top altitudes are located higher than 7 km will be considered. The aim of the work is to study the possible relationship between MT at midlatitudes and ice clouds considering collocated in situ and remote-sensing observations made between 2002 and 2003. Tropopause levels were retrieved from temperature profiles obtained through a data set of radiosoundings (launched at 00 and/or 12 UT) from the Argentine Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN). Lidar observations are provided by the elastic backscatter lidar located in Villa Martelli near Buenos Aires and is based on Nd: YAG laser transmitter which delivers around 300 mJ by pulse at 532 nm with a 10 Hz pulse rate, 5 ns pulse duration, with a tilt angle less than 0. 6 mrad. The lapse-rate tropopause definition is based on the variability in lapse rate in an atmospheric temperature profile. This technical definition, which is used {{in the rest of the}} present study actually reflects dynamical disturbances to the temperature profile resulting in multiple temperature inversions in the UTLS that can lead to tropopause foldings and mixing of stratospheric and tropospheric air. Analysis of temperature profiles from the Buenos Aires radiosoundings (34. 6 ºS, 58. 5 ºW)  shows that <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> occur in almost 50 % of cases, with a third tropopause near 6 % of cases (additional tropopauses were considered to be negligible). Cloud with tops above the first tropopause occur in more than 30 % of the observations, out of which a strong 50 % happen in a multitropopause situation. These related clouds occupy a limited region between the first and second tropopauses, with their top in the lower of the intertropopause zone. Almost no cirrus cloud was detected with a top altitude above the second tropopause. Therefore it appears that clouds that cross the lowest tropopause live in an unstable temperature profile, which leads a large fraction of them to rise or expand vertically until they reach the next tropopause...|$|R

It has been found that profiles of the mean temperature and altitude show little differences between the complete and incomplete datasets. Moreover, no statistical significant differences were found for the mean values of the variables for the complete and incomplete datasets. The most probable reason for those results is that the cause of the missing reports has a random behaviour.

40|$|The {{representation}} of upper tropospheric–lower stratospheric (UTLS) jet and tropopause characteristics is compared in five modern high-resolution reanalyses for 1980 through 2014. Climatologies of upper tropospheric jet, subvortex jet (the lowermost {{part of the}} stratospheric vortex), and <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopause</b> frequency distributions in MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications), ERA-I (ERA-Interim; the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF, interim reanalysis), JRA- 55 (the Japanese 55 -year Reanalysis), and CFSR (the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) are compared with those in MERRA- 2. Differences between alternate products from individual reanalysis systems are assessed; in particular, a comparison of CFSR data on model and pressure levels {{highlights the importance of}} vertical grid spacing. Most of the differences in distributions of UTLS jets and multiple tropopauses are consistent with the differences in assimilation model grids and resolution – for example, ERA-I (with coarsest native horizontal resolution) typically shows a significant low bias in upper tropospheric jets with respect to MERRA- 2, and JRA- 55 (the Japanese 55 -year Reanalysis) a more modest one, while CFSR (with finest native horizontal resolution) shows a high bias with respect to MERRA- 2 in both upper tropospheric jets and multiple tropopauses. Vertical temperature structure and grid spacing are especially important for <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopause</b> characterizations. Substantial differences between MERRA and MERRA- 2 are seen in mid- to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter upper tropospheric jets and multiple tropopauses {{as well as in the}} upper tropospheric jets associated with tropical circulations during the solstice seasons; some of the largest differences from the other reanalyses are seen in the same times and places. Very good qualitative agreement among the reanalyses is seen between the large-scale climatological features in UTLS jet and <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopause</b> distributions.

The dynamical mechanism of MT events was examined by {{observations of the}} first mesosphere–stratosphere–troposphere (MST) radar in the Antarctic, the Program of the Antarctic Syowa MST/Incoherent Scatter (IS) Radar (PANSY), and of radiosondes on 8 – 11 April 2013. The MT structure above the first tropopause is composed of strong temperature fluctuations. By {{a detailed analysis of}} observed three-dimensional wind and temperature fluctuation components, it is shown that the phase and amplitude relations between these components are consistent with the theoretical characteristics of linear inertia–gravity waves (IGWs). Numerical simulations were performed by using a nonhydrostatic model. The simulatedMT structures and IGWparameters agreewell with the observation. In the analysis using the numerical simulation data, it is seen that IGWs were generated around 658 S, 158 E and around 708 S, 158 E, propagated eastward, and reached the region above Syowa Station when the MT event was observed. These IGWs were likely radiated spontane-ously from the upper-tropospheric flow around 658 S, 158 E and were forced by strong southerly surface winds over steep topography (708 S, 158 E). The MT occurrence is attributable to strong IGWs and the low mean static stability in the polar winter lower stratosphere. It is also shown that nonorographic gravity waves associatedwith the tropopause folding event contribute to 40 % of the momentum fluxes, as shown by a gravity wave–resolving general circulation model in the lower stratosphere around 658 S. This result indicates that they are one of the key components for solving the cold-bias problem found in most climate models. 1...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of the {{lapse rate}} {{tropopause}} are analyzed globally for tropopause altitude and temperature using {{global positioning system}} (GPS) radio occultation (RO) data from late 2001 {{to the end of}} 2013. RO profiles feature high vertical resolution and excellent quality in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, which are key factors for <b>tropopause</b> determination, including <b>multiple</b> ones. RO data provide measurements globally and allow examination of both temporal and spatial tropopause characteristics based entirely on observational measurements. To investigate latitudinal and longitudinal tropopause characteristics, the mean annual cycle, and inter-annual variability, we use tropopauses from individual profiles as well as their statistical measures for zonal bands and 5 ° × 10 ° bins. The latitudinal structure of first tropopauses shows the well-known distribution with high (cold) tropical tropopauses and low (warm) extra-tropical tropopauses. In the transition zones (20 to 40 ° N/S), individual profiles reveal varying tropopause altitudes from less than 7 km to more than 17 km due to variability in the subtropical tropopause break. In this region, we also find <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> throughout the year. Longitudinal variability is strongest at northern hemispheric mid latitudes and in the Asian monsoon region. The mean annual cycle features changes in amplitude and phase, depending on latitude. This is caused by different underlying physical processes (such as the Brewer–Dobson circulation – BDC) and atmospheric dynamics (such as the strong polar vortex in the southern hemispheric winter). Inter-annual anomalies of tropopause parameters show signatures of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the quasi–biennial oscillation (QBO), and the varying strength of the polar vortex, including sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{classifying}} the upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UTLS) jets {{has been developed}} that allows satellite and aircraft trace gas data and meteorological fields to be efficiently mapped in a jet coordinate view. A detailed characterization of <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> accompanies the jet characterization. Jet climatologies show the well-known high altitude subtropical and lower altitude polar jets in the upper troposphere, {{as well as a}} pattern of concentric polar and subtropical jets in the Southern Hemisphere, and shifts of the primary jet to high latitudes associated with blocking ridges in Northern Hemisphere winter. The jet-coordinate view segregates air masses differently than the commonly-used equivalent latitude (EqL) coordinate throughout the lowermost stratosphere and in the upper troposphere. Mapping O 3 data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite and the Winter Storms aircraft datasets in jet coordinates thus emphasizes different aspects of the circulation compared to an EqL-coordinate framework: the jet coordinate reorders the data geometrically, thus highlighting the strong PV, tropopause height and trace gas gradients across the subtropical jet, whereas EqL is a dynamical coordinate that may blur these spatial relationships but provides information on irreversible transport. The jet coordinate view identifies the concentration of stratospheric ozone well below the tropopause in the region poleward of and below the jet core, as well as other transport features associated with the upper tropospheric jets. Using the jet information in EqL coordinates allows us to study trace gas distributions in regions of weak versus strong jets, and demonstrates weaker transport barriers in regions with less jet influence. MLS and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer trace gas fields for spring 2008 in jet coordinates show very strong, closely correlated, PV, tropopause height and trace gas gradients across the jet, and evidence of intrusions of stratospheric air below the tropopause below and poleward of the subtropical jet; these features are consistent between instruments and among multiple trace gases.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on climatologies for temperature structure and tropopause parameters in the tropics, based on radiosonde, satellites data and model reanalysis show good agreement between radiosonde (RS) and data derived from remote sounding, such as GPS Radio Occultation (GPS RO), and reanalysis. The agreement is remarkably good over and immediately near the tropics. However, {{in the southern}} extra tropical region, especially at medium and high latitudes, there are often considerable differences in the temperature profiles as latitudes increases, which depends on the variability of location and evolution of the tropopause. The purpose of this work is to compare the behaviour of temperature profiles derived from GPS RO, daily and monthly ERA 40 reanalysis means and nearby radiosonde measurements in the southern extra tropical region. Argentina serves {{as an example of}} latitudes between 30 °- 60 °S.

The results show that in most cases are GPS RO more closely related to RS measurements than to reanalysis profiles, both for daily values, monthly means and their standard deviations. However, GPS RO deviations increase with respect to RS for heights above the tropopause, i. e., in the stratosphere, and decrease into the troposphere. Radiosonde and GPS appear to be in good agreement for tropopause temperatures and heights estimates when a single tropopause (LRT 1) is considered, but with decreasing agreement as latitudes increase. Furthermore, while single and double tropopause events can be detected in RS observations this is less common for the GPS RO retrievals...|$|E

This paper reports new findings on the structure of upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) layer, and provides evidence for stratosphere and troposphere exchange (STE) over the TP. Due to sparseness of high resolution sonde data, many previous studies assumed that there was only one thermal tropopause over the TP. Actually the radiosonde temperature profiles at pre-onset time of the Asian monsoon over the TP often exhibit a <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopause</b> (MT). The MT occurs in winter time with much higher frequency than any previous estimations over the Plateau. The MT during this time period is associated with tropopause folding near the subtropical westerly jet. The MT consistently varied with the movement of the jet. The MT becomes a single tropopause with the development of the monsoon. According to their height distribution, the MT can be divided into tropical and polar characterized tropopauses. Detailed analyses of MT characteristics are reported in this paper. Although some scientists have analyzed global MT events (with data including GPS radio occultation, ERA 40 data and Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive database), the frequency of their MT occurrences in winter season over the plateau is largely under-estimated. This significant difference must be caused by the coarse vertical resolution of these data. The stratospheric intruding episodes are generally associated with the presence of subtropical westerly jet stream over the Plateau. The subtropical jet causes dynamic tropopause foldings over the plateau, which have been observed by us as thermal MT events. Intrusions of high latitude stratospheric ozone rich air into the troposphere over the plateau give us a new explanation to why total column ozone in winter is higher than that in summer...|$|E

It is a large VHF monostatic pulse Doppler radar {{operating}} at 47 MHz, consisting of an active phased array of 1, 045 Yagi antennas and an equivalent number of transmit-receive (TR) modules with a total peak output power of 500 kW. The first stage of the radar was installed at Syowa Station (69 ° 00 ’S, 40 ° 35 ’E) in early 2011, and is currently operating with 228 antennas and modules. This paper reports the project’s scientific objectives, technical descriptions, and the preliminary results of observations made to date. The radar is designed to clarify the role of atmospheric gravity waves at high latitudes in the momentum budget of the global circulation in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, and to explore the dynamical aspects of unique polar phenomena such as polar mesospheric clouds (PMC) and polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). The katabatic winds as a branch of Antarctic tropospheric circulation and as {{an important source of}} gravity waves are also of special interest. Moreover, strong and sporadic energy inputs from the magnetosphere by energetic particles and field-aligned currents can be quantitatively assessed by the broad height coverage of the radar which extends from the lower troposphere to the upper ionosphere. From engineering points of view, the radar had to overcome restrictions related to the severe environments of Antarctic research, such as very strong winds, limited power availability, short construction periods, and limited manpower availability. We resolved these problems through the adoption of specially designed class-E amplifiers, lightweight and tough antenna elements, and versatile antenna arrangements. Although the radar is currently operating with only about a quarter of its full designed system components, we have already obtained interesting results on the Antarctic troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, such as gravity waves, <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopauses</b> associated with a severe snow storm in the troposphere and stratosphere, and polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE).

The stratospheric intruding episodes are generally associated with the presence of subtropical jet stream over the Plateau.

In the present study, high vertical resolution and high accuracy measurements from COSMIC Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements are used to investigate and quantify the effect of tropical cyclones that occurred over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the last decade on the tropical tropopause parameters. The tropopause parameters include cold-point tropopause altitude (CPH) and temperature (CPT), lapse-rate tropopause altitude (LRH) and temperature (LRT) and the thickness of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), that is defined as the layer between convective outflow level (COH) and CPH, obtained from GPS RO data. From all the TC events, we generate the mean cyclone-centred composite structure for the tropopause parameters and removed it from the climatological mean obtained from averaging the GPS RO data from 2002 to 2013. Since the TCs include eye, eye walls and deep convective bands, we obtained the tropopause parameters based on radial distance from the cyclone eye. In general, decrease in the CPH in the eye is noticed as expected. However, as the distance from the cyclone eye increases by 300, 400, and 500 km, an enhancement in CPH (CPT) and LRH (LRT) is observed. Lowering of CPH (0. 6 km) and LRH (0. 4 km) values with coldest CPT and LRT (2 – 3 K) within a 500 km radius of the TC centre is noticed. Higher (2 km) COH leading to the lowering of TTL thickness (2 – 3 km) is clearly observed. There are <b>multiple</b> <b>tropopause</b> structures in the profiles of temperature obtained within 100 km from the centre of the TC.
