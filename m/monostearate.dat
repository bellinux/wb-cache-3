40|$|Lubricating oil {{additives}} based on boron compounds are promising materials for lubrication {{due to their}} tribological advantages such as antiwear efficiency, good film strength, and high temperature resistance. This article deals with the preparation of zinc borate particles that are well dispersed and colloidally stabilized in mineral oil. This method starts with preparing two inverse emulsions (water-in-oil) with sorbitan <b>monostearate</b> (Span 60) as a surfactant, light neutral oil as a continuous phase, and the aqueous solutions of borax decahydrate (Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10 H 2 O) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O) as the dispersed phases. The produced particles were zinc borate crystals having both rod-like and spherical morphologies, and the diameters of spherical particles were changing between 20 and 30 nm. FTIR spectra of the obtained particles showed the characteristic peaks of trihedral borate (B(3) -O) and tetrahedral borate (B(4) -O) {{groups as well as}} the specific peaks of the sorbitan <b>monostearate.</b> TG showed 30. 42 % and 22. 08 % mass loss at 600 °C for the samples prepared by inverse emulsion and precipitation techniques, respectively. The endothermic peak at 50 °C is observed due to the melting of sorbitan <b>monostearate</b> and the heat of melting is evaluated as - 3. 50 J/g. Tribological studies revealed that sorbitan <b>monostearate</b> not only outperformed as a dispersing agent of inorganic particles, but also it proved to be an anti-wear agent. Zinc borate produced by precipitation decreased the wear scar diameter from 1. 402 to 0. 639 mm and the friction coefficient from 0. 099 to 0. 064. The inverse emulsion was effective in decreasing wear scar diameter and the friction coefficient by lowering them to 0. 596 and 0. 089 mm, respectively.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} and the rheological {{parameters of}} Mexican Manchego cheese-like products whose fat fraction {{was made up}} by canola oil and different combination of emulsifiers were studied. Nine Mexican Manchego cheese-like products (MCLP) were made from canola oil-skim milk emulsions prepared using different blends of lipophilic and hydrophilic emulsifiers (polyoxyethylene sorbitan <b>monostearate</b> (P), sorbitan <b>monostearate</b> (S) and glycerol <b>monostearate</b> (G)). A control Mexican Manchego cheese (MCFF) was prepared from whole milk.

Values of G ’ and G ” of the MCFF cheese were the highest {{compared with those of}} the MCLP cheeses, but tan G values of the MCFF cheese were lowest than those exhibited by the MCLP cheeses over all the range of temperature studied. P contributed to obtain MCLP cheeses having small oil droplets immersed in a compact and dense protein network, which exhibited higher storage and loss modulus values. Predominance of S and G in the emulsifier blend resulted in MCLP cheeses having relatively larger and wider variation in oil droplets sizes, which were dispersed in a relaxed protein network.

40|$|Author abstract]In {{the present}} bread industry, open fresh bakery style is in {{frequent}} use, and {{the consumption of}} the products made of rich material is increasing, while the bread made of lean material is in over-production. Much difficulties in meeting diversified tastes {{and needs of the}} consumers, for example, are responsible for such situation. As an approach to the solution thereto, effect of the addition of glyceryl <b>monostearate,</b> a lipophilic surfactant, to frozen dough were examined {{in order to make it}} possible to obtain bread with the same quality as those made by the conventional method through all the manufacturing processes including packing and storage of the dough at - 20 °C except baking. The results revealed that little effect was obtained on the quality of the dough added with glyceryl <b>monostearate</b> of 0. 1 to 0. 5 % (to the weight of wheat flour). However, in the dough added with as high as 1. 0 to 3. 0 % of glyceryl <b>monostearate</b> : the frozen dough had stable storability and was sound enough even for a period of long as 20 days of storage, while the bread had inner surfaces with sufficient traces of C 0 _ 2 bubbles and a very good condition in spiral shape, resulting in bread of good quality. These good results are thought to be ascribable to the additive effect of glyceryl <b>monostearate</b> in the direction of inhibiting the absorptivity of gluten and preventing expansion, well hydrating moisture and gluten and elevating its water holding capacity by adjusting the moisture transfer, dispersing the additive fat in a monomolecular film along of the yeast and the starch in the dough. [著者抄録]現在,食パン業界ではオーブンフレッシュ・ベーカリー式が多用され,リッチな材料による菓子パン系製品の消費が増加し,リーンな材料による食パンは生産過剰傾向となっている. これらの原因としては消費者の嗜好やニーズの多様化に対応出来ず,同時に経営面においても利益性の高い菓子パン製品の研究が中心となり,食パンの研究開発,改良策が放置されたことにある. これらの解決策としてすべての製造工程(焼き上げ工程のみ残した状態) を終えた生地を- 20 ℃で包装貯蔵し,通常製法による食パンと同品質の製品の製造を可能にするべく親油性界面活性剤Glyceryl monostearate添加による効果を検討した. 結果,親油性界面活性剤 0. 1 ～ 0. 5 %(小麦粉に対して) 添加区ではほとんど効果はなく,冷凍生地内面はだんご状で塊状部や海綿状部が混在し不均一で伸長度,針入度,弾力度,切断度などは過度となり,膨張度,水分含有度は過不足となり極めて劣悪な生地となり,解凍時ではだれを生じ,製品食パンにおいてもこれらの劣化性が同様の物性度を呈し劣悪な製品となり,貯蔵期間も短かく 5 日までとなる。一方添加率 1. 0, 3. 0 %区では前述の様な粗雑にして劣悪な傾向が認められず,冷凍生地の貯蔵性は安定的であり,貯蔵 20 日間でも十分健全な状態で保持され,製品食パンの内面はCO_ 2 発生形跡も十分でグルテン形成も十分で微細気胞が均一で渦巻状の極めて良好な製品食パンの製造が可能であった. 対照区の活性グルテン 5. 0 %示加区より内面すだち,貯蔵期間ともにかなり改良された. これらは親油性界面活性剤の添加によりデンプンの吸水性の低下による膨潤を抑制し,水分とグルテンをより水和させて水分移動を調整し保水力を高め,デンプンとグルテンの界面に沿って単分子膜状に分散し,イースト及び生地の老化を防止したためと思われる. 総合的結果より,親油性界面活性剤を小麦粉に対して 1. 0, 3. 0 %添加を行えばリーンな材料配合の冷凍パン生地においても良質の食パン製造が十分可能であり,貯蔵期間も 20 日間と大きく延長することが可能であり,作業性も極めて良好で能率的となり,消費者の嗜好に合致し,消費者各自が冷凍生地を買い求め,自己の嗜好に合せて焼き上げることが十分可能となることが認められた...|$|E
