40|$|The loss {{of natural}} enemies {{is thought to}} explain why certain {{invasive}} species <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>spectacularly</b> successful in their introduced range. However, if losing natural enemies leads to unregulated population growth, this implies that native species are themselves normally subject to natural enemy regulation. One possible widespread mechanism of natural enemy regulation is negative soil feedbacks, in which resident species growing on home soils are disadvantaged because of a build-up of species-specific soil pathogens. Here we construct simple models in which pathogens cause resident species to suffer reduced competitive ability on home soils and consider the consequences of such pathogen regulation for potential invading species. We show that the probability of successful invasion and its timescale depend strongly on the competitive ability of the invader on resident soils, but are unaffected by {{whether or not the}} invader also suffers reduced competitive ability on home soils (i. e. pathogen regulation). This is because, at the start of an invasion, the invader is rare and hence mostly encounters resident soils. However, the lack of pathogen regulation does allow the invader to achieve an unusually high population density. We also show that increasing resident species diversity in a pathogen-regulated community increases invasion resistance by reducing the frequency of home-site encounters. Diverse communities are more resistant to invasion than monocultures of the component species: they preclude a greater range of potential invaders, slow the timescale of invasion and reduce invader population size. Thus, widespread pathogen regulation of resident species is a potential explanation for the empirical observation that diverse communities are more invasion resistant. © 2009 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Geology of the National Parks (GNP) is an introductory-level geology {{course for}} non-science majors at many colleges and universities. GNP is {{designed}} to teach geology by capitalizing on student interest in renowned parks where geologic features and histories <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>spectacularly</b> displayed. At the University of South Florida (USF), GNP is delivered online in a succession of exercises. In the past, most exercises involved virtual field trips and included writing assignments addressing specific questions about the trips. Some of those exercises have now been traded out for self-contained spreadsheet modules that we have created for a new Geology of National Parks Collection in the online Spreadsheets Across the Curriculum (SSAC) Library. The intent of this course modification is two-fold: (1) to bolster the quantitative literacy (QL) dimension, which aligns the course better with a new University general education requirement, and (2) to add environmental-geologic data and analysis, which aligns the course with the National Park Service’s Natural Resource Challenge initiative to integrate inventory and monitoring data with parkland management. Our 20 new SSAC modules were created with cooperation from NPS Research Learning Centers at Point Reyes NS, Yellowstone NP, Great Smoky NP, Indiana Dunes NL, Congaree NP, Mammoth Cave NP, Glacier NP, and the National Capital Parks. QL concepts and skills are the usual suspects: unit conversions, percent increase, ratios, probability, and similar foundational-mathematics topics relevant to a world awash in numbers. Environmental-geologic topics include recurrence interval of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes; probability of water levels submerging a boardwalk; geyser eruption intervals; air quality and visibility in a park known for its views; environmental legacy of copper mining (Upper Peninsula); the USGS coastal vulnerability index vs. geomorphology along a Pacific shoreline; assessing the effect of culvert repair {{on the ability of}} salmon to reach their spawning sites; shrinking glaciers; rate of shoreline and dune migration; nitrate and phosphate in an urban creek; areal rate of discharge generation in mountain watersheds...|$|R
