[...] The term 'monastery' seems to have been used by the Vatican scribes to translate the Syriac word umra, which could also mean a large church, and at least eleven of these 'monasteries' (particularly those in the mountainous Hakkari district), were merely churches (<b>Mar</b> Giwargis <b>in</b> Gazarta, <b>Mar</b> Pinhas <b>in</b> Hawsar, <b>Mar</b> Abdisho <b>in</b> Nerem, <b>Mar</b> Tahmasgard, Mar Pethion and <b>Mar</b> Thomas <b>in</b> Kirkuk, <b>Mar</b> Giwargis <b>in</b> Ashitha, <b>Mar</b> Shallita <b>in</b> Qudshanis, <b>Mar</b> Abdisho and <b>Mar</b> Qardagh <b>in</b> Beth Aziza, <b>Mar</b> Pethion <b>in</b> Mazraa, <b>Mar</b> Zaya <b>in</b> Matha d'Mar Zaya and perhaps others).

5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E

5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E

40|$|Imputed {{values in}} surveys are often {{generated}} {{under the assumption}} that the sampling mechanism is non-informative (or ignorable) and the study variable is missing at random (MAR). When the sampling design is informative, the assumption of <b>MAR</b> <b>in</b> the population does not necessarily imply <b>MAR</b> <b>in</b> the sample. In this case, the classical method of imputation using a model fitted to the sample data does not in general lead to unbiased estimation. To overcome this problem, we consider alternative approaches to imputation assuming <b>MAR</b> <b>in</b> the population. We compare the alternative imputation procedures through simulation and an application to estimation of mean erosion using data from the Conservation Effects Assessment Project...|$|R

5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> 1645.|$|E

Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding.

Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression.

5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of <b>Mars</b> <b>in</b> the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
