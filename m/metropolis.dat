5000|$|Over the millennia the {{population}} of the world has grown and all available land surface has been covered with a single city, divided into areas called <b>metropolises</b> that are analogous to nations. The <b>metropolises</b> have governments that span the gamut from democracies to dictatorships; [...] "Metropolitan" [...] is used as a title for powerful individuals who rule entire <b>metropolises.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{local churches}} of the Ecumenical Patriarchate consist of six archdioceses, eight churches, and 18 <b>metropolises,</b> {{each of which}} reports {{directly}} to the Patriarch of Constantinople with no intervening authority. In addition, three of the six archdioceses have internal <b>metropolises</b> (17 in all), which are part of their respective archdioceses rather than distinct administrative entities, unlike the other <b>metropolises.</b> [...] Two of the churches of the patriarchate are autonomous, the Finnish Orthodox Church and the Estonian Orthodox Church.|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{conceptualization of}} the world system of cities is proposed based both on {{an extension of the}} ecological rationale for a national system of cities and on insights from world-system theory and research. The core concepts are divided into five categories: (1) the key function, (2) hierarchy and dominance—the verti-cal dimension, (3) specialization—the horizontal dimension, (4) interaction, and (5) dynamics. As a test of selected ideas, the dominance of core international fi-nancial <b>metropolises</b> over peripheral South American cities is examined; the mea-sure is the international bank headquarters–branch office link. The hypotheses of ecological dominance were confirmed. The core <b>metropolises</b> dominate the periph-eral <b>metropolises</b> of South America, and within the core the upper level <b>metropolises</b> exert greater dominance than the lower level <b>metropolises.</b> The na-tional <b>metropolises</b> of South America are the key intermediaries with international <b>metropolises,</b> but the former have few links among themselves. The world system of cities based on finance seems to be organized independently of national or world regional boundaries. The global expansion of multinational corporations since 1950 has cre-ated a network of international economic transactions within and between businesses such as industrial firms, banks, commodity firms, and trading companies. Ecdlogists argue that these intercommunity transactions are controlled and coordinated by organizations which are concentrated in metropolises; therefore, urban ecological inquiry about the system of cities should include the world scale. The system of cities in the United States, however, {{has been the focus of}} ecologists; they have neglected the world system of cities (Wilson). The purpose of this paper is to extend the eco-logical framework for examining the system of cities to the world scale...|$|R
