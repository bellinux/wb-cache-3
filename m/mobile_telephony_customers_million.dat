Taiwan had a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> penetration of 108 % in 2002, ranking first in the world. This study analyzes this accelerated diffusion in terms of growth model and determinants of the diffusion rate. To eliminate the inherent uncertainty associated with choosing the optimal growth model, this study compares the performance of three conventional models, namely Gompertz, Logistic and Bass, to identify the most appropriate model, and to distinguish the forces driving the diffusion rate. Empirical {{results indicate that the}} most appropriate model is the Logistic model. Network externalities, which this study shows to be the same as the imitation effect in the Bass model, explain the superiority of the Logistic model. Moreover, market competition, which markedly reduces service prices, is identified as a primary driver of the diffusion rate of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> in Taiwan.

It investigates what effect <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> has had on the bridging of a broader digital divide, conceived of in terms of inequalities in access to information and communication technologies between Africa {{and the rest of the}} world, as well within Africa itself. It concludes that the boom in <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> has had far-reaching impacts on the continent at all levels of African society. In particular, mobile phones have had a significant economic impact on the continent, which the author argues has been from the bottom up -affecting greatly the base of the economic pyramid and the informal sector. <b>Mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> has however not made a significant impact in the bridging of the digital divide conceived of in terms of access to the internet.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how Bangladeshi farmers interact with <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> and how they negotiate the resulting difficulties. In doing so, the paper seeks to identify how farmers integrate <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> into their daily lives, and what factors facilitate and limit their use of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on ethnographic observation, interviews and focus group discussions, collected through four months of fieldwork, conducted in two remote areas of Bangladesh. Findings – It was found that Bangladeshi farmers' use of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> is inhibited due to language barriers, a lack of literacy, unfamiliar English terminologies, inappropriate translation to local language (Bengali) and financial constraints. However, the social, occupational and psychological benefits from <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> motivate them to use and appropriate it through inventive use and adaptation. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that current understanding of usability needs to be interwoven with that about the appropriation of technology in order to develop a better understanding of the use and consequent integration of a technology in daily lives. Practical implications – The paper adds to the argument for a bottom-up approach for ICT-enabled intervention in development activities and for the <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> manufacturers and network providers it contributes to understanding of the rural consumer market of a developing country. Originality/value – The paper presents an original conceptual diagram that combines the concept of usability and appropriation...|$|R
