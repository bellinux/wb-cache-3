5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E
25|$|Turning is a <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> {{process for}} {{producing}} a cylindrical {{surface with a}} single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool is fed into it radially, axially or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and axial feeds is called profiling.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial heating {{processes}} can be broadly {{categorized as}} low-temperature (to about [...] ), medium-temperature (between [...] ), and high-temperature (beyond [...] ). Low-temperature processes include baking and drying, curing finishes, soldering, molding and shaping plastics. Medium temperature processes include melting plastics and some non-metals for casting or reshaping, {{as well as}} annealing, stress-relieving and heat-treating metals. High-temperature processes include steelmaking, brazing, welding, casting <b>metals,</b> <b>cutting,</b> smelting and the preparation of some chemicals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to select the best technology for <b>cutting</b> <b>metal.</b> In this article i will briefly discuss the different ways of <b>cutting</b> <b>metal,</b> such as water jet cutting, as well as laser and plasma cutting. These techniques and their comparisons are illustrated in a table to highlight the differences between them. Further comments are then provided on the key aspects of this comparative method, leading to the appropriate conclusions, which responds to the seemingly simple question: Which technology is best suited to <b>cutting</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Metallic {{compounds}} such as mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium {{and other}} heavy metals {{are concentrated in}} the structures. Unfortunately, these metals slowly poison the surrounding soil. Regular soil removal is {{required in order to}} prevent metals from dissolving and releasing back into the environment. Some bioswales are designed to include hyperaccumulator plant species. These plants absorb but do not transform the <b>metals.</b> <b>Cuttings</b> from these plants often decompose back into the pond or are pruned by gardening services that do not know the compost they are collecting is poisonous.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{machinery}} was made mostly of wood with iron parts. By the mid century machines were being increasingly of all iron, which {{allowed them to}} operate at higher speeds and with higher precision. The demand for machinery created a machine tool industry that designed and manufactured lathes, metal planers, shapers and other precision <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> tools.|$|E
25|$|Every {{conceivable}} {{method of}} applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, {{with the best}} choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an oil-water emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the splatter and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.|$|E
25|$|Although 18th-century {{accounts}} of European explorers traveling {{along the coast}} indicate that decorated interior and exterior house posts existed prior to 1800, the posts were smaller and fewer in number than in subsequent decades. Prior to the 19th century, the lack of efficient carving tools, along with sufficient wealth and leisure time to devote to the craft, delayed the development of elaborately carved, freestanding poles. Before iron and steel arrived in the area, Natives used tools made of stone, shells, or beaver teeth for carving. The process was slow and laborious; axes were unknown. By the late eighteenth century, the use of <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> tools enabled more complex carvings and increased production of totem poles. The tall monumental poles appearing in front of native homes in coastal villages probably did not appear until after {{the beginning of the}} nineteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>cutting</b> [...] generates heat due to {{friction}} and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it {{is a poor}} coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} tool wear.|$|E
60|$|And {{you will}} observe {{that the only}} {{engravings}} which bear imperishable value are, indeed, in this kind. It is true that, in wood-cutting, both DÃ¼rer and Holbein, as in our own days Leech and Tenniel, have workmen under them who can do all they want. But in <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> it is not so. For, as I have told you, in <b>metal</b> <b>cutting,</b> ultimate perfection of Line has to be reached; {{and it can be}} reached by none but a master's hand; nor by his, unless in the very moment and act of designing. Never, unless under the vivid first force of imagination and intellect, can the Line have its full value. And for this high reason, gentlemen, that paradox which perhaps seemed to you so daring, is nevertheless deeply and finally true, that while a woodcut may be laboriously finished, a grand engraving on metal must be comparatively incomplete. For it must be done, throughout, with the full fire of temper in it, visibly governing its lines, as the wind does the fibers of cloud.|$|E
50|$|Because extreme {{temperatures}} are {{generated in the}} cutting zone, where the cutting edges shear through the material at very high speeds, coatings are added to deflect the heat away from the tool. Coatings offer varying degrees of heat protection, or hot hardness, {{as well as other}} unique performance characteristics, depending on their formulation. Tools coated with each formulation will work well in some materials and poorly in others. Coatings also provide a degree of lubricity that helps evacuate <b>metal</b> <b>cuttings</b> or chips, from the cutting zone. This prevents clogs and removes chips before they can melt and bond with the tool's cutting edges, which ruins the tool.|$|R

Prior to combination the individual waste streams had different codes {{depending on the}} particular generating process and waste characteristics. The largest streams were CWC 132, 791, 134, 792. Several smaller waste streams were also included. This combined waste stream was treated at LLNL's waste treatment facility using a vacuum filtration and cool vapor evaporation process in preparation for discharge to sanitary sewer.
