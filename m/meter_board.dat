40|$|Abstract: This {{reference}} design {{provides a}} complete demonstration platform for using industrial/scientific/medical radio frequency (ISM-RF) products in an {{automatic meter reading}} (AMR) application. This document includes the hardware, firmware, and system structure requirements for implementing an AMR design that demonstrates operation with a physical water meter. General Description The MAX 7032 transceiver reference design (RD) is a self-contained evaluation platform for exercising the device as a wireless automatic meter reading (AMR) and water meter demo system. With {{the use of the}} Maxim USB-to-JTAG board (MAXQJTAG-USB), the MAXQ 610 on both the handheld interface (HHI) unit and the various meter (MTR) radio modules can be programmed by the end user. The <b>meter</b> <b>board</b> enables basic human interaction through a single momentary switch input and an LED for visual feedback. The MTR is designed to be compact, providing a self-contained transceiver board with a radio, microcontroller, and multiple "ports " for connecting various meter inputs to the system.

40|$|This BachelorÂ´s Theis is {{concerned}} with current possibilities of the wiring systems in family houses, flats and bigger complexes of buildings. The aim is to describe and to compare the classical and the intelligent solutions of wiring in a family house. First of all it starts out with the connection process of the family house to the electrical power system. After that the designing principles of power and data distribution of the classical wiring are described. Next part deals with the intelligent wiring, its origination, the techniques of its connection and operation. Following part is linked to it with various types of selected intelligent wirings which {{are available in the}} Czech Republic. The specific methods of connection to the bus, possibilities of utilization and the advantages and disavantages are described with these systems. On the basis of gained theoretical knowledge the production of classical and consequently intelligent wiring of the particular family house project is detailed in the next part. This section refers to the complete project documentation consisting of all terms required for the building control. These terms are the technical report, the specification, the list of equipment, the plans of both floor projections, the plan of lightning conductor, the grounding, the schematic diagram of the flat swith board, the <b>meter</b> <b>board</b> cabinet and the weak-current distributor.
