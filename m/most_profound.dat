50|$|This altarpiece by Botticini {{is unique}} in its {{remarkable}} inclusion of plants and animals, unlike any other Florentine painting of its period. The piece {{is often described as}} the <b>most</b> artistically <b>profound</b> work that Botticini produced during his life.|$|R
5|$|Frusciante's {{first major}} {{influence}} was Jimi Hendrix. He then saw The Red Hot Chili Peppers (at that point, The {{was part of}} their name) in concert in 1985, after which their then-guitarist Hillel Slovak became his second major influence, with Frusciante coming to idolize Slovak. Although Hendrix and Slovak were arguably Frusciante's <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> influences, he was also inspired by glam rock artists David Bowie, and T. Rex; as well as avant-garde acts such as Syd Barrett, Captain Beefheart, The Residents, The Velvet Underground, Neu!, Van der Graaf Generator, Frank Zappa, and Kraftwerk.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{is one of}} the highest-income {{places in}} the United States with a {{population}} greater than one million. , Manhattan's cost of living was the highest in the United States, but the borough also contained the country's <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> level of income inequality. Manhattan is also the United States county with the highest per capita income, being the sole county whose per capita income exceeded $100,000 in 2010. However, from 2011–2015 Census data of New York County, the per capita income was recorded in 2015 dollars as $64,993, with the median household income at $72,871, and poverty at 17.6%.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, the <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In {{the latter half of}} the sixteenth century, orchestration came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E

50|$|Similarities between Calle Mayor {{story and}} {{environment}} and Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni have been pointed out.Calle Mayor was Blair's first performance outside the US, and she played brilliantly her role (which bore a rather close resemblance to her character in her previous success, Marty). For Suárez, {{this was his}} <b>most</b> dramatically <b>profound</b> role, and it shot him momentarily to fame all across Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In Sophisims of free trade, John Byles championed {{protectionism}} and refuted the [...] "let it alone," [...] i.e., laissez faire system. Industries do not {{spring up}} out of nowhere, and home markets needs protectionism to stave off foreign competition. Byles said, [...] "But in truth the natural course of commercial affairs uninfluenced by legislation is impossible." [...] He could not conceive where England could have been at in 1851 without protectionism. He was convinced that new nations as well as old nations needed protectionism. He knew individuals {{and the private sector}} did not have the resources to create an immense future. Public wisdom had to do this monumental feat. Moreover, Byles called humanity the <b>most</b> <b>profoundest</b> cause. He stated that those who regard man in high esteem should not be subjected to unbridled foreign commerce. In sum, Byles saw protection as not a source of calamity and peril as free traders depicted it, but as a policy that spread industry and brought water, economic life where there was none.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{a stormy}} {{introduction}} in dotted rhythm, the largo is serene, almost nocturne-like; an immensely beautiful melody is introduced, {{followed by a}} mellow and expansive middle section, again characterised by quaver figuration {{in the background of}} an intensely harmonic line, separating the more cantabile outer sections in B major. It is the <b>most</b> musically <b>profound</b> of the movements (Kraemer, 1991), in terms of a sustained melody and innovative harmonic progression; it rivals the extensive first movement in length alone.|$|R

It's not just a first-rate {{drinking}} novel and a first-rate elegiac failure novel and a first-rate Fred Exley-ish novel about loserdom (loserdom being the song Kelman was born to sing).

In [...] poetry {{there is not}} his like, when he rose to his full power; he was [...] a philosopher, the immensity of whose mind cannot be gauged by [...] {{anything}} he has left behind; a critic, the subtlest and <b>most</b> [...] <b>profound</b> of his time. Yet these vast and varied powers flowed away [...] in the shifting sands of talk; and what remains is but what the few [...] land-locked pools are to the receding ocean which has left them [...] casually behind without sensible diminution of its [...] waters." ...|$|R
25|$|The sole {{subject of}} his {{philosophy}} is living subjectivity, {{which is to say}} the real life of living individuals. This subject is found in all his work and ensures its deep unity in spite of the diversity of themes he tackled.

25|$|A {{watershed}} {{of development}} and possibly symbolically expressing the <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> maturing within the celebrant movement were the series of conferences held at Pallotti College, Millgrove, northeast of Melbourne from 1994 to 1999. The committee of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants decided that the Conferences should explore the nature of celebrancy itself and focus primarily on ceremony and ritual in society.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{wrote for}} single instruments, duets, and small ensembles. Many of his solo works, {{such as his}} six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV 1001–1006) and his six cello suites (BWV 1007–1012), are widely {{considered}} among the <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> in the repertoire.

40|$|Modernization {{of culture}} {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> complicated, <b>profound</b> and obscure issues in human social and {{historical}} development and changes. It occupies a core position in the overall layout of Chinese social modernization construction and it prescribes the basic target and development direction of Chinese modernization construction. That is to say, it is an issue about how to realize development of human being and modernization of human being. Thus, it is necessary for us to re-survey the issue of modernization of Chinese culture and reveal the internal mechanism and development rule of modernization of Chinese culture...|$|R

Jackson writes [...] rJe sGam-po-pa had discovered within himself the treasure of innate wisdom, and for him it was also essential to try to convey it to others. And convey it he did, on a scale never before attempted within his lineage. To do so, he bent the traditional rules restricting how certain Vajrayana teachings could be transmitted. He did this out of compassion for his students, in order to establish them in what was <b>most</b> important: <b>profound</b> meditative practice and insight." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{devaluation}} of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> {{and went into the}} purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, the Great Depression had the <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> {{impact in}} the German Reich and the United States. In both {{countries}} the pressure to reform {{and the perception of}} the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} effect {{was that the}} politically weakened Commission was unable {{to react to the}} beginning of the Kosovo War and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the <b>most</b> <b>profound,</b> the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.|$|E
