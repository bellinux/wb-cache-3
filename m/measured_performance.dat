25|$|Conversely, perverse {{learning}} {{results in}} stagnating performance levels within an organization because it leads individuals {{to focus on}} improving their outcome in performance measures, rather than their actual performance. For example, teachers may often dedicate their efforts towards improving their students' test scores rather than their teaching style. Similar to positive learning, perverse learning leads to a decreased variability in <b>measured</b> <b>performance</b> levels, but this performance improvement is artificial.|$|E

In a <b>measured</b> <b>performance,</b> Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the half guard position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the full mount, where punches followed to continue the ground and pound assault from the BJJ specialist.|$|E
25|$|The pot {{allocations}} {{were based}} on the UEFA national team coefficient which <b>measured</b> <b>performance</b> of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored. As host country, Portugal were unranked and automatically placed in Group A. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot. For reference, the European zonal rankings calculated for FIFA World Rankings from 19 November 2003 are given in tables below.|$|E

While this may be an intuitive problem setting, to <b>measure</b> <b>performance</b> in absolute terms, the dominating approach in the financial industry is rather to <b>measure</b> <b>performance</b> in excess of an externally given benchmark index.

25|$|To {{illustrate}} the comparative performance of Alpha-based systems, some SPEC performance numbers (SPECint95, SPECfp95) are listed below. Note that the SPEC results claim {{to report the}} <b>measured</b> <b>performance</b> of a whole computer system (CPU, bus, memory, compiler optimizer), not just the CPU. Also note that the benchmark and scale changed from 1992 to 1995. However, the figures give a rough impression {{of the performance of}} the Alpha architecture (64-bit), compared with the contemporary HP (64-bit) and Intel-based offerings (32-bit). Perhaps the most obvious trend is that while Intel could always get reasonably close to Alpha in integer performance, in floating point performance the difference was considerable. On the other side, HP (PA-RISC) is also reasonably close to Alpha, but these CPUs are running at significantly lower clock rates (MHz). The tables lack two important values: the power consumption and the price of a CPU.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly <b>measured</b> <b>performance,</b> evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E
