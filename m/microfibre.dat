In particular, the flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength increase at an optimum fibre content of 2  wt%. Further, adding glass <b>microfibres</b> to a plain geopolymer matrix has a significant effect on the pre-cracking behaviour. It substantially enhances the post-cracking response...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to model the energy consumed in generating cellulose <b>microfibres,</b> 1 μm in diameter, as reinforcing agents, by refining bleached softwood kraft pulp in a PFI mill. An average initial fibre diameter of 13 μm was assumed. 125, 000 revolutions in a PFI mill was found to produce a high yield of fibres 1. 3 μm in diameter, and the minimum refining energy needed to reduce the fibre diameter to 1. 3 μm was estimated as 1875 kJ for each 24 g charge in the PFI mill. Since elastic deformation of the fibres was found to be negligible, the size reduction was assumed to follow Rittinger’s Law. This gave a Rittinger’s constant of 28 J. m/kg for the given system. Using this value of Rittinger’s constant, the energy required to generate <b>microfibres</b> 1 μm in diameter was predicted as 2480 kJ for each 24 g charge in the PFI mill. It was deduced that <b>microfibres</b> generated in this way would cost a minimum of $ 2. 37 per kilogram. Hence even this relatively inefficient method of grinding would not be prohibitively expensive, provided the resulting <b>microfibres</b> can be used as high quality reinforcements...|$|R
40|$|Metal-binding polymer fibres have {{attracted}} major attention for diverse applications in membranes for metal sequestration from waste waters, non-woven wound dressings, matrices for photocatalysis, and many more. This paper reports {{the design and}} synthesis of an 8 -hydroxyquinoline-based zinc-binding styrenic monomer, QuiBoc. Its subsequent polymerisation by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) yielded well-defined polymers, PQuiBoc, of controllable molar masses (6 and 12 kg mol− 1) with low dispersities (Đ, Mw/Mn < 1. 3). Protected (PQuiBoc) and deprotected (PQuiOH) derivatives of the polymer exhibited a high zinc-binding capacity, as determined by semi-quantitative SEM/EDXA analyses, allowing the electrospinning of <b>microfibres</b> from a PQuiBoc/polystyrene (PS) blend {{without the need for}} removal of the protecting group. Simple “dip-coating” of the fibrous mats into ZnO suspensions showed that PQuiBoc/PS <b>microfibres</b> with only 20 % PQuiBoc content had almost three-fold higher loadings of ZnO (29 %) in comparison to neat PS <b>microfibres</b> (11 %) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{contraction}} {{of the entire}} thrombocyte {{appears to be a}} primary factor in the retracting mechanism of dogfish (Musteltis canis) in vitro blood clots. Microtubules probably account for the condensation and lobation of the nucleus, and the impetus for cytoplasmic contraction appears to be dependent upon the grouping of <b>microfibres</b> of dimensions difficult to measure. These <b>microfibres</b> show a striking resemblance to materials stored within adjacent vesicles. A second type of fibre (60 A in diameter) extends from the bases of pseudopods into the adjacent matrix. There also appears to be partial engulfment of an extracellular amorphous material by the plasma membrane. The ultrastructure of the thrombocyte during clot retraction shows some striking similarities to the mammalian platelet under similar conditions, and leads one to believe a phylogenetic relationship exists between these haemostatic cells...|$|R
30|$|Cellulose fibres were {{isolated}} from P. pinnata seed hull by sequential chlorination and alkaline {{process and the}} resultant <b>microfibres</b> were characterized by SEM, DLS, FTIR, NMR, TGA and XRD analyses. Cellulose <b>microfibres</b> were in diameter ranging from 6 to 8 μm and mean hydrodynamic diameter of 58.4  nm. NMR and FTIR analyses confirmed the removal of hemicellulose and lignin. Crystallinity of the fibres was increased by 72.79 % after the treatment with CI of 47 % for the isolated cellulose fibres. Thermal behaviour of the fibres had improved as evidenced by an increase of degradation temperature by 70  °C. Most potential observation to be considered was the degradation temperature of the isolated cellulose fibres being higher than 200  °C, which could broaden its application potential {{in the fields of}} biocomposite processing. A notable increase in crystallinity and the dimension similar to the cellulose fibres isolated from other resources by various chemical treatments was a significant feature of the resource and the isolation method adopted in the present study. Thus the present work substantiates the success of the sequential chlorination and alkaline extraction process solely contributing to obtain smaller diameter and crystalline cellulose <b>microfibres</b> from P. pinnata seed hull. These biofibres have potential application as filler, embroiling in the process of biodegradable composites to enhance their properties.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the effect of early {{shrinkage}} is important to prevent aesthetic defects and, especially, to avoid the reduction of durability of concrete elements due to surface cracking. This paper presents the application of a new digital imaging methodology to quantify the effects of polypropylene macrofibres, <b>microfibres</b> and glycolether shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA) on early shrinkage cracking. This way, the effectiveness of different admixtures incorporated into the common base mix design of concrete can be compared impartially through the total cracking area, maximum crack width, total crack length, among other parameters that this methodology provides. The results demonstrate the great capacity of the methodology to isolate and determine the characteristics of an entire cracking pattern, and the similarity of behaviour between admixtures.

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze and explain the {{formation}} of the constructive micrite envelope in the vadose continental environment. This constructive micrite envelope shows a wide variety of textural components. The principal textural components are: microorganisms, micritic and microspar LMC cement, whisker crystals, <b>microfibres</b> and aggregates of LMC acicular crystals. The main microorganisms are hyphae fungi, although actynomicetes and bacteries also occur. The constructive micrite envelope is due to the action of calcified filaments (hyphae fungi) which collapse and coalesce forming an intertwined mesh as well as due to the precipitation of micritic and microspar cement. The whisker crystals, <b>microfibres</b> and aggregates of LMC acicular crystals are secondary microtextures. Constructive micrite envelopes does not indicate a specific diagenetic environment. The constructive micrite envelopes present irregularities or bumps at the outer surface of the grains, and the destructive micrite envelopes present irregularities towards the grain interior.
