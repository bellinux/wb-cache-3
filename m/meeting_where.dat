This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement <b>meeting,</b> <b>where</b> he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide.

5|$|Bret Hart later {{claimed that}} during a {{conversation}} with Vince McMahon, {{he was told that}} Hulk Hogan refused to drop the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to him. However, Hulk Hogan stated that, during {{a conversation with}} Vince McMahon, a deal was made for Hogan to drop the belt to the top heel at the time, Yokozuna, at the following King of The Ring. All three men eventually wound up in a <b>meeting,</b> <b>where</b> McMahon outlined the plan to have Hogan drop the belt to Yokozuna and denied telling Bret that Hogan refused to drop the championship to him.|$|E

5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal.

Radio 4 liked the idea and a pilot was made. Tyler went on to produce and direct Bigipedia.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{chapters}} of the book cover the origins {{and implementation of the}} school, and other topics in childrearing. Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of self-regulation, where kids choose whether to go to lessons and how they want to live freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide <b>meeting</b> <b>where</b> students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E
5|$|At one tour date in England, the {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band <b>meeting</b> <b>where</b> Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment {{to the rest of the}} group. After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual <b>meeting,</b> <b>where</b> he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand <b>meeting</b> <b>where</b> a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|Jolie has fronted a {{campaign}} against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation. Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers <b>meeting,</b> <b>where</b> the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, {{which resulted in a}} protocol endorsed by 151 nations.|$|E

An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} end of Smith's front-line {{political}} career—Gerald Smith (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a <b>meeting</b> <b>where</b> the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's ZANU–Ndonga party and Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The United Front quickly failed, largely {{due to the lack of}} common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.|$|E
5|$|While {{still being}} trained, Alejandro steals a black {{stallion}} resembling Tornado {{from the local}} garrison. De La Vega scolds Alejandro, claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief and adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, with De La Vega as his servant, and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. At the party he gains Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust {{to be invited to}} a secret <b>meeting</b> <b>where</b> several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, spiritual {{drunkenness}} {{can exist}} {{in nearly every}} Christian church where someone is in touch with prosperity theology. The most dangerous situations are the <b>meetings,</b> <b>where</b> the preacher preaches with the anointing of spiritual drunkenness, for example the <b>meetings</b> <b>where</b> Hagin or Howard-Browne laugh the so-called holy laughter. In these kinds of situations, {{it is nearly impossible}} to avoid the effects of the phenomenon, especially if the preacher comes and puts his hand on your body just because he wants to.|$|R
