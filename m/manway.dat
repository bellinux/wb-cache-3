40|$|An {{underground}} {{medium frequency}} radio communications {{system has been}} developed and demonstrated in both coal and metal/non metal mines. The principal advantage of the system are its low cost, ease of installation {{and the ability to}} provide radio communications to any vehicle or roving miner in the underground mine. The system provides high quality radio coverage in work areas and along <b>manways</b> with existing "wireplant" conductors. The conductors include AC power cable, telephone cable, metal water and high pressure air pipes, etc. The measured communications range from the base station to mobile transceiver exceeded 12, 500 ft without the use of repeaters. A cost/benefit analysis shows that the initial cost of the equipment can be returned 2 - 6 times in the first year. The mine productivity increases by approx. 13 percent...|$|R

The Houdini robot addresses the need for vehicle-based, rugged, remote manipulation systems that can perform waste retrieval, characterization, and inspection tasks. Houdini-I was delivered to ORNL in September 1996, deployed in a cold test facility in November, and first deployed in the gunite tanks in June 1997. Since then, it has seen continuous (still on-going) service at ORNL, providing {{a critical role in}} the cleanup of two gunite tanks, W- 3 and W- 4, in the GAAT NTF.

The baseline for the Silo 3 Project is to remove a portion of this material from the silo pneumatically by inserting vacuum retrieval wands and/or hoses in existing <b>manways</b> on the silo dome. After the loose material has been removed by the pneumatic system, the project intends to cut {{an opening in the}} silo wall and use a mechanical excavator to complete removal of the remaining material, including possible combination with pneumatic retrieval. Fluor Fernald previously requested that the Department of Energy Environmental Management Office of Science and Technology provide a Technical Assistance Team to review this approach. One of the key recommendations made by this team was to assess the wand operability, effectiveness, reliability, and safety in a mock-up test. A team was convened to develop the test plan, build the demonstration test loop, and perform the tests. The tests focused primarily on the operability of the system, and to a significantly lesser extent process performance. This report documents the results for the testing completed in April 2003.

40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) {{addresses}} one {{of three}} leachfield systems associated with Test Cell A, which is located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The NTS is approximately 105 kilometers (km) (65 miles [mi]) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 1 - 1). Corrective Action Unit 500 is comprised of the Test Cell A Septic System (CAS 25 - 04 - 05) and the associated leachfield system presented in Figure 1 - 1 (FFACO, 1996). The leachfield is located 60 meters (m) (200 feet [ft]) southeast of the Building 3124 gate, and approximately 45 m (150 ft) southwest of Building 3116 at Test Cell A. Test Cell A operated during the 1960 s to support nuclear rocket reactor testing {{as part of the}} Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) (SNPO, 1970). Various operations within Buildings 3113 B (Mechanical Equipment Room), 3115 (Helium Compressor Station), 3116 (Pump House), a water tank drain and overflow, a ''yard and equipment drain system'' outside of Building 3116, and a trailer have resulted in potentially hazardous effluent releases to the leachfield system (DOE, 1988 a). The leachfield system components include discharge lines, <b>manways,</b> a septic tank, an outfall line, a diversion chamber, and a 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) leachfield (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 3 - 1 for explanation of terminology). In addition, engineering drawings show an outfall system {{that may or may not}} be connected to the CAU 500 leachfield. In general, effluent contributed to the leachfield was sanitary wastewater associated with floor drains, toilet and lavatory facilities in Building 3113 B and floor drains in the remaining source buildings. The surface and subsurface soils in the vicinity of the collection system, outfall, and leachfield may have been impacted by effluent containing contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) generated by support activities associated with Test Cell A reactor testing operations...|$|R

50|$|On {{the day of}} the explosion, {{operations}} appeared normal {{until after}} the steam was turned off and the polymer initiating solution was pumped into the reactor. The operator in charge noted that initially the reaction did not proceed as vigorously as expected, but later the solvent evaporated and the condensed solvent flow returning to the reactor appeared within normal range. A few minutes later, the operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor <b>manway.</b> The irritating vapor forced him out of the building. Three other employees also left the building because of the vapors. The operator reentered the building wearing a respirator and started emergency cooling water flow to the reactor. The building exploded less than 30 seconds after he exited the second time. The US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) stated that the solvent vapor leaked from the overheated and over-pressurised process reactor, forming a flammable vapour cloud inside the building that ignited.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A midloop operation test was performed in 1992 at the BETHSY Integral Test Facility in Grenoble, France. The purpose of this experiment was to produce data {{that could be used to}} assess the performance of thermal hydraulic codes under the conditions of low pressure and decay heat. The specific scenario of the test involved the loss of the residual heat removal system in a midloop operation with manways vents open in the pressurizer and at the steam generator. In participation with the International Standard Problem # 38, the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code was used to simulate the transient conducted experimentally at the BETHSY facility and assess its ability to accurately predict the observed phenomena. The overall conclusion is that the code performed quite well in terms of predicting macroscopic trends and their timing, but did not describe more specific thermal hydraulic phenomena accurately. Specific areas of disagreement included predicting water holdup cycles in the pressurizer, two-phase mixture levels in the guide tube, upper core void and temperature profiles, entrainment phenomena in the upper head bypass and mass flow ratios between the upper head bypass, pressurizer <b>manway,</b> and steam generator <b>manway.</b> The code predicted well the timing of the core uncovery and maximum core heater cladding temperature, and the integrated phasic mass flow rates at the steam generator <b>manway.</b> Some of these good predictions was the result of compensating errors in the prediction of component thermal hydraulic phenomena. The consequence of the poor code performance in predicting the pressurizer/pressurizer surge line phenomena was a substantial delay in the falloff of the initial system pressurization, an underestimation of the pressurizer integrated mass flow rate, and the emptying of the hot leg and upper plenum. Large mass errors were generated by the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. 1. 1 release of this code. Typical errors were around 20 % of the total system mass by the end of the transient...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Assessment of the ability of thermal hydraulic codes to correctly predict complex phenomena during reactor transients can be performed only by means of comparison against experimental data. The thermal hydraulic CATHARE V 1. 3 U computer program has been used to simulate International Standard Problem (ISP 38) experiment conducted at BETHSY Integral Test Facility located in Grenoble, France. BETHSY is an integral test facility modeling the three-loop, 2775 thermal NM Framatome Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Its main objectives are to contribute to the assessment of CATHARE code and of the physical basis of PWR Emergency Operating Procedures. This investigation dealt with experimental simulation of the loss of the Residual Heat Removal System (RHRS) during midloop operation. It involved opening of the pressurizer <b>manway</b> and the steam generator outlet plenum <b>manway</b> simultaneously with switching on the power of heating rods, thus simulating loss of the RHRS. The total power was kept unchanged with the level 138 kW throughout the test. Mass discharge through both manways led to core boiling and uncovery. A gravity feed injection of cold water was actuated in the cold leg when cladding temperature at the top of heating rods reached 250 C. The test was stopped when the primary cooling system was filled back to rnidloop level. The transient was executed on the HP 6400 workstation at Texas A&M University. The code predictions underestimated the time of the core uncovery and the actuation of the gravity feed injection due to the ovepredicted mass discharge through steain generator <b>manway</b> during the initial stage of the transient. This was probably caused by CATHARE's miscalculation of the phase separation effect at the hot leg/surge line tee junction and significant water entrainment into the surge line {{in the beginning of the}} test. It was found that the model of the upward tee junction needs to be refined for the low pressure range. Overall, the code's predictions were in a qualitative agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Short Tandem Repeats (STR) {{genotyping}} is {{a leading}} tool in forensic DNA analysis. In STR genotyping, alleles in a sample are identified by measuring their lengths to form a genetic profile. Forming a genetic profile is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As the technology matures, increasing demand for improved throughput and efficiency is fueling development of automated forensic DNA analysis systems. This thesis describes two algorithmic advances towards implementing such a system. In particular, the algorithms address motif-matching and pattern recognition issues that arise in processing a genetic profile.

40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank <b>manway</b> cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|E
