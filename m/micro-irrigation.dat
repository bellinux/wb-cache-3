40|$|For India, {{droughts}} {{and floods}} {{in one or}} the {{other parts of the country}} are regular features every year. History records 24 major drought years during 121 years from 1891 to 2012 that include 15 droughts since country’s independence. The year 2015 - 16 [July-June] was predicted to be a drought year since the India Meteorological Department had projected 88 % of normal monsoon rainfall. This is expected to produce 253. 16 million tons of food output much less than 265. 04 million tons in 2013 - 14. According to the latest press reports in April-May 2016 already quarter of the country, 313 districts, 1, 58, 205 villages and 4, 44, 281 dwellings in 12 States have been hit hard drying up traditional source of drinking water too as on end-April 2016. Coping with drought requires meticulous planning to conserve rainwater and economize on its use. Water-guzzling crops like sugarcane, paddy and even hybrid cotton need to be discouraged in water-stressed area. Around 15. 38 % of 650 billion cubic meters [BCM] water available for irrigation is used by sugarcane (the crop uses water from reservoirs as well as groundwater), which is planted on no more than 2. 5 % of India’s farmland. Sugarcane uses a disproportionate amount of water.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>micro-irrigation</b> systems. Many of the {{components}} are {{the same for all}} of these types of systems. Most systems typically include filters, pipes, valves, and tubing. The main difference is in the type of emission device that is used to deliver the water to the plants. Drip irrigation utilizes drip emitters that deliver water at very low rates. The typical range is 0.2 to 4.0 gallons per hour. In some systems, the emitters are installed manually {{on the outside of the}} tubing and placed where needed. Other systems might use integral dripperline or drip tape with the emitters already installed at a predetermined spacing. Micro-sprinklers, which can include fixed stream sprays and rotating spinners typically deliver water at a higher rate, such as 10 to 25 gallons per hour and will cover a larger area than drip emitters. These are more typically used in tree orchards where the plants are larger.The goal is to distribute water slowly in small volumes and target it to plants' root zones with less runoff or overspray than landscape and garden conventional spray and rotary sprinklers. The low volume allows the water to penetrate and be absorbed into slow-percolation soils, such as clay, minimizing water runoff.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a cost-effectiveness analysis of four water-saving irrigation techniques that are widely implemented in China {{to address the}} impacts of climate change: sprinkler irrigation, <b>micro-irrigation,</b> low-pressure pipe irrigation and channel lining. The aim is to thoroughly understand the economic feasibility of water-saving irrigation as an approach to coping with climate change. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, this study finds that water-saving irrigation is cost-effective in coping with climate change, and has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and for sustainable economic development. For the cost-effectiveness ratio of mitigation and adaptation, only that of channel lining is negative (for mitigation is − 43. 02 to − 73. 41 US$/t, for grain yield increase − 34. 35 to − 20. 13 US$/t, and for water saving − 0. 020 to − 0. 012 US$/m 3). Sprinkler irrigation has the highest incremental cost for mitigation (476. 03 – 691. 64 US$/t), because when sprinkler irrigation is used, there may be additional energy needs to meet water pressure requirements, which may increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional irrigation. For mitigation, in districts where the pumping head for pressure {{is lower than the}} critical energy saving head, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided. <b>Micro-irrigation</b> has the highest incremental cost for adaptation followed by sprinkler irrigation and low-pressure pipe irrigation, but when considering the revenues from improved adaptation, all of the measures assessed are economically feasible.
