5|$|Winnipeg {{has four}} major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city {{was subject to}} severe {{flooding}} in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826.

This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.|$|E
