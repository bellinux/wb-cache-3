5000|$|The song title (more specifically, {{the double}} {{negative}} grammatically corrected [...] "...but <b>my</b> <b>baby</b> loves nobody but me" [...] in some covered versions) has frequently led {{teachers and students}} of predicate logic to jestingly accuse the song's narrator of narcissism: The {{first half of the}} title, [...] "everybody loves my baby," [...] implies [...] "my <b>baby</b> loves <b>my</b> baby." [...] The second half, [...] "my baby loves nobody but me" [...] (formally, [...] "if I am not a given person, then <b>my</b> <b>baby</b> does not love that person"), is logically equivalent to [...] "if <b>my</b> <b>baby</b> loves a given person, then I am that person."

[...] From [...] "if <b>my</b> <b>baby</b> loves <b>my</b> <b>baby,</b> then I am my baby" [...] and [...] "my <b>baby</b> loves <b>my</b> baby" [...] it follows that [...] "I am my baby."
