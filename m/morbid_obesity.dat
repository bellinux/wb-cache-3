A sample of 91 obese female patients at a general practice are identified as having a significant personality pattern using the Sixteen Personality Factors Questionnaire (16 PF) and the Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire (N.

40|$|Leptin is the 16 kDa hormone {{product of}} the mouse obesity (ob) gene (Halaas et al., 1997).

One of the primary functions of leptin appears to be as a lipostat in the homeostasis of fat stores (adiposity); however, extensive research into obesity has revealed that leptin has many other phenotypic effects. Most are correlated with adiposity, including the regulation of metabolic rate, feeding and activity rates, body temperature and the onset of puberty (Flier, 1997).

The intervention period was 22 weeks (in all cases 3 times/wk of training for 22 weeks and 2 weeks for pre and post evaluation). All subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (25 - 30 % less energy intake than the daily energy expenditure estimated by accelerometry). 29 – 34 % of the total energy intake came from fat, 14 – 20 % from protein, and 50 – 55 % from carbohydrates.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the results and}} consequences on feeding behaviour of insertion of an laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a cohort of obese patients. Methods: Sixty patients suffering from <b>morbid</b> or severe <b>obesity</b> meeting the criteria defined by the French Agence nationale d'accréditation et d'évaluation en santé (ANAES) were examined in 2001 by a medical adviser from the Béziers medical service, then interviewed by telephone on average two years later. The analysis concerned five themes: evolutive complications, patient monitoring, clinical results, behavioural results, quality of life. Results: Fifty three patients were selected for the analysis. Complications occurred for 42. 6 % patients, including three gastric perforations. On average, the patients were seen by their surgeon 3. 5 times during 2002 but were not monitored under a systematic long-term programme. More than 58 % had no dietetic or specialised psychological monitoring after the operation. Forty three patients (81. 1 %) had progressed from the <b>morbid</b> or severe <b>obesity</b> stage to moderate obesity or better. Comorbidity improvement was observed in 79. 2 %of the cases. Feeding behaviour problems persisted in 86. 8 % of the patients. Quality of life was improved in 86. 8 % of the patients. Conclusion: The LAGB {{appears to be an}} effective technique in treating obesity but has no effect on feeding behaviour problems.

40|$|Craniopharyngiomas (CP) {{are partly}} cystic embryogenic malformations of the sellar and parasellar region. With an overall {{incidence}} of 0. 5 to 2. 0 new cases / million population / year, approximately 30 to 50 % {{of all cases}} represent childhood CP. Typical manifestations at diagnosis are headache, visual impairment, polyuria/polydypsia, growth retardation, and significant weight gain. Therapy of choice in patients with favorable tumor localization is complete resection with the intention to maintain optical nerve and hypothalamic-pituitary functions. In patients with unfavorable tumor localization (hypothalamic involvement), a limited resection followed by local irradiation is recommended. The overall survival rates are high (92 %). Recurrences after complete resection and progressions of residual tumor after incomplete resection are frequent post-surgical events. Accordingly, the appropriate time point of irradiation after incomplete resection is currently under investigation in a randomized multinational trial (KRANIOPHARYNGEOM 2007). Quality of life is substantially reduced in approximately 50 % of long-term survivors due to sequelae, notably <b>morbid</b> hypothalamic <b>obesity.</b> Both, childhood CP and adult onset CP should be recognized as chronic diseases requiring constant monitoring of the consequences and appropriate medical resources for treatment {{in order to provide}} optimal quality of survival for patients...|$|R

In the 8 to 10 day postoperative period both the breath and fecal 14 C content were highly elevated, indicating malabsorption and normal bacterial activity. Five to 8 months postoperatively both the breath and fecal 14 C content showed only moderate elevation, indicating adaptation. It is suggested that the 14 C-GCA test is useful in evaluating the adequacy of small bowel bypass procedures and also in following the adaptive response after the bypass. A significant increase in the breath and fecal 14 C soon after surgery followed by rapid decrease suggests an adequate bypass and unusually fast adaptation.
