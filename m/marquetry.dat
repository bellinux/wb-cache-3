5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the <b>marquetry</b> floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The <b>marquetry</b> floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1878 he drew up {{the plans}} for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a {{district}} of Barcelona); Gaudí did not {{take part in the}} construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with <b>marquetry</b> of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in Vallfogona de Riucorb, where this celebrated 17th-century writer and friend of Lope de Vega was the parish priest. Gaudí's project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping and harvesting grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaudí's ideas were not carried out.|$|E

25|$|A {{stairwell}} in {{the northwest}} corner of the vestibule leads to the choir loft. It has <b>marquetry</b> panels with Hungarian folk art motifs below the balustrade. The church's basement has been remodeled into an auditorium with paneled walls and a dropped acoustic-tile ceiling. A door near the rear of the nave opens into the parsonage.|$|E
25|$|Precious {{materials}} were {{demanded by the}} Portuguese court from the very beginning; thus we find several types of ornamental stones: lapis lazuli, agate, antique green, alabaster, Carrara marble, amethyst, purple porphyry, green porphyry, French white-black, ancient breccia, diaspore, and Persian gold-yellow, {{to name just a}} few. Besides the various marbles and mosaics, gilt bronze was also used. An exception to this is the last step of the altar platform – <b>marquetry</b> of precious woods and ivory.|$|E
25|$|Decorations in Mamluk {{buildings}} {{concentrated on}} the most conspicuous areas of buildings: minarets, portals, windows, on the outside, and mihrab, qiblah wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fishscale motifs, joggled lintels or voussoirs, inscriptions, and muqarnas) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and {{include the use of}} marble <b>marquetry,</b> stucco, and glass mosaic).|$|E
25|$|The château is {{furnished}} by {{objects of}} times, styles and origins {{that are very}} different, from between the 15th and 19th centuries, and from Holland to Portugal. The most remarkable pieces of furniture are perhaps a large armoire from Strasbourg dating from 1700, or a Louis XIII cabinet with <b>marquetry</b> of jasmine flowers. But the most remarkable part is without any doubt {{the door of the}} vault in solid oak, which comes from the Château de Bury and dates from the French Renaissance. Entirely sculpted, one finds representations of the instruments of the Passion on one of the pilasters.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} areas of Greek thought {{maintained}} and enhanced by Islamic scholars, Western interest in polyhedra revived during the Italian Renaissance. Artists constructed skeletal polyhedra, depicting them from life {{as a part of}} their investigations into perspective. Several appear in <b>marquetry</b> panels of the period. Piero della Francesca gave the first written description of direct geometrical construction of such perspective views of polyhedra. Leonardo da Vinci made skeletal models of several polyhedra and drew illustrations of them for a book by Pacioli. A painting by an anonymous artist of Pacioli and a pupil depicts a glass rhombicuboctahedron half-filled with water.|$|E
25|$|Many {{prisoners at}} Norman Cross made {{artefacts}} such as toys, model ships and dominoes sets from carved wood or animal bone, and straw <b>marquetry.</b> Examples of the prisoners' craftwork {{were sold to}} visitors and passers by. Some highly skilled prisoners were commissioned by wealthy individuals, some of the prisoners becoming very rich in the process. Archdeacon William Strong, a regular visitor to the prison, notes in his diary of 23 October 1801 that he provided a piece of mahogany and paid a prisoner £1 15s 6d to build {{a model of the}} Block House and £2 2s for a straw picture of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|After the {{bankrupt}} Tunisia became an autonomous republic in 1957 and the then reigning Bey from the Husainid Dynasty had lost both his political influence and his substantial inherited personal wealth, the train set with its luxurious Belle Époque interiors of brocaded velvet armchairs, overhead antique-globed lighting, brass fittings, mahogany <b>marquetry</b> and panoramic windows was confiscated {{by the new}} government but due to its symbolical value stored in a depot and left to its destiny. After some thirty years in decay it was however restored by the Tunisian state and the SNCFT (La Société National de Chemins de Fer Tunisiens) and today the Red Lizard and the train line Metlaoui-Tozeur, {{often referred to as}} the North-African Orient Express, is again running and one of the country's greatest tourist attractions.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a set of}} {{beautiful}} inlaid doors, dated 1580 from Antwerp City Hall, attributed to Hans Vredeman de Vries. One of the finest pieces of continental furniture in the collection is the Rococo Augustus Rex Bureau Cabinet dated c1750 from Germany, with especially fine <b>marquetry</b> and ormolu mounts. One of the grandest pieces of 19th-century furniture is the highly elaborate French Cabinet dated 1861–1867 made by M. Fourdinois, made from ebony inlaid with box, lime, holly, pear, walnut and mahogany woods as well as marble with gilded carvings. Furniture designed by Ernest Gimson, Edward William Godwin, Charles Voysey, Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner are among the late 19th-century and early 20th-century examples in the collection. The work of modernists in the collection include Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames, and Giò Ponti.|$|E
25|$|In 1761–64, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown was {{commissioned}} to redesign and enlarge {{the house and}} landscape the park. Brown set {{the style of the}} present day building by retaining the Elizabethan stables, the Riding School, and the great gabled front to the house, which he doubled in depth and provided gabled wings {{at either end of the}} house, creating the Picture Gallery and State Rooms in the east wing and a library and new kitchens in the west wing. The Picture Gallery was designed as a triple cube and boasts a coffered plasterwork ceiling over a high cove stuccoed in scrolls, designed by Brown and carried out by Thomas Stocking of Bristol (1763–66). The Long Gallery contains Italian Old Masters, with a famous <b>marquetry</b> commode and matching pair of candlestands by John Cobb (1772) and four pier glasses designed by Robert Adam (1770).|$|E
25|$|The Soulages {{collection}} of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings {{was left to}} the museum in 1882, then valued at £250,000. One {{of the most important}} pieces in this collection is a <b>marquetry</b> commode by the ébéniste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert & Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticised at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon {{collection of}} French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.|$|E
500|$|The Blue Drawing Room is {{dominated}} by the elaborate painted ceiling depicting [...] "The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne" [...] (illustrated left). This room houses a plaster statuette of the Venus de' Medici and marks the 2nd Baronet's risqué devotion to that goddess of love. The room has walls of blue flock, applied in the 1850s and later renewed, bearing paintings from various Italian schools of the 17th century. The Red Drawing Room is lined in crimson silk and is furnished with <b>marquetry</b> commodes.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and {{it is fair to say}} that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary <b>marquetry.</b>|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of the Entrance Hall are the two {{principal}} Elizabethan rooms, the Drawing Room and the Stag Parlour. The Drawing Room is panelled with intersecting arches above which is a <b>marquetry</b> frieze. The ceiling has studded bands, strapwork cartouches and a broad frieze. Over the fireplace is a large stone overmantel, which is decorated with pairs of atlantes and caryatids framing the arms of ElizabethI. The stained glass in this room includes medieval glass that was moved from the original Lyme Hall to Disley Church and returned to Lyme in 1835. The Stag Parlour has a chimneypiece depicting an Elizabethan house and hunting scenes, and it includes the arms of JamesI. The other Elizabethan rooms in the house are the Stone Parlour on the ground floor, and the Long Gallery, which is {{on the top floor of}} the east range. The Long Gallery also has a chimneypiece with the arms of ElizabethI. The Grand Staircase dates from the remodelling by Leoni and it has a Baroque ceiling. The Saloon is on the first floor of the south range, behind the portico. Its ceiling is decorated in rococo style, and the room contains wooden carvings that have been attributed to Grinling Gibbons. [...] The Chapel, in the northeast corner of the ground floor, also contains detailed carvings.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was no such}} [...] "standard decoration" [...] for Italian virginals. Where {{there was}} an outer case, it was often this that was decorated, leaving the actual {{instrument}} plain (typically for Venetian virginals). Cases could be decorated with paintings of grotesques, classical scenes, or <b>marquetry,</b> but soundboards were rarely painted. Keytops could be of plain boxwood, or lavishly decorated (as was often the case in northern Italy) with ivory, ebony, mother-of-pearl or tortoiseshell among other materials.|$|E
2500|$|The Entrance Hall is {{in three}} bays. [...] It is {{decorated}} in neoclassical style with a marble floor, red porphyry Ionic columns and a geometric coffered, tunnel vaulted ceiling. [...] The furniture includes two late-17th-century Italian {{chests of drawers}} and a walnut chest dating from around 1730, and a 19th-century walnut table and chairs. On each side of a central niche are marble busts of the Duke of Wellington and William Pitt the Younger on columns. [...] The largest painting in the entrance hall is The Cheshire Hunt, 1839 by Henry Calvert. [...] To {{the west of the}} entrance hall is the Card Room (where calling cards were left - not for playing cards, as in other Card Rooms). This room has a neoclassical cornice and fireplace. [...] A set of open arm chairs are English in the Adam style which date from around 1785. [...] Other furniture dates from the 19th century in Louis XVI <b>marquetry</b> style. In a showcase is a rare silver filigree Horn Book. [...] Paintings in the room include La Gouvernante by Chardin, The Head of an Old Man, 1639 by Abraham Bloemaert, A Farrier's by Philips Wouwerman, and Head of Nicodemus after Rogier van der Weyden.|$|E
2500|$|The Rembrandt Room Now {{called the}} Chandos Delta Dormitory. Immediately {{to the east}} of the Breakfast Parlour, {{originally}} dated 1748, the room was extended and redecorated in 1775. In a relatively plain room, the painting that {{used to be in the}} centre of the ceiling, Venus at her toilet by Vincenzo Valdrè was sold in 1922 along with the marble chimneypiece with its central relief of Hebe and Jupiter's Eagle. The room once contained eleven paintings attributed to Rembrandt although only three are considered so now, the rest being School of Rembrandt. All the paintings were sold in 1848. They included: Samson Threatening his Father-in-law, in 1989 this was sold by the estate of the late P Chrysler Jr; Bellona now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Self-Portrait as a Young man now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; Eleazor Swalmius now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp; A Young Negro Archer and (genuine Rembrandt) The Centurion Cornelius sold for £2,300 (the highest price any of the paintings sold in 1848 fetched) both now in the Wallace Collection. Also originally in this room and now in the Wallace Collection are the almost [...] high astronomical regulator clock by Michael Stollewerck formerly at the Palace of Versailles and a Boulle armoire. Also from this room was a German <b>marquetry</b> cabinet, later bought by Mayer Amschel de Rothschild for Mentmore Towers. It was in this room that Queen Victoria and her husband slept during their visit, redecorated for the occasion, including the purchase of the largest Persian carpet in the country, 25.5 by , this cost £200, but only fetched £55 in the 1848 sale. The 2nd Duke spent £5,300 on redecorating the house and on entertaining the royal couple for a visit that lasted a few days.|$|E
60|$|The couch {{occupied}} by the Countess lay in shadow; for all the lights in that long salon had been extinguished {{with the exception of}} a cluster of candles in a massive silver candle branch placed on a round <b>marquetry</b> table in the middle of the room--an island of light in the surrounding gloom.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{crash of}} music, a swishing of colored dresses, and then, as the {{orchestra}} ceased, we {{stood before the}} astonished assembly just as we had left the bush, in tattered fur wrappings and torn deerskin, with the stains of leagues of travel on our leggings, while I recollect that a creeper-spike on my heel made holes in the polished <b>marquetry.</b> All eyes were turned toward us.|$|E
6000|$|Embracing {{the inner}} {{length of the}} Southern short wall, and deeper by nearly treble the amount of columns than the other porticoes, is the main colonnade, called Al-Rauzah[FN#10] (the Garden), the adytum {{containing}} all that is venerable in the building. These four Riwaks, arched externally, are supported internally by pillars of different shape and material, varying from fine porphyry to dirty plaster. The Southern, where the sepulchre or cenotaph stands, is paved with handsome slabs of white marble and <b>marquetry</b> work, here and there covered with coarse matting, and above this by unclean carpets, well worn by faithful feet.[FN#11] ...|$|E
60|$|As regards petite {{industrie}} in Madeira, {{there is}} a considerable traffic in 'products of native industry,' sold to steamer-passengers. The list gives jewellery and <b>marquetry</b> or inlaid woodwork; feather-flowers, straw hats, lace and embroidery, the latter an important item; boots and shoes of unblackened leather; sweetmeats, especially guava-cheese; wax-fruits, soap-berry bracelets, and 'Job's tears;' costumes in wood and clay; basketry, and the well-known wicker chairs, tables, and sofas. The cooperage is admirable; I have nowhere seen better-made casks. The handsomest shops, as we might expect, are the apothecaries'; and, here, as elsewhere, they thrive by charging a sixpence for what cost them a halfpenny.|$|E
6000|$|The {{meetings}} of the convention were held in the ballroom of the Allen House. In an anteroom was {{the office of the}} chairman of the executive committee. He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that he got nothing done whatever. He sat at a <b>marquetry</b> table, in a room littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, [...] "Yes, yes, that's a fine idea; we'll do that," [...] and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching, [...] "Say, Mr. Chairman--say, Mr. Chairman!" [...] without penetrating his exhausted hearing.|$|E
60|$|If I {{could have}} {{foreseen}} how interminably difficult a task it {{would prove to}} tack these memoirs together, I am sure I should have profited a little more by the roarings of my fellow lions. As {{a matter of fact}} I used merely to watch them sipping their tea, and devouring their cake amid a languishing circle of admirers, and to wonder if they found the cage as tedious as I did. If they noticed me at all, they were usually polite enough; but--like the Beauties--inclined to be absent and restless in my company. So the odds were against me. I had one advantage over them, however, for when I was no longer a novelty, I could occasionally slip in, unperceived, behind an immense <b>marquetry</b> bureau. There in the dust I could sit at peace, comparing its back with its front, and could enjoy at leisure the conversation beyond.|$|E
60|$|She {{dared to}} tell friends who {{before the wedding}} inquired what she wanted, that checks were welcome, and need not be monogrammed. Even Aunt Emma {{had been willing to}} send a check, {{provided}} they were properly married in St. George's Church. Consequently their six rooms showed a remarkable absence of such usual wedding presents as prints of the smugly smiling and eupeptic Mona Lisa, three muffin-stands in three degrees of <b>marquetry,</b> three electroliers, four punch-bowls, three sets of almond-dishes, a pair of bird-carvers that did not carve, a bust of Dante in New Art marble, or a de luxe set of De Maupassant translated by a worthy lady with a French lexicon. Instead, they bought what they wanted--rather an impertinent thing to do, but, like most impertinences, thoroughly worth while. Their living-room was their own. Carl's bedroom was white and simple, though spotty with aviation medals and silver cups and monoplanes sketchily rendered in gold, and signed photographs of aviators. Ruth's bedroom was also plain and white and dull Japanese gray, a simple room with that simplicity of hand-embroidery, real lace, and fine linen appreciated by exclamatory women friends.|$|E
60|$|PASSING {{through a}} marble antechamber, Tancred was ushered into an {{apartment}} half saloon and half-library; the choicely-bound volumes, which were not too numerous, were ranged on shelves inlaid in the walls, so that they ornamented, without diminishing, the apartment. These walls were painted in encaustic, corresponding with the coved ceiling, which was richly adorned in the same fashion. A curtain of violet velvet, covering if necessary the large window, which looked upon a balcony full of flowers, and the umbrageous Park; an Axminster carpet, manufactured to harmonise both in colour and design {{with the rest of}} the chamber; a profusion of luxurious seats; a large table of ivory <b>marquetry,</b> bearing a carved silver bell which once belonged to a pope; a Naiad, whose golden urn served as an inkstand; some daggers that acted as paper cutters, and some French books just arrived; a group of beautiful vases recently released from an Egyptian tomb and ranged on a tripod of malachite: the portrait of a statesman, and the bust of an emperor, and a sparkling fire, were all circumstances which made the room both interesting and comfortable in which Sidonia welcomed Tancred and introduced him to a guest who had preceded him, Lord Henry Sydney.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they could}} escape they found {{themselves}} so convenient to the imperial palace that they judged best to discharge at once the obligation to visit it which must otherwise weigh upon them. They entered the court without opposition from the sentinel, and joined other strangers straggling instinctively toward a waiting-room {{in one corner of}} the building, where after they had increased to some thirty, a custodian took charge of them, and led them up a series of inclined plains of brick to the state apartments. In the antechamber they found a provision of immense felt over-shoes which they were expected to put on for their passage over the waxed <b>marquetry</b> of the halls. These roomy slippers were designed for the accommodation of the native boots; and upon the mixed company of foreigners the effect was in the last degree humiliating. The women's skirts some what hid their disgrace, but the men were openly put to shame, and they shuffled forward with their bodies at a convenient incline like a company of snow-shoers. In the depths of his own abasement March heard a female voice behind him sighing in American accents, [...] "To think I should be polishing up these imperial floors with my republican feet!" ...|$|E
60|$|The drawing-room, to the left, {{was dark}} and still and unsympathetic and expensive; a vista of brocade-covered French-gilt chairs and a <b>marquetry</b> table and a table of onyx top, on which was one book bound in ooze calf, and one vase; cream-colored heavy carpet and a crystal chandelier; fairly meretricious {{paintings}} of rocks, and thatched cottages, and ragged newsboys with faces like Daniel Webster, {{all of them in}} large gilt frames protected by shadow-boxes. In a corner was a cabinet of gilt and glass, filled with Dresden-china figurines and toy tables and a carven Swiss musical powder-box. The fireplace was of smooth, chilly white marble, with an ormolu clock on the mantelpiece, and a fire-screen painted with Watteau shepherds and shepherdesses, making silken unreal love and scandalously neglecting silky unreal sheep. By the hearth were shiny fire-irons which looked as though they had never been used. The whole room looked as though it had never been used--except during the formal calls of overdressed matrons with card-cases and prejudices. The one human piece of furniture in the room, a couch soft and slightly worn, on which lovers might have sat and small boys bounced, was trying to appear useless, too, under its row of stiff satin cushions with gold cords.... Well-dusted chairs on which no one wished to sit; expensive fireplace that never shone; prized pictures with less imagination than the engravings on a bond--that drawing-room had the soul of a banker with side-whiskers.|$|E
6000|$|As to {{the shape}} of the bookcases, and the furniture, and {{ornaments}} of the library, every amateur will please himself. Perhaps the satin-wood or mahogany tabernacles of rare books are best made after the model of what furniture-dealers indifferently call the [...] "Queen Anne" [...] or the [...] "Chippendale" [...] style. There is a pleasant quaintness in the carved architectural ornaments of the top, and the inlaid flowers of <b>marquetry</b> go well with the pretty florid editions of the last century, the books that were illustrated by Stothard and Gravelot. Ebony suits theological tomes very well, especially when they are bound in white vellum. As to furniture, people who can afford it will imitate the arrangements of Lucullus, in Mr. Hill Burton's charming volume [...] "The Book-hunter" [...] (Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1862).--"Everything is of perfect finish,--the mahogany-railed gallery, the tiny ladders, the broad winged lecterns, with leathern cushions on the edges to keep the wood from grazing the rich bindings, the books themselves, each shelf uniform with its facings, or rather backings, like well-dressed lines at a review." [...] The late Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, a famous bibliophile, invented a very nice library chair. It is most comfortable to sit on; and, as the top of the back is broad and flat, it {{can be used as a}} ladder of two high steps, when one wants to reach a book on a lofty shelf. A kind of square revolving bookcase, an American invention, manufactured by Messrs. Trubner, is useful to the working man of letters. Made in oak, stained green, it is not unsightly. As to ornaments, every man to his taste. You may have a [...] "pallid bust of Pallas" [...] above your classical collection, or fill the niches in a shrine of old French light literature, pastoral and comedy, with delicate shepherdesses in Chelsea china. On such matters a modest writer, like Mr. Jingle when Mr. Pickwick ordered dinner, [...] "will not presume to dictate." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had got safe {{into the}} drawing-room, {{and shut the}} door behind him, he was aware of a respite from alarms. The room was quite dismantled, uncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing cases and incongruous furniture; several great pier-glasses, in which he beheld himself at various angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures, framed and unframed, standing, with their faces to the wall; a fine Sheraton sideboard, a cabinet of <b>marquetry,</b> and a great old bed, with {{tapestry}} hangings. The windows opened to the floor; but by great good fortune {{the lower part of the}} shutters had been closed, and this concealed him from the neighbours. Here, then, Markheim drew in a packing case before the cabinet, and began to search among the keys. It was a long business, for there were many; and it was irksome, besides; for, after all, there might be nothing in the cabinet, and time was on the wing. But the closeness of the occupation sobered him. With the tail of his eye he saw the door--even glanced at it from time to time directly, like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate of his defences. But in truth he was at peace. The rain falling in the street sounded natural and pleasant. Presently, on the other side, the notes of a piano were wakened to the music of a hymn, and the voices of many children took up the air and words. How stately, how comfortable was the melody! How fresh the youthful voices! Markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he sorted out the keys; and his mind was thronged with answerable ideas and images; church-going children and the pealing of the high organ; children afield, bathers by the brookside, ramblers on the brambly common, kite- flyers in the windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another cadence of the hymn, back again to church, and the somnolence of summer Sundays, and the high genteel voice of the parson (which he smiled a little to recall) and the painted Jacobean tombs, and the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments in the chancel.|$|E
