40|$|Introduction: Brackets can be {{recycled}} by {{sending them to}} a commercial recycling company but it is time consuming and the bracket cannot be bonded in the same appointment. Hence in-house methods for recycling of brackets would be beneficial to both the orthodontist and the patient. Aim: In our study, we compared the shear bond strength of brackets after being recycled with erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (ER:YAG) laser, sandblasting and the thermal method. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 126 extracted premolars. The bonding procedure was performed with mandibular premolar metal and premolar ceramic brackets. Eighty-four teeth were subdivided into three groups for each <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling.</b> These groups were further subdivided into two groups of 14 teeth each for the types of brackets used. Prior to the initial bonding the bracket was also viewed under an environmental scanning electron microscope to examine the meshwork of the brackets and once again after the respective recycling methods had been performed. Results: We found that for stainless steel brackets, the sandblasting method was superior to the ER:YAG laser, as the recycled brackets showed a higher shear bond strength. For ceramic brackets the ER:YAG laser recycled group had the highest recycled shear bond strength therefore was the best <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> ceramic brackets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — {{with the}} {{increasing}} demand for utilization of energy resources, {{there has been a}} deflation in the availability of resources and there have been many <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> energy resources. It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not deplete all the energy resources leaving our future generations facing dangerous hazards. Our paper is one such attempt to reduce that burden. The method being employed by us is a new concept, which not only utilizes the principle of piezoelectricity to harvest energy but it also employs pyroelectric crystals and microcontroller to create a kind of feedback, with a battery getting charged automatically,till it becomes fully charged. With piezo electric crystals it is possible to harvest energy from vibrating structures. Pyroelectric effect occurs when change in temperature causes flow of charges. These two effects are used to charge the various components being used in this experiment while remaining energy is being used to charge the battery. Our model aims to create a cyclic flow of energy, thus ensuring very less or no wastage of energy. Index terms—Microcontroller, piezoelectricity, pyroelectric effect...|$|R

30|$|Composting is {{a process}} in which {{conversion}} of heterogeneous organic matter occurs through decomposition and humification. In recent years, interest in composting has increased because of the social demand for an environmentally friendly waste treatment technology and advent of organic farming. It is the most acceptable <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> organic matter and agriculture residues (Antil and Raj 2012). Although small amount of GHG emission occurs during the process of composting, substrate with low C:N ratio releases higher NH 3 and CH 4 emission (Jiang et al. 2011). Since composting is a microbial degradation process, C:N ratio is the most important factor to initiate the composting process. C:N ratio must be around 50 : 1 at the initiation stage for the composting process to proceed at a faster pace. As the C:N ratio (90 : 1) of paddy straw is very high, it is essential to bring down the C:N ratio by supplying an exogenous nitrogen source. Poultry droppings is a good supplement due to its high nitrogen content, and therefore amendment of paddy straw with poultry dropping is a desirable option to bring down the C:N ratio of paddy straw (Devi et al. 2010).|$|R
