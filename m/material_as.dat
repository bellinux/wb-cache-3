5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and <b>material.</b> <b>As</b> Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and the rivers flanked the Confederate forces at Columbus, and soon caused them to withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in the garage of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the <b>material</b> <b>as</b> a way to secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E
5|$|Carletonomys {{was found}} in {{association}} with remains of several other animals, including fishes, chelid turtles, frogs, birds, armadillos, and several rodents, including Reithrodon auritus, the coypu (Myocastor), both of which {{still live in the}} area, the extinct echimyid Dicolpomys, and unidentified caviids and octodontids. C.cailoi probably lived in a wetland habitat under relatively warm and moist climatic conditions. Although the limited material known permits few inferences as to the animal's natural history, it likely fed on hard plant <b>material,</b> <b>as</b> do related, morphologically similar extant species.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{immersion}} {{methods have}} been used for nondestructive evaluation of <b>material</b> properties <b>as</b> well as for B- or C-scan imaging of intemal microstructure and/or defects.

5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old <b>material</b> <b>as</b> they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose <b>material.</b> <b>As</b> ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|I. mantelli {{described}} by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1832, {{was based on}} the same <b>material</b> <b>as</b> I. anglicus and is an objective junior synonym of the latter. Several taxa, including the holotype of Dollodon and Mantellodon, but also the dubious hadrosauroid Trachodon cantabrigiensis the hypsilophodont Hypsilophodon, and Valdosaurus, were previously mis-assigned to I. mantelli.|$|E

5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new <b>material,</b> <b>as</b> well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material {{and the sound of}} the tunes with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.|$|E
5|$|In {{some unusual}} ionic compounds: fast ion conductors, and ionic glasses, {{one or more}} of the ionic {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the <b>material</b> <b>as</b> a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic <b>material</b> <b>as</b> they searched for pure gold, and {{it was used to}} fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E

5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw <b>material</b> <b>as</b> of the {{production}} costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting <b>material)</b> <b>as</b> {{can be seen in}} the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant <b>material.</b> <b>As</b> with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film Cheaters. Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators {{for the amount of}} time it requires students to spend on the <b>material,</b> <b>as</b> it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden Resource Guides rather than provide topics for students to research.|$|E
5|$|Persuasion {{was filmed}} {{during a period}} of {{popularity}} for Austen's works; it was one of six adaptations of her novels produced during the mid-1990s. The film originally aired on 16 April 1995, when it broadcast on the British television channel BBC Two. Sony Pictures Classics released the film in American cinemas on 27 September 1995, as Austen's increasing popularity became apparent to Hollywood. Persuasions cinematic release attracted the attention of film critics, and it received generally positive reviews, with many praising Root's performance. Film scholars have since observed significant changes from the source <b>material,</b> <b>as</b> well as class and gender themes.|$|E
