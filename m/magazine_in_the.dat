5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the <b>magazine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
