2500|$|In his memoirs, Holloway III {{complained that}} [...] "there {{has often been}} a tacit {{presumption}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a position to advance my career as I gained seniority in the Navy. On the contrary, as a retired officer he {{had little or no}} influence over his own future, much less mine." [...] As an example of this presumption, when President Richard M. Nixon approved Holloway III's nomination to succeed Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as chief of naval operations, Zumwalt believed that Nixon acquiesced mainly to avoid overruling the recommendation of his secretary of defense, but that, [...] "In addition, and I really think this was a factor, Mr. Nixon remembered Jimmy's father from his own period of naval service." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you're standing. I don't have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive." ...|$|E

60|$|I wrote briefly, {{telling the}} damp {{lady of the}} rectory (only at greater length) what I have told here.
