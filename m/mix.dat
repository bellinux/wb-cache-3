Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a mono <b>mix</b> was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) <b>mix</b> from this mono <b>mix,</b> instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic <b>mix,</b> rather than using the April 1967 mono <b>mix.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The concept {{appears in}} ergodic theory—the study of {{stochastic}} processes and measure-preserving dynamical systems. Several different definitions for <b>mixing</b> exist, including strong <b>mixing,</b> weak <b>mixing</b> and topological <b>mixing,</b> {{with the last}} not requiring a measure to be defined. Some of the different definitions of <b>mixing</b> can be arranged in a hierarchical order; thus, strong <b>mixing</b> implies weak <b>mixing.</b> Furthermore, weak <b>mixing</b> (and thus also strong <b>mixing)</b> implies ergodicity: that is, every system that is weakly <b>mixing</b> is also ergodic (and so one says that <b>mixing</b> is a [...] "stronger" [...] notion than ergodicity).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the effect of {{vibrating}} <b>mixing</b> technology in industrial production of concrete, the influence of vibrating <b>mixing</b> and common forced <b>mixing</b> on the <b>mixing</b> quality and efficiency were comparatively investigated by field tests of concrete <b>mixing</b> plant. The vibrating <b>mixing</b> scheme was achieved by adopting <b>mixing</b> shaft and blades as vibrating source based on conventional twin-shaft mixer. The field tests included <b>mixing</b> time test and reducing cement test. The experimental results show that under different <b>mixing</b> time, the freshly <b>mixed</b> concrete by both <b>mixing</b> methods have similar uniformity but the hardened concrete have distinctive compression strength; comparing with common forced <b>mixing,</b> vibrating <b>mixing</b> makes the materials in vibrating status to destroy their sticky connection and distribute cement particles, so both 7 d and 28 d compression strength are significantly improved and the <b>mixing</b> time is reduced; with the cement reduction, the compression strength of concrete by both <b>mixing</b> methods decrease, but comparing with common forced <b>mixing,</b> vibrating <b>mixing</b> can save cement under the condition of ensuring necessary concrete strength due to its improved cement utilization...|$|R

In {{order to obtain}} the maximum turbidity and humic acid removal efficiency of Kaolin and humic acid simulated wastewater, the optimum coagulation conditions was investigated with the factors of <b>mixing</b> speed and time. Furthermore, <b>mixing</b> speed and time including parameters affecting the coagulation performance such as rapid <b>mixing</b> speed, rapid <b>mixing</b> time, slow <b>mixing</b> speed and slow <b>mixing</b> time using single factor and orthogonal array L 9 (34) analysis were examined.

However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final <b>Mix</b> version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the staff would think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final <b>Mix</b> would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final <b>Mix</b> releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final <b>Mix</b> includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final <b>Mix</b> featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final <b>Mix</b> topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011.

40|$|A <b>mixed</b> graph is a graph with {{edges and}} arcs, {{which can be}} {{considered}} as a hybrid of an undirected graph and a directed graph. In this paper we define the <b>mixed</b> adjacency matrix and the <b>mixed</b> energy of a <b>mixed</b> graph. The <b>mixed</b> adjacency matrix generalizes both the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph and the skew-adjacency matrix of a digraph. Then we compute the characteristic polynomial of the <b>mixed</b> adjacency matrix of a <b>mixed</b> graph and deduce some basic results from it.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a numerical study on <b>mixing</b> in a barrier embedded micromixer {{with an emphasis}} on the effect of periodic and aperiodic sequences of <b>mixing</b> protocols on <b>mixing</b> performance. A mapping method was employed to investigate <b>mixing</b> in various sequences, enabling us to qualitatively observe the progress of <b>mixing</b> and also to quantify both the rate and the final state of <b>mixing.</b> First, we introduce the design concept of the four <b>mixing</b> protocols and the route to achieve chaotic <b>mixing</b> of the mixer. Then, several periodic sequences consisting of the four <b>mixing</b> protocols are used to investigate the <b>mixing</b> performance depending on the sequence. Chaotic <b>mixing</b> was observed, but with different <b>mixing</b> rates and different final <b>mixing</b> states significantly influenced by the specific sequence of <b>mixing</b> protocols and inertia. As for the effect of inertia, the higher the Reynolds number the larger the rotational motion of the fluid leading to faster <b>mixing.</b> We found that a sequence showing the best <b>mixing</b> performance at a certain Reynolds number is not always superior to other sequences in a different Reynolds number regime. A properly chosen aperiodic sequence results in faster and more uniform <b>mixing</b> than periodic sequence...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompressed Air Foam System {{is a kind}} of {{new high}} {{efficiency}} firefighting systems. It produces high quality foams by injecting compressed air into foam solution.

Stability of foams was used as criteria to evaluate the gas-liquid <b>mixing</b> effect. Gas-liquid <b>mixing</b> modus, gas-liquid <b>mixing</b> area and turbulence enhancer were three factors determined by <b>mixing</b> chamber structure.
