40|$|AbstractSince the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> {{information}} and their mutual relationship {{are complex and}} diverse, the clear and accurate description and modeling of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information is a challenge in related study of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> Considering {{the diversity of the}} process data, a four-layer framework for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information modeling based on metamodel is proposed. A 4 -tuple <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information metamodel is specified and the concepts and relationships of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information are represented by UML. Following the four-layer hierarchical modeling procedures in the framework, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information can be modeled from metamodel to model in consistence with their data relationships and representations. An instance of information model regarding to machining process is developed for verification.

40|$|Data {{analysis}} and processing of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> is significant {{to ensure the}} stable production safety, maintain quality stabilization, and optimize production profit. Practical <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> often has complex characteristics, such as multimode, nonlinearity, etc. Mode division can divide <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> into multiple modes and is useful for subsequent process monitoring and scheduling optimizing. In this paper, density peaks clustering (DPC) based on multiple distance measures is used for mode division in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> Multiple distance measures for computing the local density and minimum distance between the point and any other point with higher density in DPC are compared and analyzed. To illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} clustering method for mode division in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> experiments are developed based on penicillin fermentation process and practical foods industrial production process.

40|$|Information {{integration}} and interoperability among different design and manufacturing application software systems {{are important in}} smart manufacturing implementation and product life cycle management. Information models are foundational and critical to the specification of common terms, interfaces, and software architectures for information interoperability. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> {{is one of the}} key processes in a product life cycle. This paper presents a methodology of using the metamodels as the modeling basis in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information modeling. A <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information metamodel (MPIMM), which consists of object classes, relationship classes, and relationships, defines the information and relationships of processes, operations, resources used, and product/part manufactured of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> planning. The MPIMM is built by unified modeling language (UML) while the semantics of the process elements and their attributes are specified referencing the process specification language. A four-layer framework is proposed to construct <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information model (MPIM) following the rules of metamodeling, and including meta-metamodeling, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> information metamodeling, and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> domain information modeling; thus, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> plan data can be represented. The UML profile extension mechanism realized by defining Stereotype, TaggedValue, and Constraint is used in extending MPIMM to MPIM. A case study of applying MPIM in the product life cycle data management system for port hoisting equipment manufacturing is provided to demonstrate and verify the modeling capability and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes,</b> products that once were kosher may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E

30|$|The term Cp {{denotes the}} process {{potential}} capability index, and similarly, the termCpk denotes the process performance capability index.

40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and physical}} {{properties of the}} chocolate mass depend on the ingredient composition {{as well as the}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> For the purpose of this work, a milk chocolate mass of identical composition and raw materials was manufactured by using the two different manufacturing processes: a standard <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> (SM) in five-roller mills including conching, and an unconventional <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> in a ball mill (R 1). The quality of both milk chocolate masses was examined by the comparison of thermal (differential scanning calorimetry analysis), textural properties (texture analysis), and the content of hard triglycerides (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The main goal of this work was to determine whether chocolate can be produced in a ball mill, using the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> which results in significant savings, without causing drastic changes to the chocolate physical properties. The new <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> rationalises the standard method by combining two phases, namely conching, and refining into a single one.
