Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al.

In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{regulation to}} reduce bycatch and discarding of finfish {{in the southeastern}} region is a gear modification that excludes finfish from shrimp trawls. This regulation is analyzed using a simple theoretical model of a <b>multispecies</b> <b>fishery</b> whose bycatch is harvested in a directed fishery consisting of commercial and recreational fishermen. The costless reduction in bycatch fishing mortality imposed on the <b>multispecies</b> <b>fishery</b> does not result in an increased stock size for the bycatch fish species or {{a substantial increase in}} its level of harvest. Instead, the fish stock is reallocated from the <b>multispecies</b> <b>fishery</b> to the fishery directed at the bycatch species causing fishing effort to expand in the bycatch species fishery that drives the stock size down to the previously existing equilibrium level. Recreational harvest and effort levels remain unchanged since the model is linear in effort and the commercial fishery is given access to the fishery first.

40|$|The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) manages New England’s {{northeast}} <b>multispecies</b> <b>fishery</b> {{with effort}} controls including gear restrictions, seasonal and permanent closures, trip and daily possession limits, and days-at-sea (DAS). The fishery operates on a soft or “target” {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) rather than a hard catch limit. Target TACs lack a closure provision, and do not require overages to be deducted from the following year’s recommended TAC. New England routinely exceeds target catch levels for multiple stocks, threatening rebuilding objectives and leading to more restrictive effort controls. Hard catch limits would provide greater control over total fishing mortality, ensuring that managers and fishermen are held accountable to objectives of the multispecies management plan and that rebuilding plans are successful. They would also eliminate the economic inefficiencies generated by input controls and provide fishermen with greater economic opportunities during the rebuilding process. Seven sub-programs within the northeast <b>multispecies</b> <b>fishery</b> are currently managed under hard catch limits including the Georges Bank hook and fixed gear sectors, the U.

40|$|When {{regulations}} are species specific but the species {{are part of}} a multispecies fishery, studies show that harvest rates are correlated such that net revenues attributed to each species are also correlated. This correlation suggests that portfolio theory is well suited for <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries</b> that exhibit joint productive characteristics. This paper uses a portfolio approach to model the behavior of fishermen faced with multiple targeting options in a random harvest fishery. The approach draws from the expected utility hypothesis and financial portfolio theory to predict optimal targeting strategies. The methodology is applied to the pelagic longline fleet operating in the U. S. Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. The model provides evidence that area closures aimed at reducing juvenile swordfish mortality will be more effective in certain regions. Efficient risk-return frontiers are also generated for use in predicting targeting behavior in lieu of a closure. fisheries economics, fisheries management, highly migratory species, <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries,</b> portfolio theory, swordfish, targeting strategies, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 22, G 11, D 81, C 61,...|$|E

40|$|PresentationThe Australian Harvest Strategy Policy {{requires}} that maximum economic yield (MEY) be the target in all Commonwealth managed fisheries. For <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries,</b> unlike single species fisheries, the optimal yield is not {{independent of the}} optimal yield of the companion species (i. e. those species with which it is caught). In fisheries with many species, the cost of undertaking assessments of all species is prohibitive and {{may be more than}} the actual rent generated. As a result, the species have a varying level of information, and targets are often defined primarily for those species with good information with others being given “precautionary” targets that may not be consistent with maximising economic returns from the fishery. In our study, we use simulation/optimisation modelling approaches to estimate rules of thumb for improving catch targets in <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries</b> when full stock assessment are unavailable. A stochastic multispecies bioeconomic model is developed and used to assess target reference points (expressed in terms of BMEY/BMSY) under a wide range of biological and economic conditions.

40|$|Biological {{diversity}} {{is known to}} play an important role in generating and maintaining ecosystem productivity and other functions, and has consequently become a central focus of many efforts to preserve ecosystem services. Theoretical parallels suggest the diversity of fishing fleets may have a similarly important role in determining the productivity and ecological impacts of fisheries, but this possibility has rarely been explored. Here I present theoretical analyses showing that the diversity of métiers - combinations of technology, target species, and fishing grounds - and technical efficiencies in a fishing fleet have important impacts on the productivity, profitability, and ecological impacts of fisheries, particularly mixed-stock or <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Diversification of métiers can increase yields and reduce threats to weak stocks in both managed and unmanaged <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Diversification of technical efficiencies creates opportunities for larger profits in managed fisheries, but often decreases yields and worsens impacts on weak stocks in unmanaged fisheries.

40|$|<b>Multispecies</b> <b>fisheries</b> pose a {{considerable}} management difficulty {{with respect to}} quota allocation between species. Externalities of direct control over the harvest may include, among others, creation of unbalanced predator‐prey relationships in the environment. That, in turn, may affect the individual economic incentives of fishing vessels. Combining economic and ecological factors in one model has multiple advantages, whereas there have been little attempts to coordinate setting the total allowable catches in <b>multispecies</b> <b>fisheries,</b> particularly {{in the context of}} individual decision‐making process. The objective {{of this article is to}} develop a methodological framework for multispecies modeling with integrated ecological and economic realism suitable to evaluate the long term implications of the imposed regulations that can be used for better policy guidance. An empirical application is provided for the central Baltic Sea with its interacting fish community dominated by three species: cod, herring and sprat. The developed model includes three separate, dynamically updating, age‐structured submodels for each species, which are linked through predation. The harvest component is associated with the fishing vessels that optimize individual behavior subject to regulations, owned capital and individual technical efficiency derived with the use of a multiproduct distance function. The findings present a clear picture of asymmetries between vessels with respect to harvest process and reveal the rational harvest strategy that is accommodated in the multispecies simulation model...|$|E
