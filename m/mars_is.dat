5|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{observations}} of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> {{marked by the}} oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.|$|E
50|$|Clan <b>Mar</b> <b>is</b> a Scottish clan. It is also officially {{known as}} the Tribe of Mar. The chiefs of the Clan <b>Mar</b> <b>were</b> the {{original}} Earls of Mar, although this title later went via an heiress to the Douglases in the late fourteenth century, {{and then to the}} Stewarts before going to the Erskines. The current chief of Clan <b>Mar</b> <b>is</b> Margaret of <b>Mar,</b> Countess.|$|R
40|$|Matrix Attachment Regions (<b>MARs)</b> <b>are</b> DNA {{elements}} that are thought to influence gene expression by anchoring active chromatin domains to the nuclear matrix. When flanking a construct in transgenic plants, <b>MARs</b> could <b>be</b> useful for enhancing transgene expression. Naturally occurring MARs {{have a number of}} sequence features and DNA elements in common, and using different subsets of these sequence elements, three independent synthetic <b>MARs</b> <b>were</b> created. Although short, these <b>MARs</b> <b>were</b> able to bind nuclear scaffold preparations with an affinity equal to or greater than naturally occurring plant MARs. One synthetic <b>MAR</b> <b>was</b> extensively tested for its effect on transgene expression, using different MAR orientations, plant promoters, transformation methods and plant species. This <b>MAR</b> <b>was</b> able to increase average transgene expression and produced integration patterns of lower complexity. These data show the potential of making well defined synthetic MARs and using them to improve transgene expression...|$|R

5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E

5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from the Sun is roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and {{carbonaceous}} chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Artifact is a 2012 American {{documentary}} film. It {{was directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, and produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook. Artifact chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Leto's rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI, which filed a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit against them in 2008, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute. Thirty Seconds to <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> shown working with producer Flood to create the 2009 album This Is War, meeting with lawyers between recording sessions.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

40|$|Parallel superposition. Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{nonlinear}} viscoelasticity of polymer melts at high shear rate, multi-function and all-electric rheometer (<b>MAR)</b> <b>was</b> designed by the authors. Development of temperature control system of <b>MAR</b> <b>is</b> important because rheological behavior of polymer melts is affected by temperature significantly. The design principle of the temperature control system of <b>MAR</b> <b>was</b> studied. According to the temperature upper limit the barrel need to reach, and the power the heating system can offer to maintain the temperature, the suitable type of heating system was determined. Considering the requirement of heater and the measurement error, the suitable type of temperature transducer was determined. The measured values of temperature were compared with the set values of them to evaluate the temperature control error of MAR. The {{results show that the}} temperature fluctuation is smaller than ± 0. 4 ℃ in 3. 5 minute. Therefore, the temperature control error of <b>MAR</b> <b>is</b> small enough for rheological test. And the temperature control stability of <b>MAR</b> <b>is</b> very well...|$|R

5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of}} the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta {{estimated}} the angular size of Mars as 2arc-minutes (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000km (1,296,600yojana, where one yojana {{is equivalent to}} eightkm in the Surya Siddhanta). From this the diameter of <b>Mars</b> <b>is</b> deduced to be 6,070km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may {{have been influenced by}} the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.|$|E
