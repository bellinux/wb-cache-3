40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to prepare tint ladders of each colorant consisting of five or more concentrations {{in order to develop}} a colorant database for instrumental-based color matching, characterization of optical properties of a coloration system, and pigment mapping. For two-constant Kubelka-Munk theory, the unit absorption and scattering coefficients for each colorant can be solved by the linear-least-squares method using all the samples in the tint ladder. The objective of this research was to find the minimum number of samples in order to characterize each colorant. For the purpose of pigment identification, a pure pigment (<b>masstone)</b> and a mixture sample of unknown concentration with white paint were sufficient to describe each pigment qualitatively. On the other hand, pigment mapping, which resolves not only colorant constituents but also their concentrations, required a <b>masstone</b> and a mixture sample of known concentration, preferably 40 % to 60 % with white paint, to quantitatively characterize each colorant. For either case, only two samples were needed, which greatly simplified the process to develop a colorant database. This was tested using artist acrylic and oil paints...|$|E
30|$|The vibrancy of the {{contrasting}} {{colors in the}} Haku Maki prints {{and the potential for}} lengthy or repeated exhibition raised concerns over the stability of the inks to light. Chrome based pigments are known to darken upon exposure to light, and the lightfastness of aniline black is variously reported as either good or questionable. Herbst and Hunger’s authoritative industrial textbook describes the lightfastness of aniline black as good in the <b>masstone,</b> but weaker when admixed with titanium white [12]. However, several artists’ websites and watercolor manuals list the pigment in commercial paints as being of only moderate lightfastness or fugitive unless mixed with carbon black [19, 20]. Molybdate orange in particular is considered to have only modest lightfastness [18 – 20].|$|E
