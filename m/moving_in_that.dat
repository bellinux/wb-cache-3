500|$|Toward {{the last}} years of his reign Władysław IV sought to enhance his {{position}} and assure his son's succession by waging a war on the Ottoman Empire, for which he prepared, despite the lack of nobility support. To secure this end the King worked on forming an alliance with the Cossacks, whom he encouraged to improve their military readiness and intended to use against the Turks, <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction of cooperation further than his predecessors. The war never took place, and the King had to explain his offensive war designs during the [...] "inquisition" [...] sejm of 1646. Władysław's son Zygmunt Kazimierz died in 1647, and the King, weakened, resigned and disappointed, in 1648.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reason why}} the object does not fall down when {{subjected}} to only downward forces is a simple one. [...] Think about what keeps an object up after it is thrown. [...] Once an object is thrown into the air, there is only the downward force of earth’s gravity that acts on the object. [...] That {{does not mean that}} once an object is thrown in the air, it will fall instantly. [...] What keeps that object up in the air is its velocity. [...] The first of Newton's laws of motion states that an object’s inertia keeps it in motion, and since the object in the air has a velocity, it will tend to keep <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{inhalation}} at rest {{is primarily}} due to the contraction of the diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig.7) increasing {{the volume of the}} thoracic cavity. The contracting diaphragm [...] pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig.7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred as [...] "abdominal breathing", although it is, in fact, [...] "diaphragmatic breathing", which is not visible {{on the outside of the}} body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles only during forceful exhalation (see Fig.8, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} about {{tracking}} people in real-time {{as they move}} through the non-overlapping fields of view of multiple video cameras. The paper builds upon existing methods for tracking <b>moving</b> objects <b>in</b> a single camera. The key extension {{is the use of}} a stochastic transition matrix to describe people’s observed patterns of motion both within and between fields of view. The parameters of the model for a particular environment are learnt simply by observing a person <b>moving</b> about <b>in</b> <b>that</b> environment. No knowledge of the environment or the configuration of the cameras is required. ...|$|R
