5|$|In December, {{the second}} Block I flight AS-205 was {{canceled}} as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1. McDivitt's crew was now promoted to prime {{crew of the}} Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 launch vehicle would be used in place of AS-207. A third manned mission was planned to launch the CSM and LM together on a Saturn V (AS-503) to an elliptical <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (MEO), to be crewed by Frank Borman, Michael Collins and William Anders. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart had started their training for AS-258 in CM-101 at the NAA plant in Downey, California, when the Apollo 1 accident occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{commonly}} used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are Low Earth orbit (LEO), <b>Medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (MEO) and High Earth orbit (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km. <b>Medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786km. High Earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786km.|$|E
25|$|Higher orbits include <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (MEO), {{sometimes}} called {{intermediate circular orbit}} (ICO), and further above, geostationary orbit (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.|$|E

25|$|McDivitt's {{crew and}} mission were kept {{as the first}} manned {{development}} LM flight (D mission); this was planned to be Apollo 8 in December 1968, now using a single Saturn V launch vehicle instead of two separate Saturn IB launches.

500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E

The most important systems are M-Star, Celestri, and SkyBridge. In this paper the probability of visibility is presented for these new planned mobile satellite systems for low <b>earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (LEO). The performance of a satellite system is primarily dependent on the probability of visibility and the elevation limit.

40|$|M. Ing. The {{increase}} of multimedia and broadband communications {{in recent years}} has brought about the creation and implementation of synchronousdigital hierarchy (SDH) in the terrestrial network. The implementation of SDH in the satellite sector is a natural extension to improve the current available networks. It will drastically increase the flexibility and usability of the current under-utilized satellite sector. Unfortunately, SDH has still not been implemented in the satellite sector due to certain inherent synchronization problems of SDH and satellites. This thesis investigates some of these synchronization problems. A simulation tool was created that makes an accurate assessment of SDH synchronization in the satellite sector. The tool was used to study SDH links over goestationary (GEO), <b>medium</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> (MEO) and low <b>earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> (LEO) satellites. Various changeable SDH parameters were investigated to determine their influences. Parameters like the bit rate and elastic store length or hysteresis lengths were considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} a robust optimization based method to design orbits {{on which the}} sensory perception of the desired physical quantities are maximized. It also demon-strates how to incorporate various constraints imposed by many spacecraft missions such as collision avoidance, co-orbital con-figuration, altitude and frozen orbit constraints along with Sun-Synchronous orbit. The paper specifically investigates designing orbits for constrained visual sensor planning applications as the case study. For this purpose, the key elements to form an image in such vision systems are considered and effective factors {{are taken into account}} to define a metric for perception quality. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for several scenarios on low and <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> as well as a challenging Space-Based Space Surveillance program application...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for minimum-time reconfiguration of satellite formations is proposed considering the perturbation forces as control variables. Planning appropriate attitude maneuvers for each satellite, the atmospheric drag {{and of the}} solar radiation pressure are properly controlled, and the formation is given the appropriate inputs to achieve the imposed reconfiguration. Limits and advantages of the presented maneuvers are examined considering low <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits,</b> and geostationary orbits. The recent inverse dynamics particle swarm optimization is involved; {{the integration of the}} attitude dynamics is avoided, thus reducing the computational effort, and satisfied attitude constraints at the initial and final time instants are guaranteed. B-spline curves approximate the attitude kinematics, variable time mesh points are introduced, and adaptive decreasing tolerances are considered for the imposed constraints. The evolution of the configuration is simulated with a high-fidelity orbital simulator considering all the perturbations that can affect the maneuver. Two test cases are taken into account, one involving a circular formation reconfiguration and the other an along-track reconfiguration...|$|R

The connection between the probability of visibility, the elevation constraint and the service radius is shown for the named systems without ISLs (Globalstar, Odyssey, ICO). I.
