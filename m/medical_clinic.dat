40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare quality of care for patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in specialized vs. general clinics. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating compliance with a set of STD-related process of care quality indicators for adult patients seen in six Los Angeles County clinics (two STD specialized clinics and four general <b>medical</b> <b>clinics).</b> RESULTS: Thirty-two quality indicators were selected using a modified Delphi process. From March 1, 1996, to June 31, 1996, there were 205 STD-related visits to the two specialized STD clinics and 373 STD-related visits to the four general <b>medical</b> <b>clinics.</b> For patients with "classic" STDs (those for which sexual contact is the primary means of transmission), STD clinics achieved greater compliance than general <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> on 14 quality indicators, while general <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> achieved greater compliance on 4 indicators. CONCLUSION: STD clinics provide better overall STD care than general <b>medical</b> <b>clinics.</b> Possible explanations include differences in clinician experience with STD patients and greater use of standardized protocol sheets...|$|R

5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a <b>medical</b> <b>clinic</b> to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E

Medications and medical tools were donated by dozens of organizations including Pfizer, which donated the majority of the medications used. During its three months of operation, the clinic had over 5,500 documented patient encounters.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the central campus area, along Columbia Road, sits the School of Medicine complex. The main School of Medicine {{building}} is the remodeled St. Michael's Hospital building which was built in 1951. Other buildings in the medical school complex include the Biomedical Research Center and the Neuroscience Research Facility. Further north sits an area that is called University Village. This land sat virtually empty for decades, but has recently been developed for UND, commercial, and residential purposes. University Village is anchored by the $100 million Ralph Engelstad Arena, which is used by the men's and women's hockey teams. University Village is also home to the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center, the new Student Wellness Center, university apartments, the UND bookstore, a <b>medical</b> <b>clinic,</b> and several residential and commercial properties.|$|E
5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a <b>medical</b> <b>clinic,</b> a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E

The spatial analysis of health planning and distribution of health services {{is one of the}} approaches in Health Geography. Spatial analyses in Health Geography studies have revealed the inadequacies and inequalities in various geographies. The local <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> are significant establishments because the local patients prefer them to go first when they are ill. Kutahya is a province that is located in the Aegean Region in Turkey. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the distribution of the local <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> and the structure of population in Kutahya. The data that was provided by the province health directorates in 2008 were used in this study. Also Turkey Statistical Institute (TUIK) data and the Ministry of Agriculture data were used. The geographical distribution and population structure of the local <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> were tried to be determined. It is significant for that to present the distribution of local <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> and distribution of medical staffs in Kutahya. At the end of the study, it was understood that some local <b>medical</b> <b>clinics</b> need some <b>medical</b> staffs.

5|$|As {{the storm}} approached, {{residents}} of low-lying areas were advised to seek shelter. According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones. Additionally, district authorities collected food, water, and other essential emergency supplies. Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two trawlers to collide, resulting in 18fatalities; {{their bodies were}} later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional trawlers were reported missing. Nine fishing trawlers sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66fishermen accounted for. Initially, as many as 600were estimated to have been missing, though 250people swam back to Digha, where most of them received treatment at either a <b>medical</b> <b>clinic</b> or a hospital. According to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, 111people were still missing offshore West Bengal by late on November12. Forty-nine fatalities were confirmed offshore India, while two deaths occurred inland in West Bengal. Later, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters raised the death toll to 124.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} Austria in December 2014, with {{production}} {{taking in the}} area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee, before concluding in February 2015. Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private <b>medical</b> <b>clinic</b> in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{returned}} to Germany {{after the operation}} was complete. Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, {{as well as the}} German Engineering School. The brigade also set up marksman competitions with German units, to give US soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th over the years that it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a <b>medical</b> <b>clinic.</b> Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.|$|E
