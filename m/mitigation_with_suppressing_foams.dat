40|$|The {{characterisation}} of foaming {{in plant}} cell cultures was investigated using Monnda citnfoha, {{as a test}} organism Suspensions were cultivated in 250 ml shake flasks, {{over the course of}} 21 day batch growth cycles, and were characterised in terms of biomass concentration, conductivity, morphology, pH and metabolite production (extracellular proteins and extracellular polysaccharides (ECP)). The Theological and surface tension profiles of the cell-free broths were assessed, with a view to understanding the influence o f these characteristics on foaming behaviour. A bubble column, to investigate the foaming potential of cell-free broths, was designed and validated. A preliminary study was performed, to monitor the ability of a silicone antifoam to <b>suppress</b> <b>foaming</b> and to investigate its influence on culture growth and productivity. Image analysis-based morphological studies showed that the distributions of chains and cells m these suspensions are log-normal. A linear relationship was identified between conductivity and biomass concentration, expressed in terms of fresh weight and cell number, however, this relationship was only apparent up to the stationary phase, for dry weight measurements Metabolite production was strongly growth-associated. The viscosity of the broth was found to increase with culture age and was successfully correlated with ECP production Surface tension was observed to reach a minimum during {{the early stages of the}} growth cycle and to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the growth cycle. These variations were attributed to extracellular proteins. Foammess characterisation studies in both cell-free broths and in model systems (using BSA and xanthan gum) revealed that foammess was greatly influenced by proteins, polysaccharides and nature of the suspending fluid. Foammess in medium-based solutions was significantly greater than in comparable aqueous-based solutions. The antifoam employed was compatible with this suspension culture, when cultivated in shake flasks and was effective in <b>suppressing</b> <b>foam</b> formation during foaming experiments in the bubble column...|$|R
40|$|Involvement of MCP- 1 and M-CSF in hypercholesterolemia-induced glomerular foam cell {{formation}} in ExHC ratsBackgroundAn increase in glomerular macrophages (MØ) {{is considered a}} potential effector mechanism by which hyper-cholesterolemia exacerbates glomerular injury. To investigate the mechanism underlying recruitment of MØ into glomeruli, the expression of glomerular monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) mRNA were examined using a lipid-induced glomer-ular injury rat model. MethodsEight-week-old male ExHC rats, a strain susceptible to hyperlipidemia, were divided into the following 4 groups: a control group (C), a high cholesterol diet group (HH), a high cholesterol diet/standard diet group (HN), which were fed a high cholesterol diet for the first 4 weeks and a standard diet for the following 4 weeks, and a probucol-treatment group (PT). Both MCP- 1 and M-CSF mRNA expression in glomeruli were analyzed using the RT-PCR method. An additional experimental group (M) fed a high cholesterol diet was administered M-CSF daily for 4 weeks. ResultsThe expression of MCP- 1 mRNA in glomeruli increased accompanied by an increased total serum cholesterol level in HH and HN. However, M-CSF mRNA expression was significantly suppressed at 1 or 2 weeks and gradually increased to almost basal levels. In the PT group, MCP- 1 mRNA expression was suppressed. The early suppression of M-CSF mRNA expression was inhibited in PT. Renal histology showed a sig-nificant increase in foam cells in glomeruli in HH and HN rats at 4 weeks. HH rats showed increased and expanded foam cells at 8 weeks. In HN rats, however, foam cells decreased significantly after the transfer to a standard diet from a high cholesterol diet. The MCP- 1 mRNA expression was suppressed after the transfer. In the PT group, foam cell formation was also <b>suppressed.</b> <b>Foam</b> cells were identified as MØ. M-CSF-treatment significantly <b>suppressed</b> <b>foam</b> cell {{formation in}} glo-meruli {{when compared with the}} untreated group levels. ConclusionThese findings suggest that hypercholesterol-emia stimulated the expression of MCP- 1 in glomeruli and attracted the MØ into glomeruli. They also suggest that the reduction of hypercholesterolemia after the change in diet or treatment <b>with</b> probucol <b>suppressed</b> glomerular injury by suppressing the glomerular MCP- 1 expression. M-CSF may suppress the recruitment of MØ into glomeruli and foam cell formation at an early stage of hypercholesterolemia-induced glomerular injury...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAkt, a serine-threonine protein kinase, {{exists as}} three isoforms. The Akt {{signaling}} pathway controls multiple cellular {{functions in the}} cardiovascular system, and the atheroprotective endothelial cell-dependent role of Akt 1 has been recently demonstrated. The role of Akt 3 isoform in cardiovascular pathophysiology is not known. We explored the role of Akt 3 in atherosclerosis using mice with a genetic ablation of the Akt 3 gene. Using hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice, we demonstrated a macrophage-dependent, atheroprotective role for Akt 3. In vitro experiments demonstrated differential subcellular localization of Akt 1 and Akt 3 in macrophages and showed that Akt 3 specifically inhibits macrophage cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation, a critical early event in atherogenesis. Mechanistically, Akt 3 <b>suppresses</b> <b>foam</b> cell formation by reducing lipoprotein uptake and promoting ACAT- 1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These studies demonstrate the nonredundant atheroprotective role for Akt 3 exerted via the previously unknown link between the Akt signaling pathway and cholesterol metabolism...|$|R

Plasma fueling with pellet injection, pacing of edge {{localized}} modes (ELMs) {{by small}} frequent pellets, and disruption <b>mitigation</b> <b>with</b> gas jets or injected pellets {{are some of}} the most important technological capabilities needed for successful operation of ITER. Tools are being developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that can be employed on ITER to provide the necessary core pellet fueling and the mitigation of ELMs and disruptions.

40|$|Multicarrier {{modulation}} in {{the form}} of orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) has been actively pursued in underwater acoustic communications. However, carrier frequency offset (CFO) can cause significant performance degradation in OFDM systems. Although underwater acoustic communication was recently the focus of research, literatures about joint interference <b>mitigation</b> <b>with</b> channel estimation using compressed sensing (CS) has been very limited in underwater acoustic OFDM. In the Cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) system, a novel method was proposed which combined interference <b>mitigation</b> <b>with</b> channel estimation based on compressed sensing (CS). The novel joint optimization model combined CFO estimation with CS-based channel estimation based on the sparse in the delay-Doppler domain by using the null sub-carriers. Simulations and tank experiments have verified the performance of the receiver based on the joint interference mitigation and CS channel estimation. This method enables the OFDM system is effective against the CFO, and has better robustness...|$|R
