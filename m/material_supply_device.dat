40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>devices</b> are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet discharge height on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet discharge height for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is compared with a mixing <b>supply</b> <b>device,</b> impinging <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> and displacement <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> The results show that the proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles. The proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> provides better overall ventilation performance than the mixing and displacement <b>supply</b> <b>devices</b> used in this study. This study covers also another application of confluent jets that is based on impinging technology. The <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> under consideration has an array of round jets on a curve. Multiple jets issue from the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> aperture, in which the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is positioned vertically and the jets are directed against a target wall. The flow behavior and ventilation performance of the impinging confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is studied experimentally in an industrial premise. The results show that the impinging confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> maintains acceptable thermal comfort in the occupied zone by creating well-distributed airflow during cold and hot seasons...|$|R

They are lacking in expansibility and inconsiderate to reusability and interoperability. So they can not satisfy the simulation training needs of <b>material</b> <b>supply</b> in emergent disaster. Firstly, the simulation entities of <b>material</b> <b>supply</b> in emergent disaster were analyzed. The simulation models were established based on Agent-DEVS. And the distributed interactive simulation was implemented based on HLA. Finally, the simulation test was put forward.

40|$|Lean {{production}} has {{over the last}} decades emerged {{as the most important}} paradigm for production, with the assembly processes in focus, including the objective to minimize non-value-adding work. Thus, much attention has been on the work of the assembly operator. However, little focus has been devoted to how the new requirements from lean production have been transformed into <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> systems supporting the assembly processes. Hence, the purpose of this thesis is to contribute to increased knowledge about the relation between assembly processes and <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> systems design. A framework is introduced in this thesis, describing how requirements from the assembly processes are transformed by the <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> system into the actual materials flow. In the results of this thesis, a model structuring requirements in <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> and assembly processes is proposed, tested, and subsequently different requirements were identified. Materials exposure is introduced as the transition from the <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> system to the assembly system. Results show that that the materials exposure has a large impact on assembly workstations performance in terms of space needed, non-value-adding work and ergonomics. Further, an experiment showed that the materials exposure factors with the largest impact on picking time were packaging, angle of packaging and height above floor. Major contributions in this thesis are the identification and structuring of requirements in assembly processes and <b>materials</b> <b>supply</b> systems, and explaining how the materials exposure affects the assembly processes.
