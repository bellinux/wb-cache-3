One of the couple's first visitors to the Governor's estate was a <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Dunhill, who had consumed ten beers and {{wanted to see the}} house. Lady Edwards apparently found him in the pantry; he was arrested by the police but no charges were laid. Ill health forced Edwards to resign his vice-regal appointment on 2 April 1975, and he and Lady Edwards went to live in Sydney, where he continued in semi-retirement with commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Lympne {{was to be}} the {{destination}} for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot. A <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Kiroff had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia, Bulgaria, that he was the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the personal pilot of Hitler. He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler's Focke-Wulf Fw 200 with him on board. The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the date that the defection was expected to occur. Baur did not defect and spent the war as Hitler's personal pilot. A few weeks later Rudolph Hess defected to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, a <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker {{against a}} mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears {{ignorant of the}} basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man {{has the ability to}} cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under {{the brand name}} Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds {{his way out of the}} storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight.

Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit {{to move on with}} their lives. After a meeting Elton, Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout. Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind, but Elton and Ursula leave. Ursula realises she forgot her phone, and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien, whom Elton dubs an Abzorbaloff. As Ursula and Elton see the faces of the former LINDA members on the Abzorbaloff's body, the alien reveals that he has absorbed them and wishes to also absorb the Doctor to gain his accumulated experience and knowledge. The Abzorbaloff manages to trick Ursula and absorb her as well, before pursuing Elton who attempts to escape.|$|E

25|$|This vision lasted {{approximately}} {{twenty-four hours}} and {{was said to}} have had a powerful impact on his overall perception of reality as well as his entire self. While the revelation was overpowering and transformative, it was the only visual moment where Nathan of Gaza felt that he was a true prophet. Nevertheless, in addition to his physical and mental alteration, there was another important component to the vision: Nathan of Gaza believed that a <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Shabbetai Zevi was the messiah. This strong belief in Shabbetai Zevi as the next leader of the Jewish people marked the initiation of the first Sabbatean believer, Nathan of Gaza. It also constituted the beginning of the Sabbatean movement itself.|$|E
25|$|On 23 May 1926, {{while riding}} the {{boundary}} of Nulla Nulla station, Fred Hay attacked an Aboriginal <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Lumbia.

Several native accounts exist as reported by interpreters. All the various accounts given before Lumbia's trial share a common thread, the rape of one or both of Lumbia's child wives. On hearing of Hay's death Rev Gribble rushed to Wyndham where he swore in Richard Jolly and Bernard O'Leary as special constables under the supervision of Constable Denis Regan and tasked them with finding Hay's killer.|$|E

Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E
25|$|Two iconic American {{stories have}} Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before John Smith's alleged rescue by Pocahontas, a <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from {{execution}} by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a thanksgiving—56 {{years before the}} famous Pilgrims festival—when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and garbanzo beans. As late as 1783, {{at the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States (see New Spain); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached Alaska. From 1819 to 1848, the United States and its army increased the nation's area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, including today's three most populous states: California, Texas, and Florida. Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired Southwest territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Barbados {{was also}} a major {{commercial}} point to which enslaved people from the Gold Coast (essentially Ghana) were imported before further dispersal to other British colonies such as Jamaica and British Guiana. Importation of slaves from the Gold Coast to Barbados existed from the 17th century onward to about the early 19th century. The 14 April 1816 slave revolt of Barbados, {{also known as the}} Bussa Rebellion, was led by an enslaved <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Bussa. Not much is known about his life prior to the revolt; scholars today are currently in dispute over his possible origins. It is highly likely that Bussa was a Coromantee, yet there is also reasonable speculation that he may have descended from the Igbo peoples of modern-day south-eastern Nigeria. It is also possible that Bussa had both ancestries, since slaves imported prior to the rebellion (mid- to late 16th-century shift in colonial demand for enslaved Africans from the Slave Coast) came primarily from the Gold Coast and underwent subsequent creolization of the island's enslaved African population. The Bussa incident, along with other persistent slave rebellions throughout the Caribbean, had given the British Colonial government a further incentive to pass and enact the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 in the year 1833, officially scrapping slavery as an institution in all of its Caribbean territories.|$|E
