5|$|A week later, {{plans for}} an as yet unnamed second {{documentary}} about compulsive male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the United States. In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled <b>Masturbation</b> For Girls, it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus on female <b>masturbation.</b> It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson, although the format had yet not been finalised. It was reported after the postponement of their airing that {{the second and third}} films were to be entitled I Can't Stop Wanking and <b>Masturbation</b> for Women respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Masturbation</b> is {{considered}} sinful {{for the same}} reasons as lust, but is a step above lust in that it involves a physical act instead of a mental one.|$|E
5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a <b>masturbation</b> aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in <b>masturbation.</b> She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour <b>masturbation</b> sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} <b>masturbation</b> helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early <b>masturbation</b> could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Raëlism, members of the Raëlian Church have toured public {{settings}} advocating <b>masturbation,</b> condoms and birth control. Raëlians hope that genetically modified food and nanotechnology will allow humankind to eliminate the obligation to work, {{in a world that}} embraces science and technology.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female <b>masturbation</b> is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, <b>masturbation,</b> fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E
5|$|After recuperating from {{a bout of}} phlebitis, Crowley {{set sail}} for the United States aboard the RMS Lusitania in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of Vanity Fair and {{undertaking}} freelance work for the famed astrologer Evangeline Adams. In the city, he continued experimenting with sex magic, {{through the use of}} <b>masturbation,</b> female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male <b>masturbation</b> ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by <b>masturbation</b> or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Wank Week was a {{controversial}} season of television programming that {{was due to}} be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, expected to consist {{of a series of}} three documentary programmes about <b>masturbation.</b> However, plans to broadcast it in March 2007 came under public attack from senior television figures, and the planned broadcasts were pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's public service broadcasting credentials. While Wank Week itself was cancelled, the films it was meant to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date.|$|E
5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, <b>masturbation,</b> oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating <b>Masturbation.</b> In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, <b>masturbation</b> being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Hitachi {{company had}} a {{conflict}} with Appliance Corporation of America, the American distributor of its products including the Magic Wand. The device ceased being sold briefly in the United States. In June 2000, Hitachi reached {{a deal with the}} sex toy distributor company Vibratex located in California to sell the device in the U.S. Vibratex has continued to sell the device in the U.S. through 2014. Urologist and specialist in sexual dysfunction Jed Kaminetsky told The New York Observer in 2000 that the Magic Wand had a renowned reputation. He stated he recommended the device to female patients with difficulty achieving orgasm to use in <b>masturbation.</b> Kaminetsky observed that the Magic Wand provided an extremely successful manner in which to masturbate and was among the preeminent vibrators available.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, <b>masturbation</b> and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward <b>masturbation</b> and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company to her {{was more than just}} a business, but a family too. She also enjoyed the idea of having a group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her <b>masturbation</b> scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful <b>masturbation</b> aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early <b>masturbation</b> important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
25|$|Solo <b>masturbation,</b> or <b>masturbation</b> {{involving}} {{individuals of}} the same sex, cannot produce pregnancy. <b>Masturbation</b> involving both {{a man and a}} woman (see mutual <b>masturbation)</b> can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva.|$|E
25|$|Frequency of <b>masturbation</b> is {{determined}} by many factors, e.g., one's resistance to sexual tension, hormone levels influencing sexual arousal, sexual habits, peer influences, health and one's attitude to <b>masturbation</b> formed by culture; E. Heiby and J. Becker examined the latter. Medical causes have also been associated with <b>masturbation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Castration {{does not}} prevent <b>masturbation,</b> as it is {{observed}} in geldings. <b>Masturbation</b> is common in both mares and stallions, before and after puberty.|$|E
25|$|In the US, <b>masturbation</b> was a diagnosable {{psychological}} condition until DSM II (1968). The American Medical Association consensually declared <b>masturbation</b> {{as normal}} in 1972.|$|E
25|$|It {{is held in}} many {{mental health}} circles that <b>masturbation</b> can relieve {{depression}} and lead to a higher sense of self-esteem. <b>Masturbation</b> can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other – in which case <b>masturbation</b> provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>masturbation</b> {{describes}} broad changes in society concerning the ethics, social attitudes, scientific study, and artistic depiction of <b>masturbation</b> over {{the history of}} human sexuality.|$|E
25|$|In the US <b>masturbation</b> has {{not been}} a diagnosable {{condition}} since DSM II (1968). The American Medical Association consensually declared <b>masturbation</b> as normal in 1972.|$|E
25|$|<b>Masturbation</b> is {{the sexual}} {{stimulation}} of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually {{to the point}} of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators, or combinations of these. Mutual <b>masturbation</b> (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration. Studies have found that <b>masturbation</b> is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to <b>masturbation</b> in particular. No causal relationship is known between <b>masturbation</b> and any form of mental or physical disorder.|$|E
25|$|Within the African Congo Basin, the Aka and Ngandu {{ethnic groups}} all lack {{a word for}} <b>masturbation</b> in their {{languages}} and are confused by the concept of <b>masturbation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Masturbation</b> {{is little}} {{noted in the}} sources for ancient Roman sexuality. The poet Martial {{considers}} it an inferior form of sexual release resorted to by slaves. Though infrequently mentioned, <b>masturbation</b> was a longstanding theme in Latin satire, appearing {{in one of the}} few surviving fragments of Lucilius, Rome's earliest practitioner of the genre. The Romans preferred the left hand for <b>masturbation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{arousal and}} <b>masturbation</b> in women produce small {{increases}} in testosterone concentrations. The plasma levels of various steroids significantly increase after <b>masturbation</b> {{in men and}} the testosterone levels correlate to those levels.|$|E
25|$|In the Western world, <b>masturbation</b> {{in private}} {{or with a}} partner is {{generally}} considered a normal and healthy part of sexual enjoyment. Animal <b>masturbation</b> has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{story of}} Onan (Gen. 38) is {{traditionally}} linked to referring to <b>masturbation</b> and condemnation thereof, but the sexual act described by {{this story is}} coitus interruptus, not masturbation.}} There is no explicit claim in the Bible that <b>masturbation</b> is sinful.|$|E
25|$|Solo <b>masturbation</b> is {{a sexual}} {{activity}} that is free of risk of sexually transmitted infections. With two or more participants, the risk of sexually transmitted infections, while not eliminated, is much less than with most forms of penetrative sex. Support for such a view, and for making <b>masturbation</b> part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration. Some EU Nations promote <b>masturbation</b> in their sex education curricula.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{addressed}} <b>masturbation</b> in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality {{and associated}} it with addictive substances. He described the <b>masturbation</b> of infants at {{the period when}} the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate whether}} <b>masturbation</b> should be {{promoted}} in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany <b>masturbation,</b> {{are common in}} American correctional facilities. Connecticut Department of Corrections officials say that these restrictions are intended to avoid a hostile work environment for correctional officers. Other researchers argue allowing <b>masturbation</b> could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in prison rape or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks.|$|E
