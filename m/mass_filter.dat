25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or <b>mass</b> <b>filter.</b> Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E

The third quadrupole also acts as a <b>mass</b> <b>filter,</b> to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector.

We studied its ion guiding, focusing, and <b>mass</b> <b>filtering</b> capabilities by SIMION ver. 7. 0 computer simulations. An electric field mathematical model was developed to calculate the pseudopotential of the tripole radial AC force. The tripole showed stable ion guiding for wide ranges of AC amplitude; better collisional focusing than hexapole and octapole and similar focusing as quadrupole (rod pole). Also, the ion optic clearly showed interesting <b>mass</b> <b>filtering</b> potential when the phase shift was asymmetrically delayed. The symmetric shape of the pseudopotential field explained the tripole ion guiding and focusing capabilities.

5000|$|Both {{the first}} mass {{analyzer}} and the collision cell are continuously exposed to ions from the source, {{in a time}} independent manner. It is once the ions move into the third mass analyzer that time dependence becomes a factor.

This collision cell is an RF-only quadrupole (non-mass filtering) using Ar, He, or N2 gas (~10−3 Torr, ~30 eV) for collision induced dissociation of selected parent ion(s) from Q1. Subsequent fragments are passed through to Q3 where they may be filtered or fully scanned.|$|R

40|$|Mass {{analysis}} with linear quadrupole <b>mass</b> <b>filters</b> is possible by forming “islands” in the stability diagram with auxiliary quadrupole excitation. In this work, computer simulations {{are used to}} calculate stability boundaries, island positions, and peak shapes and ion transmission for mass {{analysis with}} linear quadrupole <b>mass</b> <b>filters</b> that have added octopole fields of about 2 to 4 %. Rod sets with exact geometries that have quadrupole and octopole fields only in the potential, and round rod sets, with multipoles up to N = 10 (the twenty pole term) included in the calculations, show the same stability boundaries, island positions, and peak shapes. With the DC voltage applied to the rods so that the Mathieu parameter a 0, the resolution and transmission are poor preventing conventional mass analysis. In principle, mass analysis in an island is possible with operation at either of two tips. Provided the correct island tip is chosen for mass analysis, peak shapes comparable to those with a > 0 and no excitation are possible, both with a > 0 and with a < 0. In the latter case, {{the use of an}} island of stability allows mass analysis when the added octopole otherwise prevents conventional mass analysis...|$|R

50|$|Quadrupole mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field. A common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a <b>mass</b> <b>filter</b> to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the existence of a primordial magnetic field on the <b>filter</b> <b>mass,</b> characterizing the minimum baryonic mass that can form in dark matter (DM) haloes. For <b>masses</b> below the <b>filter</b> <b>mass,</b> the baryon content of DM haloes are severely depressed. The <b>filter</b> <b>mass</b> is the mass when the baryon to DM mass ratio in a halo is equal to half the baryon to DM ratio of the Universe. The <b>filter</b> <b>mass</b> has previously been used in semi-analytic calculations of galaxy formation, without taking into account the possible existence of a primordial magnetic field. We examine here its effect on the <b>filter</b> <b>mass.</b> For homogeneous comoving primordial magnetic fields of B(0) similar to 1 or 2 nG and a re-ionization epoch that starts at a redshift z(s) = 11 and is completed at z(r) = 8, the <b>filter</b> <b>mass</b> is increased at redshift 8, for example, by factors of 4. 1 and 19. 8, respectively. The dependence of the <b>filter</b> <b>mass</b> on the parameters describing the re-ionization epoch is investigated.

40|$|I use {{simulations}} of cosmological reionization {{to quantify the}} effect of photoionization on the gas fraction in low mass objects, in particular the characteristic mass scale below which the gas fraction is reduced compared to the universal value. I show that this characteristic scale can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if one defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the evolution of this characteristic suppression <b>mass.</b> Instead, the <b>filtering</b> <b>mass,</b> which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the characteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on structure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a single characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In contrast to the Jeans <b>mass,</b> the <b>filtering</b> <b>mass</b> depends on the full thermal history of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it accounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas distribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic suppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to find an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total mass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple fitting formula that again depends only on the <b>filtering</b> <b>mass.</b> This simple description of the probability distribution may be useful for semi-analytical modeling of structure formation in the early universe.
