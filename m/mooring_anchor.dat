40|$|Abstract: The {{designed}} double-drum winch {{is applied}} to the development of Liwan 3 - 1 gas field of the South China Sea for lowering <b>mooring</b> <b>anchor</b> chains, which is composed of motor, brake, reducer, front and rear drums, two-stage gear transmission devices, rack and base. There is an intermediate axle between two drums of the winch. On the intermediate axle there are two gears, a large one and a small one. The large gear installed on the intermediate axle goes into mesh with the pinion gear installed on the output shaft of reducer, and the small gear installed on intermediate axle meshes with the large gears installed on the front and rear drums separately. The speed of rotate from the motor is sent to the two-stage gear transmission devices by the reducer, to realize two drums rotate simultaneously in the same direction. Compared to the double-drum winch of multi-motor synchronous drive, the designed double-drum winch can be more reliable and avoid the difficult technical problems of multi-motor synchronous drive and control in a large extent...|$|E
40|$|As the {{offshore}} wind power tends to locate farther from the coast for efficient generation of electricity, the interest of foundation systems of which construction sequence is economical and convenient under deep water circumstance is increasing. <b>Mooring</b> <b>anchor</b> system has been utilized {{as one of the}} most popular ways for anchoring of vessels or floating structures, and various types of anchor and mooring system have been investigated for large structures under diverse loading condition. In this paper, the pullout behavior of the modified embedded suction anchor (ESA) is studied using numerical analysis. The behavior of the embedded suction anchor is simulated using finite element method, and Adaptive Meshing (AM) technique approach incorporated in Abaqus/Explicit is applied to simulate the large deformation of soil caused by continuous pullout of anchor. The three dimensional modeling is performed to duplicate the round body shape with flanges of the embedded suction anchor. The anchor is assumed as rigid body and clay is considered as a linear elastic-perfectly plastic soil model with a Tresca yield criterion. The pullout capacities after different initial rotations show similar results with the maximum horizontal pullout capacity and the load inclination of 30 ?? or 40 ?? at the bottom point of the ESA has an advantage in that reduced pullout load can rotate the ESA...|$|E

40|$|The {{offshore}} oilfield {{industry is}} continuously developing unique and break-through technologies and systems to extract hydrocarbons from ever increasing ocean depths. Due {{to the extreme}} depths being explored presently, large anchors are being utilized to secure temporary and permanent facilities over their respective drilling/production site. A vertically loaded, torpedo-style, deepwater <b>mooring</b> <b>anchor</b> developed by Delmar Systems, Inc. {{is one of these}} anchors. The OMNI-Max anchor is an efficient, cost-effective alternative for use as a mooring system anchor intended for floating facilities. The OMNI-Max is designed to free-fall towards the ocean bottom and uses its kinetic energy for self-embedment into the soil, providing a mooring system anchor point. Values such as drag coefficient and terminal velocity are vital in predicting embedment depth to obtain the mooring capacity required by the floating facility. Two scaled models of the Mark I OMNI-Max anchor were subjected to a series of tests in the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A & M University to evaluate the overall drag coefficient and penetration depth. The 1 / 24 scale model was tested by measuring the amount of penetration into an artificial mud mixture. The 1 / 15 scale model was attached to a tow carriage and towed through a water-filled tank to measure the drag forces and evaluate the drag coefficient. The anchor terminal velocity was measured using underwater cameras to track the free fall of the model anchor through 15 ft of water inside the tow tank. The 1 / 24 scale model penetrated the mud an average of 22 inches from the leading tip of the anchor to the mud surface, approximately 1. 5 anchor lengths. The penetration depth increased as impact velocity increased, while the penetration depth decreased as the fins were retracted. The 1 / 15 scale anchor was towed at 6 different velocities producing a varied total drag coefficient between 0. 70 and 1. 12 for Reynolds number flows between 3. 08 E 05 and 1. 17 E 06. The drag coefficient increased as the fins were retracted and when the mooring rope was attached. The 1 / 15 scale anchor was allowed to free-fall in the tow tank and obtained an average terminal velocity of and 14. 6 feet per second. The drag coefficients ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 83, which increased as the fins were retracted. When using the results to estimate prototype sized anchor drag coefficient, the average value was estimated to be 0. 75...|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{underwater}} structures currently {{of interest to}} FLUPA consist of canal barges which sank in the 19th century. These once sturdy wooden barges have become extremely fragile and are susceptible to both natural and man made means of deterioration.

5000|$|Anchors achieve {{holding power}} either by [...] "hooking" [...] into the seabed, via sheer mass, or a {{combination}} of the two.

Teak transited the canal on 15 December 1942; departed Balboa on Christmas Eve; and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 6 January 1943. Based at Tiburon Naval Net Depot on West San Francisco Bay, she began tending the harbor's antisubmarine nets on the 10th. Throughout 1943 and into 1944, Teak patrolled and maintained the nets which protected the anchorages and harbor of San Francisco Bay. She inspected the nets, repaired and replaced worn parts and buoys, and freed <b>mooring</b> <b>anchors</b> and an occasional ship fouled in the nets. These routine but vital duties were varied by repairs at Alameda, California, with gunnery drills in October, and with a voyage to San Pedro, California, in December.|$|R

5000|$|This {{basic design}} {{remained}} unchanged for centuries, {{with the most}} significant changes being to the overall proportions, and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor, {{there is a great}} tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts. When this happens, the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom, and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re-set. In the mid-19th century, numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems, as well as improve holding power, including one-armed <b>mooring</b> <b>anchors.</b> The most successful of these patent anchors, the Trotman Anchor, introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank, allowing the [...] "idle" [...] arm to fold against the shank.|$|R
