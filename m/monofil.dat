50|$|Some {{industrial}} plants installed in Ponta Grossa are <b>Monofil</b> 2, LP Masisa, Makita, Femsa Brewery, Continental, Tetra Pak, Beaulieu of Brazil, Louis Dreyfus, Cargill, Bunge, Batavia, Sadia, among others especially the food-milling industry. In the Industrial District is also installed is the granary of CONAB (National Supply Company), the largest store of grain in Brazil, with load capacity to 420 tons. In August 2011, Paccar announced it selected a 200 hectare industrial site, {{to build a}} 4 hectare facility to build DAF trucks. DAF is a Dutch brand of trucks. The facility will employ about 500 workers directly.|$|E
30|$|Factory “monofil_extr” {{produces}} polymer threads by <b>monofil</b> extrusion. Different polymers can be {{used for}} the threads and through additives the properties and chemical resistances are varied. This production also requires the pre-treatment of the polymers to ensure required moisture content. The number of holes in the die plate allows simultaneous extrusion of numerous threads on 17 production lines. Each production line includes several post-treatment steps. The threads are cooled in water tanks and afterwards stretched between drafting units that run at different speeds. The fixation is located in a hot air chamber. Afterwards the threads are rolled up.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Most central venous {{catheters}} {{are placed}} using Seldinger guide wires. EN ISO 11070 is the guideline for testing guide wire flexing performance and tensile strength, {{and we can}} safely assume that guide wires in use meet these requirements. Unfortunately, EN ISO 11070 guidelines {{do not reflect the}} clinical requirements and we continue to see mechanical failures and their associated complications. Material and Methods: This in vitro study was performed in an accredited laboratory. With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various guide wires relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the guide wire was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two basic wire constructions, <b>monofil</b> and core and coil. Results: Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15. 06 N to 257. 76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The <b>monofil</b> had no evidence of bending. Two core/coil wires displayed minor bending (angle 1. 5 °). All other wires displayed bending angles between 22. 5 ° and 43. 0 °. Conclusion: We recommend that: (1) Clinicians use guide wires with high-end mechanical properties, (2) EN ISO 11070 incorporate our flexing test into their testing method, raise the flexing requirement to kink-proof, (3) and raise the tensile strength requirement to a minimum of 30 N, and (3) all manufacturers and suppliers be required to display mechanical properties of all guide wire, and guide wire kits sold...|$|E
30|$|The power {{needed for}} customising and {{post-processing}} {{is particularly important}} in the monofil_extr process. These treatment steps are required by the <b>monofils,</b> which involve multiple cooling and warming process stages. Like in the plastification process, electricity {{is used for the}} generation of thermal energy. In contrast, the post-processing process in moulding is negligible. For the customisation stages, pneumatic packaging robots are utilised. Their power demand is low in comparison to the compressed air. Energy use of the compressors is assigned as “technical support”.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{and other}} climatic variables, {{such as the}} amount of rainfall, are the main abiotic factors {{affecting}} the level of herbivory and plant´s properties. Following a change in these factors, the rate of herbivory and the level of plant defence against them alter as well. This bachelor´s thesis examines how a population of a host plant, the red fescue (Festuca rubra), affects the development of the small heath butterfly (Coenonympha pamphilus). The fescues came from four different locations in Norway with varying local climates. Young caterpillars (first instar) of the small heath butterfly were placed upon the fescues. They are typical generalist herbivores (the caterpillars consume common grass species). 5 or 6 caterpillars had been placed on each plant which were then isolated from the outside environment with a dense <b>monofil.</b> Subsequently, the fescues were moved to an outside bed until the caterpillars created a chrysalis. The survival rate of the caterpillars on each individual fescue was calculated as a ratio of all the caterpillars surviving up to the last instar to the original amount of planted caterpillars. The caterpillars´ survival rate was better with the fescues originating from a higher altitude (lower average temperatures) and worse with those from lower altitudes (higher average temperatures). This makes it safe to assume that lower altitude plants have adapted better for defence against herbivory. The females overall weighted more than their male counterparts. There was a difference in weight between the populations but the significance of this should be taken with a grain of salt since the number of measured adults was low. The results of this thesis follow the general assumption {{of the fact that the}} level of herbivory changes with altitude; with greater heights it decrease...|$|E
