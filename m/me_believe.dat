500|$|Sue's {{philosophical}} {{argument with}} Emma about religion {{is the scene}} that Murphy is [...] "most proud to {{have been involved with}} in [...] entire career." [...] Explaining Sue's stance on religion, he stated: [...] "Sue's an atheist, but I love that she doesn't want to be. She and [...] are both saying to the world, 'Prove us wrong: If God is kindness and love, make <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> in God. Murphy felt {{it would have been easy}} to have Kurt sing an anti-religious song, but instead chose to have him sing about his faith in love.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E

500|$|Burt's {{defense of}} Kurt from a slur by Finn in [...] "Theatricality" [...] was called [...] "one of the {{heaviest}} scenes Glee has ever delved into" [...] by Eric Goldman of IGN. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called the scene [...] "utterly heartbreaking and lovely". He added, [...] "it {{was an amazing}} moment for Glee, capped off by the simple gesture of Burt grabbing his son's shoulder {{in an act of}} support. Mike O'Malley is completely Emmy-worthy. We've never seen a character like this before on television or seen such a relationship between a father and son." [...] Poniewozik wrote, [...] "Mike O'Malley, as always, made <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> that Burt was not speaking out of some false enlightenment but out of a desire to protect his family and a struggle to do the right thing." [...] BuddyTV's Henrik Batallones said O'Malley was [...] "the star of the show".|$|E
500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> that I did my best to try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E
500|$|According to Colfer, Glees creators {{initially}} [...] "were {{leaning on}} [...] being overly flamboyant". However, the actor {{stated that he}} did not want to take that approach [...] "because it's so overdone". Instead, he decided to portray the character as [...] "more internal and superior." [...] Colfer has explained that Kurt [...] "puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona," [...] but that [...] "underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point." [...] Colfer also commented, [...] "In later episodes, [...] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes." [...] In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is [...] "very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer Marc Jacobs before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode. The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] centered around Kurt's atheism, with Murphy explaining that Kurt is [...] "saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> in God.|$|E

500|$|At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International, she {{encountered}} now-former Tokyopop editors Mark Paniccia and Lillian M. Diaz-Przybyl, who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher. Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days, and commented: [...] "It made <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> {{there is room}} for diverse stories." [...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted to do something different from manhwa or manga," [...] which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year. However, in May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American branch, with the status of global manga titles left unclear. 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ashraful {{made his}} Test debut on 6 September 2001 against Sri Lanka. He top-scored in each innings, and {{although}} Bangladesh slumped to an innings defeat, Ashraful scored 114, {{and in the}} process became the youngest player to score a Test century, beating Mushtaq Mohammad's record, and was named man of the match. In the process, he became just the second Bangladesh player to score a Test century on debut, the first since Aminul Islam Bulbul in 2000 during Bangladesh's first Test. Trevor Chappell, a former coach of Bangladesh's national side, commented that [...] "His determination, commitment and attention to detail would put a mature and an established person to shame. The manner he concentrates on his batting made <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> that the lad is destined to have a long cricketing journey." [...] Following the century, Ashraful began receiving high expectations. However, a prolonged string of poor performances and soft dismissals resulted in him being dropped from the national team.|$|E

2500|$|Sue is {{initially}} presented as the glee club's [...] "arch-nemesis". Following the pilot episode, Lynch {{said she is}} [...] "pure evil and doesn't hide it", explaining that she was created {{as a product of}} Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's [...] "inner mean girl". Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both [...] "horrible and really delightful at the same time", assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says. She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about [...] "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win. Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome. She is depicted as kind and loving towards Jean, though Lynch stated that exploration of Sue's humanity would be limited. Sue is an atheist, but according to Murphy, does not want to be. He explained, [...] "She [...] saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make <b>me</b> <b>believe</b> in God.'" [...] The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] focuses on the characters' differing approaches to religion. Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), which Murphy describes as the scene he is [...] "most proud to have been involved with in [...] entire career." [...] On the fifth-season episode [...] "Puppet Master", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then Principal Figgins [...] "insulted" [...] her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to [...] "try some pants" [...] because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment she put the track suit on, [...] "the world bowed before her" [...] and that she [...] "had one made in every color".|$|E
