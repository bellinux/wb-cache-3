5|$|If oral <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> {{mechanical}} treatments fail, {{the second}} choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis. This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
5|$|Oral <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> {{mechanical}} {{devices are}} the first choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E

5|$|Emergency medical {{technician}} – Also known as Ambulance Technician. Technicians are usually {{able to perform}} {{a wide range of}} emergency care skills, such as defibrillation, spinal immobilization, bleeding control, splinting of suspected fractures, assisting the patient with certain <b>medications,</b> <b>and</b> oxygen therapy. Some countries split this term into levels (such as in the US, where there is EMT-Basic and EMT-Intermediate).|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> drug overdoses {{can result}} in seizures, as may certain <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> drug withdrawal. Common drugs {{involved}} include: antidepressants, antipsychotics, cocaine, insulin, and the local anaesthetic lidocaine. Difficulties with withdrawal seizures commonly occurs after prolonged alcohol or sedative use, a condition known as delerium tremens.|$|R

5|$|Most {{cases of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} resolve {{with time and}} conservative methods of treatment. Usually {{for the first few}} weeks people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain <b>medications,</b> <b>and</b> stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E
5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> neurorehabilitation {{have been}} shown to improve some {{symptoms}}, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E

5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, <b>medications,</b> <b>and</b> medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{affect the}} amount of pain experienced {{and the degree to}} which it interferes with daily life; and the American Institute of Medicine and the American Pain Society support the inclusion of expert, quality-controlled psychosocial care as part of cancer pain management. Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring). Education may be more helpful to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that track surfaces, horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal <b>medications,</b> <b>and</b> high-intensity racing {{schedules}} may also contribute to a high injury rate. One promising trend {{is the development of}} synthetic surfaces for racetracks, {{and one of the first}} tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004–05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation. The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of an education program on the knowledge of <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> prevention of depression in the elderly at a local community. Methods: This study utilized the nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. Thirty consecutive people were included in this study for the experimental group, and another 30 people were allocated to the control group. The program was performed once a week for 3 weeks. Data were collected from March 15 to April 30, 2010 and statistical analyses were performed by x 2 -test and independent t-test using the SPSS/WIN 12. 0 program. Results: There were statistically significant differences in the knowledge of <b>medication,</b> depression <b>and</b> <b>medication</b> compliance between the experimental and control groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that an education program for the knowledge of <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> prevention of depression in the elderly with chronic disease could improve their knowledge of <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> their <b>medication</b> compliance, <b>and</b> decrease their depression. These results suggest that education of knowledge with social psychology can be an effective and practical method of management to th...|$|R
40|$|<b>Medication</b> {{complexity}} <b>and</b> nonadherence {{are significant}} {{risk factors for}} avoidable hospitalizations and health care spending for older adults in the United States. However, limited empirical research has investigated pharmacist-run telephonic medication management programs as a potential {{solution to the problem}} of reducing medication complexity while improving medication adherence. This quantitative study employed the behavioral change model to analyze archival data from a sample of 1, 148 participants, examining the relationship of a pharmacist-run telephonic consulting program on <b>medication</b> adherence <b>and</b> <b>medication</b> complexity for one pharmacy benefit management firm 2 ̆ 7 s Medicare Part D recipients.
