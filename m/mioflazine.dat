40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>mioflazine</b> (R 51 469) on infarct size was studied in anesthetized dogs {{subjected}} to 24 h of LAD (left anterior descending) coronary artery occlusion. The myocardium normally {{supplied by the}} occluded coronary artery (perfusion area, PA) was delineated by perfusion of the arterial bed distal to the occlusion with colorless fluid while {{the remainder of the}} heart was simultaneously perfused with an Evans blue solution. After sectioning the heart, infarct areas (IA) could be visualized by incubation of the slices in triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC). Quantification of the areas was performed using a Quantimet 900 image analysis system. The animals either received <b>mioflazine</b> (2. 5 mg X kg- 1 orally) or a same volume of 20 % polypropylene glycol, the solvent of <b>mioflazine</b> 2. 5 h {{before the start of the}} surgical procedure. For perfusion areas greater than 20 % of the left ventricle infarct size was significantly reduced in <b>mioflazine</b> pretreated animals compared with the control group, both expressed as per cent of the left ventricle (10. 6 +/- 2. 3 vs 19. 2 +/- 1. 5, p less than 0. 005) and as per cent of the perfusion area (35. 1 +/- 7 vs 64. 4 +/- 5, p less than 0. 005). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The cardioprotective {{effects of}} <b>mioflazine,</b> a {{recently}} developed cardiovascular drug, were investigated in 41 anaesthetised open chest Beagle dogs subjected to 1 h normothermic global myocardial ischaemia. The {{severity of the}} model {{is evidenced by the}} finding that only one out of 20 control dogs could be weaned from extracorporeal bypass. Oral pretreatment with <b>mioflazine</b> (2. 5 mg X kg- 1) resulted in complete functional recovery in 17 out of 20 animals. Biochemical analysis of left ventricular biopsies taken before, during and after aortic cross clamping showed a preservation of purines and a better recovery of ATP, ATP/ADP X Pi ratio and energy charge (p less than 0. 05) in the pretreated animals. Morphological and cytochemical assessment of the myocardium demonstrated that the ultrastructure of the sarcolemma and its calcium binding capacity is remarkably well preserved in the drug treated animals. These results indicate a strong cardioprotective effect of <b>mioflazine.</b> The biochemical, cytochemical and ultrastructural findings suggest an interaction of the drug with the sarcolemma. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|With the aim {{of gaining}} more insight into the {{metabolism}} of adenine nucleotides in working normoxic guinea-pigs and in hearts subjected to 45 min of global ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion for 25 min, we evaluated the effect of nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil, CERM 11956, lidoflazine, <b>mioflazine</b> and dipyridamole on the adenine nucleotide catabolite levels in these hearts. The drugs were applied at the concentrations that reduced the aortic dP/dt of normoxic working hearts by 10 % (EC 10) and 30 % (EC 30). In globally ischaemic hearts {{there was a large}} accumulation of adenine nucleotide catabolites. Inosine proved to be the major catabolite. The drugs, with the exception of bepridil, CERM 11956 and dipyridamole (3 mumol/l), decreased the accumulation of catabolites. In hearts treated with <b>mioflazine</b> and dipyridamole the amount of adenosine increased. A deficit in the balance between adenine nucleotides and catabolites indicated that in globally ischaemic hearts there was a large accumulation of inosine monophosphate. Indeed, a substantial amount of inosine monophosphate was determined in untreated hearts, and hearts treated with nifedipine (EC 30) and <b>mioflazine</b> (EC 10). During the first 5 min of reperfusion a large quantity of catabolites, mainly inosine, was washed out. During 20 min of subsequent reperfusion in untreated hearts and in nifedipine and mioflazine-treated hearts the efflux of catabolites returned to normoxic values. Similar to the effect in ischaemic hearts, in early perfusate from lidoflazine, <b>mioflazine</b> and dipyridamole-treated hearts the adenosine/inosine ratio was increased.

40|$|The {{effects of}} oral {{pretreatment}} with <b>mioflazine</b> (2. 5 mg X kg- 1) on regional myocardial reflow, infarct size reduction and hemodynamic recovery were studied in 24 anesthetized open-chest dogs undergoing 90 minutes of acute left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 150 minutes of reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow {{was measured with}} tracer microspheres, and infarct size was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Pretreatment with <b>mioflazine</b> resulted in a reduced diastolic aortic pressure (p less than 0. 05) and an elevated cardiac output and LV dpdt max (p less than 0. 05). These effects persisted throughout the experiment. In control animals (n = 12) a hyperemic reflow response {{was found in the}} perfusion area of the LAD during the first minutes of reperfusion. After 150 min of reperfusion, however, the viable myocardium of the LAD area became underperfused, and almost no reflow was found in the infarcted zones. In the animals pretreated with <b>mioflazine</b> (n = 12) the hyperemic response persisted throughout the reperfusion phase and the no-reflow phenomenon was prevented. Infarct size (expressed as percentage of perfusion area) tended to be smaller in this group: 23. 7 +/- 12. 4 % versus 33. 7 +/- 19. 2 % (p greater than 0. 05). Left atrial pressure increased during LAD occlusion in both groups but normalized completely in the drug-pretreated animals (p less than 0. 05). It is concluded that pretreatment with <b>mioflazine</b> prevents the no-reflow phenomenon after reperfusion of an evolving infarction, tends to reduce infarct size and improves hemodynamic recovery. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of nifedipine (20 nM) and <b>mioflazine</b> (300 nM), i. e. concentrations inducing a 60 - 70 % recovery of cardiac function during reperfusion of globally ischaemic guinea-pig working hearts, on the mitochondrial calcium content {{was investigated in}} normoxic, globally ischaemic and reperfused globally ischaemic guinea-pig working hearts. Mitochondrial calcium was determined electronmicroscopically with oxalate-pyroantimonate method. In normoxic hearts both nifedipine and <b>mioflazine</b> reduced the mitochondrial calcium content. Global ischaemia for 45 min and subsequent reperfusion for 25 min resulted in a pronounced mitochondrial calcium overload and damage to the cellular structure.

40|$|In dog myocardium, {{the changes}} in the levels of {{creatine}} phosphate, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine and inosine with 8 min of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 min have been followed. Creatine phosphate and inorganic phosphate recovered completely within a few minutes as did the energy charge. However, total nucleotides remained depressed, the decrease being compensated for by the increase in inosine levels during ischemia. There was a rapid removal of the latter with reperfusion. Low oral doses of <b>mioflazine</b> (2. 5 mg X kg- 1), given 2. 5 h before LAD occlusion, did not affect the pattern of changes seen in control animals, except for the nucleosides. The drug induced a complete reversal of the adenosine to inosine ratio during ischemia and a remarkable prolongation of the accumulation within the tissue of mainly adenosine during early reperfusion and inosine afterwards. Assuming that the main action of <b>mioflazine</b> is through inhibition of nucleoside transport, the present results provide interesting information about the mechanism of release, metabolism and final washout of adenosine. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine influx and formycin B influx and efflux were {{characterized}} in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes at 22 degrees. Transport by both modes was saturable and inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), indicating {{the presence of}} an equilibrative NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter in the cardiomyocytes. The kinetic constants for influx and efflux of formycin B, a non-metabolized nucleoside, were similar, suggesting that the nucleoside transporter exhibits symmetrical kinetics (apparent K-m 490 +/- 160 and 700 +/- 140 mu M; V-max, 6. 5 +/- 1. 7 and 3. 5 +/- 0. 3 nmol/ 10 (6) cells per min for influx and efflux, respectively). No evidence was found of either NBMPR-insensitive equilibrative nucleoside transport or sodium-dependent concentrative nucleoside transport. Inhibition of adenosine influx (apparent K(m) 100 +/- 33 mu M), by lidoflazine and the analogues <b>mioflazine,</b> soluflazine and R 73 - 335, gave average K-i values of 730, 100, 64 and 2. 9 nM, respectively. These compounds also inhibited formycin B efflux with a similar potency to that of adenosine influx. NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport was associated with high affinity binding of NBMPR (apparent K-d similar to 1 nM; 9. 6 x 10 (5) sites/cell). Specific binding of NBMPR was also inhibited by lidoflazine and its analogues. <b>Mioflazine</b> and soluflazine were 20 - 30 -fold more potent at inhibiting NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside influx in guinea-pig erythrocytes than ventricular myocytes, indicating that the potency of some of the compounds studied is tissue dependent...|$|E
40|$|The cardioprotective {{effects of}} nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil, CERM 11956, lidoflazine, <b>mioflazine</b> and the {{coronary}} vasodilator dipyridamole were evaluated in the guinea-pig working heart {{with respect to}} cardiac function and high energy phosphate content after 45 min of global ischaemia and 25 min of reperfusion. All drugs, {{with the exception of}} dipyridamole, induced a negative inotropic effect, which resulted in a decrease of the aortic pressure (AoP), of its first derivative dAoP/dt and the cardiac output. To compare the anti-ischaemic effect of the calcium antagonists, concentrations were selected that reduced the dAoP/dt by 10 % (EC 10) and 30 % (EC 30), respectively. With the exception of nifedipine at the EC 10 and bepridil and CERM 11956 at the EC 30, perfusion with the calcium antagonists and dipyridamole (3 mumol/l) improved the recovery of contractile function after global ischaemia and reperfusion to a value between 60 and 80 % of the controls in normoxic hearts. Pretreatment with nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, lidoflazine and <b>mioflazine,</b> but not with bepridil, CERM 11956 and dipyridamole led to slightly increased ATP levels in ischaemic hearts as compared to the control value in ischaemic hearts. After subsequent reperfusion for 25 min, for all drugs, ATP levels were further enhanced to 50 % of the level in normoxic hearts; phosphocreatine levels reached normoxic values. In particular at the EC 30, the effects of calcium antagonists on cardiac function varied in accordance with their known pharmacological and physiological profile. However, there appeared to exist no direct relationship between their beneficial effects on contractile activity and those on the levels of high energy phosphates after ischaemia and reperfusio...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis {{was made of}} the changes in canine myocardium, with time of occlusion, in several important metabolites such as creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate (luminometry), inorganic phosphate (spectrophotometry), and most of the purines and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (high performance liquid chromatography). Within 1 min there was a significant reduction in creatine phosphate and a significant increase in inorganic phosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate. A decrease in adenosine triphosphate became apparent after 4 min, concomitant with a progressive rise in the nucleosides, which reached almost 50 % of the total purines after 64 min of occlusion. The formation of hypoxanthine was detectable in 50 % only of all animals, suggesting a lack of active nucleoside phosphorylase in the others. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, although decreasing slightly, was by far the most constant of all variables measured during at least 30 min of ischaemia. Therefore, this component is suggested to be a useful internal standard, thus minimising analytical and biological variations. <b>Mioflazine,</b> a potent nucleoside transport inhibitor (I 50 3 X 10 (- 8) mol X litre- 1), when given orally at 2. 5 mg X kg- 1, did not affect any of the changes {{with the exception of the}} nucleosides, where the drug completely inverts the adenosine to inosine ratio. The contribution of adenosine to the total nucleosides changed from 20 % in the controls to 80 % with treatment during at least 16 min of occlusion, there being no overlap between the groups. It is concluded therefore that adenosine is not deaminated in the cell where it is produced. It is not yet clear how this notable effect of <b>mioflazine</b> could be linked to its remarkable protective effect against ischaemia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Kinetic {{analysis}} of the binding of [3 H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3 H] NBMPR) to Ehrlich ascites tumor cell plasma membranes was conducted in the presence and absence {{of a variety of}} nucleoside transport inhibitors and substrates. The association of [3 H} NBMPR with Ehrlich cell membranes occurred in two distinct phases, possibly reflecting functional conformation changes in the [3 H]NBMPR binding site/nucleoside transporter complex. Inhibitors of the equilibrium binding of [3 H]NBMPR, tested at submaximal inhibitory concentrations, generally decreased the rate of association of [3 H]NBMPR, but the magnitude of this effect varied significantly with the agent tested. Adenosine and diazepam had relatively minor effects on the association rate, whereas dipyridamole and <b>mioflazine</b> slowed the rate dramati-cally.

In addition, the hypothesis that the es and ei nucleoside transporters in rabbit cortical synaptosomes differ in their selectivity for compounds besides nitrobenzylthioinosine was tested, Nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive (dollar 3 dollarH) dipyridamole binding and (dollar 3 dollarH) nitrobenzylthioinosine binding involved the same site on the es transporter. The relative proportions and inhibitor sensitivities of nitrobenzylthioinosine-resistant (dollar 3 dollarH) dipyridamole binding could not be correlated with nitrobenzylthioinosine-resistant nucleoside transport. This, and other data, suggested that the nitrobenzylthioinosine-resistant (dollar 3 dollarH) dipyridamole binding site(s) involved membrane components distinct from those associated with functional, ei nucleoside transporters. In addition, none of the substrates examined in the rabbit were selective for one transporter subtype over the other.;R 75231 is a newly developed <b>mioflazine</b> derivative which has extremely tight binding characteristics in vitro and in vivo. The hypothesis that R 75231 bound to the es nucleoside transporter in an irreversible manner was tested.

Binding of (dollar 3 dollarH) R 75231 to human erythrocyte ghost membranes was reversible, but the rate of dissociation depended upon the displacer used. R 75231 and <b>mioflazine</b> slowed the rate of dissociation of (dollar 3 dollarH) R 75231, and caused an initial increase of site-bound (dollar 3 dollarH) R 75231.
