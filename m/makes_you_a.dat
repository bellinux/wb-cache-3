Stone said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us. We believe the first way, that society controls you and <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better person, ultimately, because when you're little, you're just a little asshole." ...|$|E

After this, the group perform a choreography in front of the pool, in which they pull [...] "each other in closer, in an unbreakable ring of limbs". This is Lipa and Scholfield's favorite scene, with the latter stating, [...] "That wrapped up the whole story for me. The viewer is on the outside, but that choreography pulls you into them, and <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> part of that connection, too." [...] The video ends with the women standing in front of the pool, with the camera turning upside-down and then showing a group of flamingos at the same location.|$|E
500|$|After Webb's death, Gibbons {{remained}} at Oakshott Avenue {{and continued to}} write novels. [...] From 1961 she [...] rented a summer house at Trevone in Cornwall, which became the setting for her 1962 novel The Weather at Tregulla. She returned to literary criticism after many years, when in 1965 she contributed an essay to Light on C.S. Lewis, a review of that writer's work edited by Jocelyn Gibb. In 1966 she wrote an essay for Punch, [...] "Genesis of a Novel", in which she mused on the detrimental effect of Cold Comfort Farm on her long term career. She likened the book to [...] "some unignorable old uncle, to whom {{you have to be}} grateful because he <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> handsome allowance, but is often an embarrassment and a bore". Gibbons made her last overseas trip in 1966, to Grenoble in France where she visited her old friend Elizabeth Coxhead. This visit provided material for her 1968 novel The Snow Woman in which Gibbons overcame her habitual distaste for emotional excess by opening the book with a melodramatic birth on a sofa. The Woods in Winter (1970) was her last published novel; [...] she decided at that point that she was no longer prepared to subject her work to editorial control. [...] In the 1980s she wrote two more novels for private circulation among friends, The Yellow Houses and An Alpha. These books - An Alpha retitled Pure Juliet - were published by Vintage Classics in 2016, [...] after the manuscripts were released by Gibbons's family.|$|E

500|$|... "Helping Hand" [...] {{received}} overwhelming positive reviews. Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. The best part is, she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship". On this, she said that Bud had some of the best lines in the episode, calling them [...] "the best". She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, she was glad it was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan. Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate. This week, as she saw Megan struggle in her connection with the living, she attempted to reach out and give advice". Of the plot of the episode, Pavlica said; ...|$|E

[...] "Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage," [...] adds Spoto.

I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> great star.

2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
