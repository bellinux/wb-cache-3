40|$|Abstract: The unique dataset from SUPERTANK is {{analyzed}} {{to examine the}} upper limit of beach change in response to elevated water level caused by wave runup. Thirty SUPERTANK runs are investigated, including both erosional and accretionary wave conditions under random and <b>monochromatic</b> <b>waves.</b> The upper limit of beach change approximately equals the maximum vertical excursion of swash runup. Exceptions to this direct relationship are those with beach or dune scarps. The vertical extent of wave runup above mean water level on a non-scarped beach is approximately equal to the significant breaking wave height. Scarps substantially limit the uprush of swash motion, resulting in a much reduced maximum runup. Predictions of wave runup are not improved by including a slope-dependent surf-similarity parameter. The limit of wave runup is substantially less for <b>monochromatic</b> <b>waves</b> than for random waves, attributed to absence of low-frequency motion for <b>monochromatic</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R

The partial differential equations describing the space and time variation of amplitudes and phases are obtained and used to show that both the <b>monochromatic</b> <b>waves</b> and the pure amplitude modulated waves are stable. The spatial attenuation of the pure amplitude modulated waves is found to be lower than that of <b>monochromatic</b> <b>waves,</b> while the temporal attenuation of the former waves has a minimum value near the resonant frequency.
