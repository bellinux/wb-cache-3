5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient,</b> which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
25|$|In 1838, France {{enacted a}} law to {{regulate}} both the admissions into asylums and asylum services across the country. Édouard Séguin developed a systematic approach for training individuals with mental deficiencies, and, in 1839, he opened the first school for the severely retarded. His method of treatment {{was based on the}} assumption that the <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient</b> did not suffer from disease.|$|E
25|$|Knox set out {{to address}} the first problem, in his article {{published}} in the November issue of the New York Medical Journal in 1913. In this paper, he put forth two new performance tests, that were not based on verbal or cultural knowledge. The Cube Imitation Test, also known as Knox Cubes, consisted of four large black cubes and one small black cube. The examiner moves the small cube slowly and deliberately in various patterns {{in relation to the}} larger four cubes. The examinee is asked to imitate the movements conducted by the examiner. Each trial increases in difficulty and complexity. He also introduced a form board test (called the Geographical Puzzle, or “G” Test), which involved fitting pieces into proper places on a board, requiring both motor coordination as well as decision making. He believed that together these two tests could determine with increased accuracy whether an emigrant was <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient,</b> as neither required specific cultural knowledge for successful performance.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} there was a {{movement}} to restrict immigration into the US, as it was widely believed that “morons” or feebleminded individuals were the cause of many societal problems and that border authorities were weakening the nation by allowing far too many of these individuals to enter the country. Ellis Island on New York Harbor was the hub for arrival when the immigration station there was rebuilt in 1900. At first, emigrants were lined up and inspected primarily for medical ailments, initially based on the individual’s overall appearance. More scrutizing inspections were conducted if an individual was flagged for some ailment. For the most part, until this time, any concern regarding mental disorders was limited to psychiatric illnesses. However, as Francis Galton’s ideas regarding eugenics. became more popular in the early 1900s, concerns for that feebleminded individuals were weakening society grew, and mental deficiency among emigrants also became a concern. Another important contributing factor was the development of intelligence tests during this time. Both Alfred Binet and his student Theodore Simon were leaders in this development. Henry Goddard, a prominent eugenicist of the time who had been using Binet and Simon’s scale to measure intelligence in adults, suggested that theses could be used to identify feebleminded or <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient</b> individuals at Ellis Island who posed a threat to the integrity of society. By 1910, the concerns for mentally defective people entering the United States had grown {{to such an extent that}} the officials at Ellis Island invited Henry Goddard to teach the physicians about intelligence testing. However, after spending an entire day there, Goddard had no recommendations for the physicians, as he was impressed by both the size of the problem as well as the physicians ability to detect defect given the number of individuals coming through the immigration station.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{influential}} resource for rationalizing sterilization in the Province of Alberta {{came in the form}} of a mental health survey.

2500|$|William Henry Johnson {{was born}} {{one of six}} {{children}} to a very poor African-American family. His parents were William and Mahalia Johnson, former slaves. As he grew, his body developed normally but his head remained small. His tapering cranium and heavy jaw made him attractive to agents from van Emburgh's Circus in Somerville, New Jersey. His unusual appearance caused many {{to believe that he}} was a [...] "pinhead", or microcephalic. Microcephaly patients are characterized by a small, tapering cranium and often have impaired mental faculty. It is arguable, however, that William Henry was <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While {{walking down}} the street in Chicago, Joseph Schwartz, a retired tailor, is the unwitting victim of a nearby nuclear {{laboratory}} accident, by means of which he is instantaneously transported {{tens of thousands of years}} into the future (50,000 years, by one character's estimate, a figure later retconned by future Asimov works as a [...] "mistake"). He finds himself in a place he does not recognize, and due to apparent changes in the spoken language that far into the future, he is unable to communicate with anyone. He wanders into a farm, and is taken in by the couple that lives there. They mistake him for a <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient</b> person, and they secretly offer him as a subject for an experimental procedure to increase his mental abilities. The procedure, which has killed several subjects, works in his case, and he finds that he can quickly learn to speak the current lingua franca. He also slowly realizes that the procedure has given him strong telepathic abilities, including the ability to project his thoughts to the point of killing or injuring a person.|$|E

60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true; but we, like them, get our {{dividends}} {{whether we}} work or not. We work partly {{because we know}} {{there would be no}} dividends if we did not, and partly because if we refuse we are regarded as <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient</b> and put into a lethal chamber. But what do we work at? Before the few changes we were forced to make by the revolutions that followed the Four Years War, our governing classes had been so rich, as it was called, that they had become the most intellectually lazy and fat-headed people {{on the face of the}} earth. There is a good deal of that fat still clinging to us.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{a common}} phrase, {{recurring}} constantly in the real if rabid eloquence of Victor Hugo, that Napoleon III. was a mere ape of Napoleon I. That is, that he had, as the politician says, in [...] "L'Aiglon," [...] "le petit chapeau, mais pas la tête"; that he was merely a bad imitation. This is extravagantly exaggerative; and those who say it, moreover, often miss {{the two or three}} points of resemblance which really exist in the exaggeration. One resemblance there certainly was. In both Napoleons {{it has been suggested that}} the glory was not so great as it seemed; but in both it can be emphatically added that the eclipse was not so great as it seemed either. Both succeeded at first and failed at last. But both succeeded at last, even after the failure. If at this moment we owe thanks to Napoleon Bonaparte for the armies of united France, we also owe some thanks to Louis Bonaparte for the armies of united Italy. That great movement to a freer and more chivalrous Europe which we call to-day the Cause of the Allies, had its forerunners and first victories before our time; and it not only won at Arcola, but also at Solferino. Men who remembered Louis Napoleon when he mooned about the Blessington salon, and was supposed to be almost <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient,</b> used to say he deceived Europe twice; once when he made men think him an imbecile, and once when he made them think him a statesman. But he deceived them a third time; when he made them think he was dead; and had done nothing.|$|E

Oliver, who owed his appointment solely to his father's great influence, was not only lacking in legal training but apparently <b>mentally</b> <b>deficient</b> and incapable of speech.|$|E
