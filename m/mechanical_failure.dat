50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> {{account for}} about 60% of all drive failures.While the {{eventual}} failure may be catastrophic, most <b>mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> result from gradual wear and there are usually certain indications that failure is imminent. These may include increased heat output, increased noise level, problems with reading and writing of data, or {{an increase in the}} number of damaged disk sectors.|$|R
5|$|On 19 August 2013, B-1B (AF Ser. No. 85-0091) out of Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota {{crashed in}} a remote area near Broadus, Montana. All four crew members survived by {{ejecting}} before the aircraft crashed. A report found that the crash was due to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> leading to a fuel leak and explosions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather had forced the Argentine craft to abandon their original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure,</b> friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E

5|$|Webber again looked {{strong at}} the final race {{of the season in}} Brazil. Webber {{qualified}} fifth in front of both BMW Saubers and behind only the Ferraris and McLarens. Webber looked strong in the race, running as high as fourth, before yet another <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> brought an end to a disappointing but promising season for the Australian.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> {{of the landing}} gear forced an {{emergency}} landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the radio that he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
3000|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>{{failures}}</b> 18 failures {{were reported}} to be in relation to actuator rods becoming loose or not disengaging from limit switches.|$|R

5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011. On 5 November 2013, Taiwan received the first 6 AH-64s. On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E crashed into a three-story building during a training flight in bad weather conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> and concluded human error as responsible, that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led to an early retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been {{closing in on the}} leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E

50|$|By {{the halfway}} point, several cars had dropped out. Greg Ray and Eddie Cheever were out with <b>mechanical</b> <b>failures,</b> and Roberto Guerrero was sidelined with a damaged suspension.|$|R
5|$|Breckinridge's {{performance}} {{earned him}} a promotion to major general on April 14, 1862. After his promotion, he joined Earl Van Dorn near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederate forces awaited a Union attack throughout most of July. Finally, Van Dorn ordered Breckinridge to attempt to recapture Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from federal forces. Despite having his forces reduced to around 3,000 by illness and desertions, on August 5, he attacked the Union garrison, capturing several prisoners, destroying its supplies, and driving it from the city. The ironclad CSS Arkansas was supposed to support Breckinridge's attack, but it was immobilized by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> and its crew sank it to prevent its capture. Without naval support, the Confederates were unable to hold the city.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin entered Formula One, {{the highest}} {{category}} of circuit racing {{defined by the}} Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, with the March team in 1988, as team-mate to Ivan Capelli. He had previously been in contention for a drive with Lotus in 1986 but was overlooked in favour of Johnny Dumfries. The season started badly as Gugelmin suffered five retirements from the first six races due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure,</b> but soon afterwards he took his first points scoring finish with fourth place at the British Grand Prix. Gugelmin scored points in one other race with fifth place at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He finished the season as the highest-scoring newcomer in the Formula One World Championship, ending the year in 13th position overall.|$|E
5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
30|$|The primary outcome {{measures}} were {{the rates of}} (1) reoperation, (2) periprosthetic fracture, and (3) mortality. We additionally isolated reoperation due to nonseptic failure as well as reoperation due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> alone. Nonseptic failures excluded infection as a cause for revision. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> included failures of the implant, such as screw cut-out, loosening, fixation failure, and prominent screws, excluding revision for pain without implant failure. The secondary {{outcome measures}} were (1) blood loss, (2) number of RBC units transfused, (3) number of patients transfused, (4) operative time, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) nonunion, and (7) complications. We isolated complications other than periprosthetic fracture as well as hardware complications specifically. Demographic data were also collected and pooled.|$|R

5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit {{with three or}} four commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit. One of the helicopters was shot down and crash-landed at the stadium, while another had to conduct an emergency landing after suffering a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on tall buildings in the university complex. In {{the early hours of the}} assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to seize control of tall buildings in the university area.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} flank, 2RTR {{advanced}} with the 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received {{of up to}} 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and ASquadron 2RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One Panzer IV was disabled {{and the other two}} driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No2 Troop, destroying a Panzer III and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of ASquadron 2RTR began a reconnaissance patrol towards Sidi Azeiz.|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Thursday before the two races. The session was held on a dry race track upon having dried up from earlier rain. Arthur Pic was the fastest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 20.556 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than Rossi in second. Gasly was third-fastest, ahead of Vandoorne. Sergio Canamasas and Raffaele Marciello were fifth and sixth. Richie Stanaway was seventh-fastest, André Negrão eighth, Haryanto ninth and Norman Nato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Evans caused an brief early red flag period when he stopped his car {{at the top of the}} hall entering Massenet corner, and was unable to set a timed lap. Canamasas went into the Sainte Dévote run-off area, and Marco Sørensen locked his tyres, causing him hit the barriers at Rascasse corner, and reversed out of the turn. Daniël de Jong stopped his car at the Novelle chicane because with a car <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
