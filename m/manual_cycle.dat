The use of fluorescently labeled primers {{eliminates the need for}} radioactively labeled nucleotides, as well as slab gel electrophoresis, and takes advantage of commonly available automated fluorescent capillary electrophoresis instruments. With fluorescently labeled primers and dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing, we have shown that the terminal base of each digested fragment may be accurately identified with a capillary-based instrument. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a 6 FAM-labeled primer to amplify a typical target promoter region. This PCR product was then incubated with a transcriptional activator protein, or bovine serum albumin as a control, and then partially digested with DNase I. A clone of the promoter was sequenced with the Thermo Sequenase Dye Primer <b>Manual</b> <b>Cycle</b> Sequencing kit (USB) and the FAM-labeled primer. Through the use of Genemapper software, the Thermo sequenase and DNasei digestion products were accurately aligned, providing a ready means to assign correct nucleotides to each peak from the DNA footprint. This method was used to characterize the binding of two different transcriptional activator proteins to their respective promoter regions...|$|E

50|$|A ram newly {{placed into}} {{operation}} or which has stopped cycling must be started as follows. If the waste valve {{is in the}} raised (closed) position, which is most common, it must be pushed down manually into the open position and released. If the flow is sufficient, it will then cycle at least once. If it does not continue to cycle, it must be pushed down repeatedly until it cycles continuously on its own, usually after three or four <b>manual</b> <b>cycles.</b> If the ram stops with the waste valve in the down (open) position it must be lifted manually and kept up {{for as long as}} necessary for the supply pipe to fill with water and for any air bubbles to travel up the pipe to the source. This may take a minute or more. Then it can be started manually by pushing it down a few times as described above. Having a valve on the delivery pipe at the ram makes starting easier. Close the valve until the ram starts cycling, then gradually open it to fill the delivery pipe. If opened too quickly it will stop the cycling. Once the delivery pipe is full the valve can be left open.|$|R

40|$|Thesauri and {{similarly}} organised resources attract increasing interest of Natural Language Processing researchers. Thesauri age fast, {{so there is}} a constant need to update their vocabulary. Since a <b>manual</b> update <b>cycle</b> takes considerable time, automated methods are required. This work presents a tuneable method of measuring semantic relatedness, trained on Roget’s Thesaurus, which generates lists of terms related to words not yet in the Thesaurus. Using these lists of terms, we experiment with three methods of adding words to the Thesaurus. We add, with high confidence, over 5500 and 9600 new words and word senses to versions of Roget’s Thesaurus from 1911 and 1987 respectively. We evaluate our work both manually, and by applying the updated thesauri in three NLP tasks: selection of the best synonym from a set of candidates, pseudo-word-sense disambiguation, and SAT-style analogy problems. We find that the newly added words are of high quality. The additions significantly improve the performance of Roget’s -based methods in these NLP tasks. It compares favourably to the performance of WordNet -based methods. Our methods are general enough to work with different versions of Roget’s Thesaurus...|$|R

5000|$|The first manifestation, {{referred}} to as the [...] "Triangular Movement Cycle" [...] or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a <b>manual</b> movement <b>cycle</b> using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student.This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers — and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort — and was very time consuming.|$|R

40|$|The {{sea level}} {{response}} to fluctuations in barometric pressure is currently modelled by the inverted barometer (IB) approximation which implies {{a change of}} approximately 1 cm in sea level for 1 mb change in atmospheric pressure (isostatic assumption). Therefore, sea level gradients perfectly compensate the horizontal gradients in atmospheric pressure fields {{and there is no}} pressure gradient at the sea surface. As a consequence, pressure-induced sea level slopes are not dynamically significant and are usually subtracted from altimetric records of sea surface height. The validity of the IB assumption and the character of the sea level response to barometric forcing is dependant on the time and space scales considered. In this work the magnitude of the Atlantic Ocean response to pressure variations will be quantified, in order to verify the validity of the isostatic assumption. To do that, we will calculate the correlation coefficients () between the sea level anomaly (SLA) and pressure variations (P), which should be approximately- 1 cm/mb if the oceanic response is isostatic. The altimeter data used cover a time period from May 1995 to June 1996 during which ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 satellites were put in the same ground track (the so-called Tandem Mission) with a time lag of approximately one day. Two different techniques will be applied to quantify the coefficients above mentioned, simple regression analysis and empirical orthogonal function decomposition (eofd) analysis. The SLA time series has been produced following the recommendations of the Ocean Product User <b>Manual</b> and <b>cycle</b> validation reports applying the suggested instrumental and geophysical corrections. Apart from that, several corrections have been also applied, such as a new orbital altitude which significantly redu [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Chemical and {{biological}} contaminants can enter a drinking water distribution system {{through one of}} the many access points to the network and can spread quickly affecting a very large area. This is of great concern, and water utilities need to consider effective tools and mitigation strategies to improve water network security. This work presents two components that have been integrated into EPA?s Water Security Toolkit, an open-source software package that includes a set of tools to help water utilities protect the public against potential contamination events. The first component is a novel water quality modeling framework referred to as Merlion. The linear system describing contaminant spread through the network at the core of Merlion provides several advantages and potential uses that are aligned with current emerging water security applications. This computational framework is able to efficiently generate an explicit mathematical model that can be easily embedded into larger mathematical system. Merlion {{can also be used to}} efficiently simulate a large number of scenarios speeding up current water security tools by an order of magnitude. The last component is a pair of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for efficient source inversion and optimal sampling. The contaminant source inversion problem involves determining the source of contamination given a small set of measurements. The source inversion formulation is able to handle discrete positive/negative measurements from manual grab samples taken at different sampling cycles. In addition, sensor/sample placement formulations are extended to determine the optimal locations for the next <b>manual</b> sampling <b>cycle.</b> This approach is enabled by a strategy that significantly reduces the size of the Merlion water quality model, giving rise to a much smaller MILP that is solvable in a real-time setting. The approach is demonstrated on a large-scale water network model with over 12, 000 nodes while considering over 100 timesteps. The results show the approach is successful in finding the source of contamination remarkably quickly, requiring a small number of sampling cycles and a small number of sampling teams. These tools are being integrated and tested with a real-time response system...|$|R
40|$|The Carabidae (Insecta: Coleoptera) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} insect {{families}} in New Zealand with an estimated 600 species, 90 % of which are endemic. Carabids have received a considerable amount of attention in the Northern Hemisphere, but next to nothing is known about the biology of carabids in New Zealand. The aim of my research was to increase our knowledge about the ecology, population dynamics, and life history of carabids in New Zealand native forests. The morphology and biology of two species of endemic carabids, Mecodema oconnori Broun and Megadromus capito (White) was studied in detail. Mecodema oconnori was strongly sexually dimorphic, whereas M. capito males and females were very similar in size and weight. During the course of the study, I discovered several very small M. oconnori males with red legs, and these may belong to a separate species. The habitat use and movement of M. oconnori and M. capito in a native forest remnant was investigated using several different sampling techniques, including manual searches, live capture pitfall trapping, and harmonic radar tracking. Manual searches of carabid resting sites proved to be the most effective method for locating these beetles, as both species displayed a high degree of site fidelity, and were repeatedly found under the same sites. Harmonic radar tracking was not very successful, largely because I was unable to identify beetles when they were in underground burrows. The population dynamics and seasonality of several species of carabids were investigated in order to understand more about their life <b>cycles.</b> <b>Manual</b> searches of resting sites were used to estimate the seasonal abundance of M. oconnori and M. capito throughout the year, and removal pitfall trapping was also carried out for six months. The searches revealed that both M. oconnori and M. capito were present in all months of the year, in contrast to the results from previous pitfall trapping studies. Females of five species of carabids were dissected to investigate their reproductive phenology. Mecodema oconnori had extremely low fecundity, with a mean egg number of only 1. 6 eggs per female. In contrast. M. capito had the highest fecundity, with up to 28 eggs per female. Both M. oconnori and M. capito females contained eggs in their ovaries from October to March, suggesting that these species have a long period of reproductive activity. Megadromus capito larvae were caught in all months of sampling (from October to March) and the three instars overlapped temporally, which implies a long period of larval emergence and development. Megadromus capito larvae were most abundant in January-February and tenerals were found in February and March, suggesting that this species is a spring breeder. Mecodema oconnori also appears to be a spring breeder, although its peak in reproductive activity was slightly later than M. capito, in late spring-summer. The effect of rodent control on carabid beetle assemblages was investigated at Lake Papaitonga Scenic Reserve using paired treatment (poisoned) and non-treatment (non-poisoned) areas. Controlling rodents did not have a significant effect on the carabid assemblages, or on the abundance of other invertebrate taxa, although some carabid species appeared to have benefited from the reduced rodent densities. The abundance of carabids in pitfall traps was significantly correlated with the numbers of amphipods and springtails, which suggests that carabids may aggregate in areas of high prey density. There was also a correlation between carabids and other beetles, but this was more likely to result from a similar response to the environmental characteristics at each trap. There are many questions still to be answered about the habitat use and ecology of carabids in New Zealand, as well as the effects of introduced predators and environmental factors on carabid population dynamics. Longer-term studies are needed to gather more information on the pre-adult stages and reproductive activity of adults, as this is essential to fully understand the life history of New Zealand carabids...|$|R
