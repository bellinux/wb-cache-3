Cousins Idris and Timur return to Afghanistan over two decades later in 2003 to reclaim their family's property. While there, Timur <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> show of publicly distributing money to street beggars while Idris privately bonds with Roshi, an Afghan girl who suffers from a horrific injury and whose family was murdered by her uncle. Idris at first promises to arrange for Roshi to undergo the operations needed for her recovery but distances himself from her and Afghanistan on returning to the States. Several years later, Idris comes across Roshi signing copies of her bestselling memoir, which she has dedicated to her adoptive mother and Timur, who paid for her surgery.|$|E

Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Simpsons episode!"

2500|$|In {{his look}} at the import version, GameSpot's Miguel Lopez called the game [...] "little more than a glorified and highly {{cinematic}} version of Final Fight using dated Tobal animations." [...] He called the graphics [...] "quite competent," [...] but was {{highly critical of the}} game's length, estimating a player could play thought the entire game in forty-five minutes or less, if they skipped cutscenes. In his full review, Jeff Gerstmann scored the game 6.7 out of 10. Of the graphics, he said [...] "Everything, from the characters to the backgrounds, looks absolutely incredible." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Bouncer <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> showpiece for the PlayStation 2. It looks and sounds incredible. However, the ease and extremely short length of the game, matched with other problems like horrific camera angles and lack of a multiplayer story mode, make The Bouncer fair, at best." ...|$|E

[...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny.
