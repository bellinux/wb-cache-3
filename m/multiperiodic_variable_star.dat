Interpretation of the {{available}} ground-based and forthcoming space observations of <b>multiperiodic</b> <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> require accurate computations of oscillation frequencies. Typical rotational equatorial velocities of upper main sequence stars range between 50 and 200 km/s {{and the effect of}} rotation on the oscillation frequencies of these stars must be included. The rotation can still be considered as a perturbation, provided the expansion used in the perturbation method is carried out far enough to provide frequencies accurate enough to match that of the observations. For that purpose, we develop here a perturbation formalism for adiabatic oscillations of moderately rotating stars which is consistently valid up to third order in the rotation rate. The formalism includes the case of near-degeneracy i. e. when the frequencies of two (or three) oscillation modes happen to be close to each other. This occurs systematically for l = 0 and l = 2 p-modes. Near-degeneracy leads to spherical harmonic mixing and affects frequencies. Consequences for mode identification are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{photometric}} data, {{gathered during}} several years, of seven B-type <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> {{that were previously}} discussed by Waelkens and Rufener (1985). It is found that all these <b>stars</b> are <b>multiperiodic</b> <b>variables</b> with periods {{of the order of}} days. For HD 177863, two periods could be identified, for HD 74560 and HD 181558 three periods, for HD 123515 four periods, for HD 74195 five periods, for HD 143309 six periods, and for HD 160124 eight periods. For all stars and all modes, a same dependence of the amplitude on wavelength is found, with amplitudes in the U-bands about twice as large as in the V-band. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{systematic}} search for multiperiodic pulsators among the Galactic Bulge RR Lyrae stars of the OGLE- 1 sample. We identify one "canonical" double-mode <b>variable</b> (RRd <b>star)</b> pulsating in two radial modes. In 38 stars we detect secondary periodicities very close to the primary pulsation frequency. This type of <b>multiperiodic</b> <b>variables</b> constitute ~ 23 % of RRab and ~ 5 % of RRc population of the Bulge. With the observed period ratios of 0. 95 - 1. 02 the secondary periods must correspond to nonradial modes of oscillation. Their beating with the primary (radial) pulsation leads to a long-term amplitude and phase modulation, known as the Blazhko effect. The Blazhko RRab variables occur more frequently in the Galactic Bulge than in the LMC. The opposite tendency is seen in case of the RRd stars. The differences of incidence rates are most likely caused by different metallicity of the two populations. We discuss pulsation properties of the OGLE- 1 Blazhko stars and compare them with predictions of theoretical models. We argue, that the oblique magnetic pulsator model of Shibahashi (2000) cannot account for the observations and should be ruled out.
