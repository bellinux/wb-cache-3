5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E

An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed in utero was observed, but it was based on three cases of almost 800, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of {{an impression of}} the skin covering the dorsal plates has implications for all possible functions of stegosaurian plates. Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) found that the skin was smooth with long, parallel, shallow grooves indicating a keratinous structure covering the plates. The addition of beta-keratin, a strong protein, would indeed allow the plates to bear more weight, suggesting {{they may have been}} used for active defense. A keratinous covering would also allow greater surface area for the plates to be uses as a mating display structures, which could be potentially coloured like the beaks of modern birds. At the same time this finding implies that the use of plates for thermo-regulation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> because the keratinous covering would make heat transfer from the bone highly ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom {{is that if a}} case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is {{based on the idea that}} the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.|$|E

Although the sample was predominantly white (76 %), patients from different ethnicities were represented in the research. Study limitations included reliance on patient self-report and recall bias. The study sample <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> biased toward patients with less severe disease, as patients with severe gastroparesis <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to agree to participate in the research study.|$|R
30|$|Temporary {{employment}} {{might as}} well be an indicator for job quality, but again with ambiguous expectations towards the effect on moonlighting behavior. Since a fixed-term contract might be used for a probationary period with prospects for a permanent follow-up employment, a worker may have an incentive to take strong efforts within that period to signal high productivity. Holding a second job <b>may</b> then <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely.</b> Having a temporary job <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> a demand-side induced outcome of lower productivity. Secondary jobholding <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> used as means of adapting to the possibly low labor market position.|$|R
50|$|Stress {{can also}} be seen to have an {{indirect}} effect on health status. One way this happens is due to the strain on the psychological resources of the stressed individual. Chronic stress is common in those of a low socio-economic status, who are having to balance worries about financial security, how they will feed their families, housing status, and many other concerns. Therefore, individuals with these kinds of worries may lack the emotional resources to adopt positive health behaviours. Chronically stressed individuals <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> able to prioritise their health.|$|R
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely.</b> A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E

500|$|Feldman {{noted that}} the advent of online support groups, {{combined}} with access to vast stores of medical information, enabled [...] individuals seeking to gain sympathy by relating a series of harrowing medical or psychological problems that defy comprehension to misuse the groups. Communication forums specializing in medical or psychological recovery were established to give lay users support in navigating often confusing and frustrating medical processes and bureaucracy. Communities often formed on those forums, {{with the goal of}} sharing information to help other members. Medical websites also became common, giving lay users access to literature {{in a way that was}} accessible to those without specific medical training. As Internet communication grew in popularity, users began to forgo the doctors and hospitals often consulted for medical advice. Frequenting virtual communities that have experience with a medical problem, Feldman notes, is easier than going through the physical pain or illness that would be necessary before visiting a doctor to get the attention sought. By pretending to be gravely ill, Internet users can gain sympathy from a group whose sole reason for existence is support. [...] Health care professionals, with their limited time, greater medical knowledge, and tendency to be more skeptical in their diagnoses, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to provide that support.|$|E

To study these distinctions, we present scalable, high-quality annotation schemes for event de-tection and fine-grained factuality assess-ment. We find that non-experts, with very little training, can reliably provide judgments about what events are men-tioned {{and the extent to which}} the author thinks they actually happened. We also show how such data enables the develop-ment of regression models for fine-grained scalar factuality predictions that outper-form strong baselines. ...|$|R

It's unlikely that he will waste time complaining because he was informed of his estimated wait and presented with options for managing his time.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of an {{investigation}} into the implementation of Children First, National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which was published in 1999. Individual complaints to the Ombudsman for Children can highlight a deficiency in policy, practice or legislation. In this case the investigation was conducted under section 10 of the Act which provides that I can initiate an investigation of my own motion. Own motion investigations are particularly useful where, as in this case, children and families who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to make a complaint. This is also the first systemic investigation carried out by the Ombudsman for Children’s Office. By definition this recognises the Ombudsman’s potential to induce broader change in the administrative system that benefits more than one individual child. Some of the conclusions in this report are positive. It is recognised that substantial efforts have been made at various times since 1999 to implement Children First. However, some of its conclusions are negative and a number of findings of unsound administration have been made...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles underlying neuroplasticity {{is based on the}} idea that individual synaptic connections are constantly being removed or recreated, largely dependent upon the activity of the neurons that bear them. The activity-dependence of synaptic plasticity is captured in the aphorism which is often used to summarize Hebbian theory: [...] "neurons that fire together, wire together"/"neurons that fire out of sync, fail to link".

2500|$|Internationally {{depression}} {{as well as}} {{distress in}} medical school is widely studied and gained more attention over the years.

[...] In a South Korean study, 40% of medical students appeared to have depression. Medical students with more severe depression also <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to seek treatment, largely from fear that faculty members would view them as being unable to handle their responsibilities.

50|$|Some gender discrimination, whether {{intentional}} or not, also effects {{the positions}} students may strive {{for in the}} future.

This is because interactions within the school and society are pushing them towards easier, more feminine classes, such as home economics or art. They also might not see many other women going into the STEM field. This then lowers the number of women in STEM, further producing and continuing this cycle. This also has a similar effect on males. Because of interactions from teachers, such as saying boys do not usually cook, males <b>may</b> then <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to follow careers such as a chef, an artist, or a writer.|$|R

2500|$|Antidepressant {{discontinuation}} {{syndrome is}} an adverse effect of second generation anti-depressants, including fluoxetine. The symptoms appear with rapid discontinuation {{of one of}} these drugs, and can include dizziness, disturbance of balance, headache, nausea, insomnia, and vivid dreams. Others can include sensations of tingling or numbness, ‘electric-shock’-like sensations, and irritability, with some case reports of hallucinations. [...] They can generally be prevented by tapering off the drug over a period of four weeks, although evidence is weak for optimal tapering and there is disagreement between experts over the schedule. If a person is informed of the risk of discontinuation syndrome prior to starting the drug and again prior to beginning any tapering, discontinuation symptoms appear to be fewer and less severe, but again evidence is weak.

40|$|Many studies {{conclude}} {{there is}} a strong relationship between moral reasoning and illegal behaviour amongst young offenders. However, there has been no research examining this relationship amongst people with intellectual disabilities. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that the relationship between moral reasoning and illegal behaviour <b>may</b> <b>be</b> curvilinear, such that lower moral reasoning and higher moral reasoning relates to lower rates of illegal behaviour and inappropriate conduct. Given this, and evidence that people with intellectual disabilities are reasoning at a lower moral stage than their same-age peers, it is proposed that some people with intellectual disabilities <b>may</b> actually <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in illegal behaviour because they are reasoning at an earlier moral stage, while those with ‘borderline’ intelligence {{would be more likely to}} engage in illegal behaviour.
