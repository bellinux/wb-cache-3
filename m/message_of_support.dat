5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was made towards him.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds {{police and the}} Director of Public Prosecutions under the Vagrancy Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited by a local school group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as he was not the publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E

500|$|Regarding religion, Murphy had {{previously}} been verging on agnostic, but confirmed his atheism after researching {{his role as a}} nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film Sunshine. He was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.

500|$|Discussion has {{centered}} on such themes as the conflict between modern human and nature, and the film's treatment of imperialism, racism, militarism and patriotism, corporate greed, property rights, spirituality and religion. [...] Commentators have debated whether the film's treatment of the human aggression against the native Na'vi is a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for indigenous peoples today, or is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage. [...] Right-wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an [...] "anti-American" [...] message in the film's depiction of a private military contractor that used ex-Marines to attack the natives, while Cameron and others argued that it is pro-American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] The visual similarity between {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists. [...] Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today.|$|E

500|$|Many {{commentators}} saw {{the film}} as a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the struggles of native peoples today. Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, praised Avatar for its [...] "profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle {{for the defense of}} nature". Others compared the human invaders with [...] "NATO in Iraq or Israel in Palestine", and considered it reassuring that [...] "when the Na'vi clans are united, and a sincere prayer is offered, the... 'primitive savages' win the war." [...] Palestinian activists painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na'vi during their weekly protest in the village of Bilin against Israel's separation barrier. [...] Other Arab writers, however, noted that [...] "for Palestinians, Avatar is rather a reaffirmation and confirmation of the claims about their incapability to lead themselves and build their own future." [...] Forbes columnist Reihan Salam criticized the vilification of capitalism in the film, asserting that it represents a more noble and heroic way of life than that led by the Na'vi, because it [...] "give everyone an opportunity to learn, discover, and explore, and to change the world around us." [...] Si Sheppard on the other hand praised the film for drawing parallels between the corporate imperialism of the fictional RDA and its historical equivalents of the pre-industrial era (specifically the East India Company, which maintained its own private army in order to impose profit-driven territorial sovereignty at the expense of indigenous peoples).|$|E
