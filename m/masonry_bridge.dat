40|$|Repairs to <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are often}} {{undertaken}} by pointing and grouting with Portland cements. As an emminently hydraulic binder, Portland cement is resistant to dissolution in aggressive environments {{such as those}} of <b>bridges.</b> However, most <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> in Europe were built with hydraulic lime mortars, their degree of hydraulicity ranging from feeble to eminent, and due to their lime binder, added pozzolans, or the natural aggregate used for their fabrication. Artificial cements can be incompatible with masonry materials. Common problems at <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> include binder dissolution, defective bond, leaching and salt damage. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assist in the design of repair mortars for <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges,</b> focusing on the importance of selecting quality materials compatible with existing fabrics. This is achieved by studying the influence of mortars on masonry structures, the properties and composition of mortars used in the construction of bridges and the problems associated with them. Analytical and experimental results are combined with today’s most widely accepted conservation theory in order to set out the parameters needed for the design of compatible, quality, durable repair mortars.

40|$|How {{long can}} {{existing}} <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> continue to carry heavily increased traffic loading? Is there a weight limit for <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> below which no long-term damage will occur to the structure? Can {{the life expectancy}} for <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> be estimated? The present report attempts to explore {{some of these questions}} and suggest a framework to incorporate long-term life-cycle assessment into the thinking process. While the fatigue behaviour of metals and metallic structures has been widely studied, little information exists on the fatigue behaviour of masonry structures. There are no specific guidelines available to assess the fatigue limit and residual life expectancy of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges.</b> Similarly to any material, masonry also deteriorates under long-term fatigue loading. The majority of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> were built over 100 years ago and carry far greater traffic loading than they were originally designed for. Although <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> do not generally collapse or suffer visible fatigue damage, they may suffer localised deterioration under long-term service loading. Even if the ultimate capacity is not reached, localised deterioration can lead to changes in the load path and to accelerated deterioration of the overall structure. Failure under long-term cyclic loading can be different from the failure mode associated with quasi-static loading. While four-hinge mechanism is the typical failure mode under quasi-static loading, multi-ring arches are more likely to fail by ring separation under cyclic loading. Although available test data is insufficient to quantify the long-term cyclic capacity of the wide range of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges,</b> the report seeks to raise awareness of potential issues associated with long-term cyclic loading and provide a methodology for identifying the remaining service life and residual capacity for <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges.</b> Assessing the impact of long-term cyclic loading on <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> seeks to identify -	safe long-term loading limits -	expected service life -	likely forms of deterioration over time -	future strengthening needs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> {{are crucial}} {{elements}} in the railway transportation network throughout Europe. Although significant advances in seismic risk assessment of various bridge types {{have been made by}} developing fragility curves of generalized classes of structures, there are no comparable tools for masonry arch structures. In this context, this paper presents the construction of seismic fragility curves of single-span <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> according to the limit analysis method. An iterative procedure is implemented to define the capacity curve of the equivalent single degree of freedom system through non-linear kinematic analysis. The process involves determination of the collapse mechanism, calculation of the limit load multiplier, and definition of the thrust line. The intrinsic variability of the seismic action is incorporated with the use of different sets of elastic spectra compatible with EC 8 Type- 1 spectrum for various types of soil, with peak ground acceleration varying over the range 0. 05 - 1. 5 g. The fragility curves of the generalized classes of single-span <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> are finally obtained from the effective ranges of the main geometric and material parameters affecting arch bridge capacity...|$|R

Monitoring and material characterization are standard procedures in safety assessment and, will be shown that Bayesian techniques are a useful tool to incorporate new gathered information in structural analysis model.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} seismic {{vulnerability assessment}} of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> with common typologies in Europe. Bridges are, in most cases, {{the most vulnerable}} elements in the transportation network during an earthquake; therefore, their seismic vulnerability assessment is necessary for a proper planning of the emergency phase and to define a priority for retrofit interventions. <b>Masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> were subdivided into homogeneous classes of single span and multi-span structures, according to {{the result of a}} statistical analysis made up of a large stock of 757 railway bridges located in high seismic areas. All the different collapse mechanisms for seismic action were studied for each class of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> with application of limit analysis and the calibration with FEM. In particular, limit analysis methods for the seismic assessment of single and multi spans bridges were developed. A innovative limit analysis approach was proposed for the assessment of the global transverse seismic capacity of multi-span <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> with slender piers. Envelope curves representing the seismic capacity expressed in terms of limit horizontal acceleration were derived by parametrical analysis by means of simplified limit analysis. These curves can be used for a simplified vulnerability assessment of <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridges</b> and for a simple calibration of the judgment obtained by BMS through inspection visits to bridges. In {{the second part of the}} study, a new simplified approach for the fast calculation of seismic fragility curves of numerous <b>masonry</b> arch <b>bridge</b> clusters is proposed. The aim of this thesis is to propose a quickly procedure to estimate the seismic vulnerability of extended roadway and railway bridge networks in emergency conditions and to optimize the retrofit interventions...|$|R

Many of these bridges are relatively old and are still in service in their original configuration.

Most experimental work and assessment methods have so far been carried out under ultimate load. Only limited work has been undertaken to date on serviceability assessment methods, this project therefore aims to develop a systematic method to assess the serviceability load of <b>masonry</b> <b>bridges</b> under a series of different serviceability criteria.
