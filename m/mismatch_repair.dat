5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair,</b> which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> (MMR) {{machinery}} offers inherent {{protection to}} the cell against nucleotide base mismatch. Therefore, any mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides can be targeted by the MMR. There {{are several ways to}} avoid this. First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> is to bury the mutations of interest within other silent mutations. Since silent mutations do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery. The presence of modified bases will also help to evade the MMR machinery because they are not recognized. Finally, long segments of mutations will be less affected by short segments of mutations.|$|E
25|$|Among 68 {{sporadic}} colon cancers {{with reduced}} {{expression of the}} DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> protein MLH1, most {{were found to be}} deficient due to epigenetic methylation of the CpG island of the MLH1 gene. However, up to 15% of MLH1-deficiencies in sporadic colon cancers appeared to be due to over-expression of the microRNA miR-155, which represses MLH1 expression.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{alterations}} (epimutations) in base {{excision repair}} genes {{have only recently}} begun to be evaluated in a few cancers, compared to the numerous previous studies of epimutations in genes acting in other DNA repair pathways (such as MLH1 in <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> and MGMT in direct reversal).

50|$|Mismatches {{commonly}} {{occur as}} a result of DNA replication errors, genetic recombination, or other chemical and physical factors. Recognizing those <b>mismatches</b> and <b>repairing</b> them is extremely important for cells, because failure to do so results in microsatellite instability, an elevated spontaneous mutation rate (mutator phenotype), and susceptibility to HNPCC.hMSH6 combines with hMSH2 to form the active protein complex, hMutS alpha, also called hMSH2-hMSH6.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{identified}} an alternative pathway of tumorigenesis in sporadic colon cancer, involving microsatellite instability due to <b>mismatched</b> <b>repair</b> methylation, {{which may be}} driven by mutations in the BRAF gene (V 600 E). Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is the most common}} cancer in the world, and African Americans show a higher incidence than other populations in the United States. We analyzed sporadic CRCs in Omani (of African origin, N = 61), Iranian (of Caucasian origin, N = 53) and African American (N = 95) patients for microsatellite instability, expression status of <b>mismatched</b> <b>repair</b> genes (hMLH 1, hMSH 2) and presence of the BRAF (V 600 E) mutation. In the Omani group, all tumors with BRAF mutations were located in {{the left side of the}} colon, and for African Americans, 88 % 7 of tumors with BRAF mutations were found in the right side of the colon. In African Americans, 31 % of tumors displayed microsatellite instability at two or more markers (MSI-H), while this rate was 26 % and 13 % for tumors in the Iranian and Omani groups, respectively. A majority of these MSI-H tumors were located in the proximal colon (right side) in African American and Iranian subjects, whereas most were located in the distal colon (left side) in Omani subjects. Defects in hMLH 1 gene expression were found in 77 % of MSI-H tumors in both African Americans and Iranians and in 38 % of tumors in Omanis. BRAF mutations were observed in all subjects: 10 % of tumors in African Americans (8 / 82), 2 % of tumors in Iranians (1 / 53), and 19 % of tumors in Omanis (11 / 59). Our findings suggest that CRC occurs at a younger age in Omani and Iranian patients, and these groups showed a lower occurrence of MSI-H than did African American patients. Our multivariate model suggests an important and significant role of hMLH 1 expression and BRAF mutation in MSI-H CRC in these populations. The high occurrence of MSI-H tumors in African Americans may have significant implications for treatment, since patients with MSI-H lesions display a different response to chemotherapeutic agents such as 5 -fluorouracil. </p...|$|R

25|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair is a DNA repair mechanism. There are three {{excision repair}} pathways: nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> (MMR). In NER, the damaged DNA strand is removed and the undamaged strand is kept as {{a template for}} the formation of a complementary sequence with DNA polymerase. DNA ligase joins the strands together to form dsDNA. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).|$|E
25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be a factor in colorectal cancer as well as other cancers with microsatellite instability. As stated previously, frameshift mutations are more likely to occur in a region of repeat sequence. When DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> does not fix the addition or deletion of bases, these mutations {{are more likely to be}} pathogenic. This may be in part because the tumor is not told to stop growing. Experiments in yeast and bacteria help to show characteristics of microsatellites that may contribute to defective DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair.</b> These include the length of the microsatellite, the makeup of the genetic material and how pure the repeats are. Based on experimental results longer microsatellites have a higher rate of frameshift mutations. The flanking DNA can also contribute to frameshift mutations. In prostate cancer a frameshift mutation changes the open reading frame (ORF) and prevents apoptosis from occurring. This leads to an unregulated growth of the tumor. While there are environmental factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer, there is also a genetic component. During testing of coding regions to identify mutations, 116 genetic variants were discovered, including 61 frameshift mutations. There are over 500 mutations on chromosome 17 that seem to play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are frameshift.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{believed that there}} were two major pathways in colorectal cancer formation. The first was a chromosomal instability pathway thought to be responsible for the adenoma to carcinoma progression, which was characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q, 17p and 18q. The second pathway was believed to be the microsatellite instability pathway, which is characterized by increases or decreases in the number of tandem repeats of simple DNA sequences. This type of instability is associated with some specific mutations, including genes involved with DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> and surprisingly, transforming growth factor-beta. More recently, those in the field of colorectal cancer have acknowledged that cancer formation is far more complex, but cancer related genes still tend to be categorized as chromosomal or microsatellite instability genes.|$|E
5000|$|DDP {{has been}} criticised {{for the lack}} of a {{comprehensive}} manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned. Although non-verbal communication, communicative <b>mismatch</b> and <b>repair,</b> playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making [...] "a real logical jump" [...] in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing and <b>repairing</b> <b>mismatches</b> and indels is {{important}} for cells because {{failure to do so}} results in microsatellite instability (MSI) and an elevated spontaneous mutation rate (mutator phenotype). In comparison to other cancer types, MMR-deficient (MSI) cancer has a very high frequency of mutations, close to melanoma and lung cancer, cancer types caused by much exposure to UV radiation and mutagenic chemicals.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY MTS {{is defined}} {{by at least one}} sebaceous gland adenoma and one {{internal}} malignancy. Malignancies are often multiple with predominance of colorectal and urogenital carcinomas. Half of the patients with colorectal cancer have at least one synchronous or metachronous lesion. The skin lesions may be the first sign of this syndrome, although more often its cutaneous signs follow the diagnosis of at least the first visceral malignancy. Identifying such patients will affect their management. Regular follow-up and search for new malignancy is mandatory. Because this syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, identifying one patient means delineating an entire family, which should then be investigated. This syndrome may be caused by a defective <b>mismatch</b> DNA <b>repair</b> gene...|$|R
25|$|A {{strong family}} history of endometrial cancer, colon cancer, or other {{gastrointestinal}} cancers may indicate {{the presence of a}} syndrome known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch syndrome), which confers a higher risk for developing a number of cancers, including ovarian cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> genes, including MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1, and PMS2. The risk of ovarian cancer for an individual with Lynch syndrome is between 10 and 12 percent. People of Icelandic descent, European Jewish descent/Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and Hungarian descent are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer. Estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) seems to be a key to pathogenesis and response to therapy. Other genes that have been associated with ovarian cancer are BRIP1, MSH6, RAD51C and RAD51D. CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD50 have also been associated with ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|The major genetic {{risk factor}} for ovarian cancer is a {{mutation}} in BRCA1 or BRCA2 DNA <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair</b> genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one allele need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable penetrance. Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%. Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15–45%. Mutations in BRCA2 are less risky than those with BRCA1, with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited). On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts, because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.|$|E
25|$|Methylation of {{cytosine}} to form 5-methylcytosine {{occurs at}} the same 5 position on the pyrimidine ring where the DNA base thymine's methyl group is located, distinguishing thymine from the analogous RNA base uracil which has no methyl group. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G <b>mismatch.</b> <b>Repair</b> mechanisms may then correct {{it back to the}} original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute G for A, turning the original C:G pair into an A:T pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation. This misincorporated base will not be corrected during DNA replication as thymine is a DNA base. If the mismatch is not repaired and the cell enters the cell cycle the strand carrying the T will be complemented by an A in one of the daughter cells, such that the mutation becomes permanent. The near-universal replacement of uracil by thymine in DNA, but not RNA, may have evolved as an error-control mechanism, to facilitate removal of uracils generated by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine.|$|E

The entire guanine ring moves slightly toward the platinum site, into the major groove. Only three of the eight potential cisplatin binding sites on guanines actually are occupied, and this differential reactivity can be {{explained in terms of}} the relative freedom of motion of guanines toward the major groove.

40|$|Sulfur mustard, bis([beta]-chloroethyl) sulfide (BCES), a bifunctional alkylating agent, is a {{vesicant}} whose mode {{of action}} involves interference with the integrity of cellular DNA.

Another possible mechanism by which BCES could exert its toxic effect is interference with high fidelity repair of damaged DNA. This study evaluated the possible effects of BCES on the repair of specific errors, i. e., mismatched bases, in the DNA. Heteroduplex (ht) DNA, formed between two temperature-sensitive mutants of SV 40 virus, tsA 239 and tsA 255, each having a different point mutation in the gene for large T antigen, was used to study the effect of BCES on <b>mismatched</b> base <b>repair</b> in African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells. AGMK cells were exposed to dilute solutions of BCES in methylene chloride (MC) prior to cationic lipofection with ht DNA. In order for the cells to produce wild type (wt) SV 40 DNA at a nonpermissive temperature (41 [deg]C), repair of {{at least one of the}} two mismatches in the DNA had to occur. It was observed that (a) as the concentration of BCES was increased, a proportionally longer delay in the appearance of wt DNA at 41 [deg]C was observed in treated cells transfected with ht DNA as compared with cultures exposed to MC alone and then transfected with ht DNA, (b) there was no such effect in exposed AGMK cells transfected with wt DNA, (c) wt and ht DNA were transfected at similar rates in unexposed cells, and (d) BCES did not affect the rate of transfection of wt cells.

25|$|While epigenetics is of {{fundamental}} importance in eukaryotes, especially metazoans, it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make {{widespread use of}} postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair,</b> packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression. There exists a genetic switch controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could {{pave the way to}} improved vaccines. Each form is randomly generated by a phase variable methylation system. The ability of the pneumococcus to cause deadly infections is different in each of these six states. Similar systems exist in other bacterial genera.|$|E
25|$|E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) is {{an enzyme}} of ~32 kDa {{that does not}} belong to a restriction/modification system. The target {{recognition}} sequence for E. coli Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA–Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including <b>mismatch</b> <b>repair,</b> the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the E. coli genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.|$|E

Balanced against its regulatory usefulness at some sites is the mutational risk it imposes upon the cell. Deamination of m 5 C can lead to its replacement by thymine (T). One possible role for excess methylation is strand discrimination in the <b>repair</b> of <b>mismatches.</b> We constructed the complementary hemimethylated single-base-pair mismatches, G T and A C, at a CG site in simian virus 40 DNA, transfected these into the host African green monkey kidney cells (CV- 1), and examined DNA of the progeny for repair at this site. Hemimethylation at two Hha I sites (Gm 5 CGC) bracketing the <b>mismatch</b> directed <b>repair</b> to occur only on the unmethylated strand. Methylation at the multiple Cm 5 CATGG and Gm 6 ATC sites, a pattern normally seen in bacteria, also instructed repair to proceed on the unmethylated strand, although less efficiently. Hemimethylation at only one site, adjacent to the mispaired bases (Hpa II, Cm 5 CGG) produced repaired molecules in a ratio that may represent random repair of the A C <b>mismatch</b> and strand-directed <b>repair</b> in the complementary G T mismatch. The -mCG- -GT- mismatch could result from deamination of m 5 C in the most commonly methylated dinucleotide in vertebrates, CpG.
