5|$|On his deathbed, the King of Fynn tasks {{the party}} to seek {{the help of the}} {{seemingly}} extinct dragoons of Deist. In Deist, the party finds only a mother with her son, learning that {{all but one of the}} Dragoons are dead, partly as a result of Imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last wyvern in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and rescues Hilda from the Empire a second time, before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the Imperial forces. They then travel west in search of a powerful <b>magic</b> <b>item,</b> joining forces with the last surviving dragoon on the way. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a cyclone summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Back at Fynn, everyone celebrates the Empire's defeat, but a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the Rebels with the Imperial army.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a <b>magic</b> <b>item</b> resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E
500|$|The {{fifth and}} final card {{selected}} determines Strahd's motivation. There are four possible motivations for Strahd. He {{may want to}} replace one of the PCs and attempt to turn the character into a vampire and take on that character's form. He may desire the love of Ireena, whose appearance matches that of his lost love, Tatyana. Using mind control, Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by [...] "saving" [...] her from the situation he created. Strahd {{may also want to}} create an evil <b>magic</b> <b>item,</b> or destroy the Sunsword. If, during play, the party's fortune is told at the gypsy camp in Barovia, the random elements are altered to match the cards drawn by the gypsy.|$|E

500|$|A {{review by}} Graham Staplehurst in White Dwarf magazine, issue #60, gave the module an 8 out of 10 overall, {{and noted that}} the lack of things such as gold and clerics in the {{adventure}} world [...] "don't destroy the feel of the scenario, whilst creating a very novel atmosphere". Staplehurst felt that the adventure was [...] "...very much taken off from Lord of the Rings with a powerful <b>magic</b> <b>item</b> to be taken at all costs to the aggressor's innermost defences and through them. The characters will have to get past a nice new race of humanoids as well as a couple of other monster-concepts. The artwork (aside from the cover) is good and usable in the adventure. Another good product." ...|$|E
