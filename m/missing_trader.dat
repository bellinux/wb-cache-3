5000|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud (also called <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> intra-community, MTIC, or {{carousel}} fraud) is {{the theft}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) from a government by organised crime gangs who exploit the way VAT is treated within multi-jurisdictional trading where the movement of goods between jurisdictions is VAT-free. This allows the fraudster (person who commits fraud) to charge VAT {{on the sale of}} goods, and then instead of paying this over to the government's collection authority, to simply abscond, taking the VAT with him. The term [...] "missing trader" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} trader goes missing with the VAT. [...] "Carousel" [...] refers to a more complex type of fraud in which VAT and goods are passed around between companies and jurisdictions, similar to how a carousel goes round and round.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} value added tax evasions on the fuel {{market in the}} Czech Republic. This {{commodity}} is used in carousel fraud. In the chains of taxpayers there are <b>missing</b> <b>traders</b> who fail to meet their tax obligations. Their business strategy is based on quick sales at unusually low prices which do not allow honest parties to compete. Tax administrators should focus on unusual prices which constitute a higher probability of tax evasions. This paper aims to verify {{whether or not there}} are ways to evade the measure, focusing specifically on applying methods which could help achieve lower sales prices while avoiding the possibility to require unpaid tax from the recipients of taxable supply. The weaknesses thus found are described and demonstrated in more detail in the paper. During a research some ways were found which could be used for avoiding this specific measure. Methods of Cash Back and Free Shipping were identified and described...|$|R
60|$|I {{really do}} not know who says that the prehistoric {{ancestors}} of Aryans and Semites were once in the same stage as the 'negroes of the West Coast of Africa are to-day.' These honest fellows are well acquainted with coined money, {{with the use of}} firearms, and other resources of civilisation, and have been in touch with missionaries, <b>Miss</b> Kingsley, <b>traders,</b> and tourists. The ancestors of the Aryans and Semites enjoyed no such advantages. Mr. Max Muller does not tell us who says that they did. But that the ancestors of all mankind passed through a stage in which they had to develop for themselves tools, languages, clothes, and institutions, is assuredly the belief of anthropologists. A race without tools, language, clothes, pottery, and social institutions, or with these in the shape of undeveloped speech, stone knives, and 'possum or other skins, is what we call a race of savages. Such we believe the ancestors of mankind to have been--at any rate after the Fall.|$|R

50|$|The RCPO handled {{approximately}} 2,500 cases each year. In {{its first}} six months, RCPO concluded 858 cases convictions in 88% of cases. It deals with cases of fraud {{in relation to}} direct taxes (income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, corporation tax) and indirect taxes (mainly VAT - notably multimillion-pound <b>Missing</b> <b>Trader</b> Intra-Community ("carousel") frauds), tax credits, drug smuggling, and money laundering, cases involving United Nations trade sanctions, conflict diamonds and CITES. The majority of cases involved drug trafficking prosecutions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} {{carousel}} fraud (also known as <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud) has increased. Criminal gangs trade goods, such as mobile phones, across EU countries. They {{do not have}} to pay VAT, as imports from the EU are not subject to VAT in the UK. The fraud occurs when the criminals sell the goods with VAT in the UK but fail to pass the VAT to HMRC. The goods are often repeatedly shipped round EU countries by criminal gang networks, hence the [...] "carousel" [...] name. According to the HMRC, between £1.1bn and £1.9bn tax revenue was lost in 2004/05 due to carousel fraud. The European Union Emission Trading Scheme has been plagued by carousel fraud.|$|E
5000|$|In terminology, each {{business}} {{described above}} {{is called a}} [...] "buffer". In a real case there can be many buffers, all helping to blur {{the link between the}} final reclaim and the original importer, which will vanish. Buffer is what these companies are, but they are actually referred to as a number. A number 1 is always the importer. In addition banks are used to make 3rd party payments. These obscure banks are called [...] "platforms" [...] and work on the escrow principle. This means money is uploaded and transferred immediately through the client accounts and it takes a day for the money {{to come out of the}} platform. The biggest platform was First Curaçao International Bank (FCIB) which was closed by the Netherlands authorities in 2006. Using these offshore platforms means that authorities cannot trace the money until they inspect books and as the <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> has already fled they don't get to see where the money has been routed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> {{fraud is}} where a fraudster imports some goods. The goods were zero-rated {{in the country of}} origin, and VAT on the goods should be paid in the country where they have been imported. After importing, the fraudster sells the goods to another trader charging the price of the goods plus VAT, but doesn't pass on the VAT to the Government. He becomes a [...] "missing trader". The buyer which has paid the VAT to the fraudster, can deduct the same VAT amount on his VAT return. Afterwards, the same goods will be zero-rated for export. This way, the Government has lost the entire VAT that should be paid on the goods, rather than the fraction of it that would be paid for just one stage of the production process. This situation, where the goods are made available for consumers in the importer's home market is often known as 'acquisition fraud'.|$|E
5000|$|A devastating {{terrorist}} strike wipes {{out much}} of Saudi Arabia's oil production; {{the same day}} a trader of Saudi origin disappears from the fictional UK investment bank Sun First Credit (SFCB). Managers soon discover the <b>missing</b> <b>trader,</b> Samir Badr, has built up crippling debts, multiplied a hundredfold by the attacks in Saudi. SFCB, once the toast of the city, is suddenly heading for bankruptcy, taking a whole raft of other banks with it. The resulting market crash and banking crisis will push Britain and the US into a 21st Century recession: pension funds are slashed, unemployment soars and the housing market collapses. Following the discovery that Badr has committed suicide, a new Al-Qa'eda tape surfaces, in which Osama Bin Laden appears to claim responsibility for the financial turmoil. Suspicion grows that Badr was an Islamic extremist who deliberately sabotaged the bank. As the authorities and the media launch a massive investigation into the apparent Al-Qaeda assault on the pillars of the Western Economy, an alternative explanation emerges. Could greed and incompetence be the real cause {{of the collapse of}} Britain's economy? ...|$|E

5000|$|Bilta (UK) Ltd ("Bilta"), {{a company}} {{incorporated}} in England, seeks through its joint liquidators, Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram, to recover damages or equitable compensation {{in respect of}} its alleged loss. As against the directors, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty. The conspiracy {{is alleged to have}} been an unlawful means conspiracy, and the unlawful means are the directors' alleged breach of their fiduciary duties. As against Jetivia and Mr Brunschweiler, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or compensation for dishonest assistance in the directors' breach of their fiduciary duties. Since the matter comes before the court on Jetivia's and Mr Brunschweiler's application for the claims against them to be summarily struck out or dismissed, it is to be assumed for present purposes that the factual allegations made in Bilta's amended particulars of claim are capable of proof, and {{there is no need to}} repeat the word [...] "alleged" [...] whenever referring to the defendants' conduct. The liquidators also pursue a separate claim for fraudulent trading under section 213 of IA 1986. Jetivia is a Swiss company and Mr Brunschweiler, who is resident in France, is its sole director.Bilta had two directors, Mr Nazir and Mr Chopra ("the directors"), who are the first and second defendants. Mr Chopra owned all the issued shares. Bilta was registered for the purposes of VAT. Its only trading activity, which took place between 22 April and 21 July 2009, was trading in European Emissions Trading Scheme Allowances ("EUAs"), which are commonly known as carbon credits. EUAs were treated as taxable supplies under the VAT Act 1994 until 31 July 2009. Since then they have been zero-rated. The VAT status of supplies of the EUAs at the relevant time explains Bilta's activities.In short, Bilta bought large numbers of EUAs from overseas suppliers, including Jetivia, free of VAT, and sold them in the UK with VAT to companies described as [...] "first line buffers", which immediately sold them on. The price for which Bilta sold the EUAs was lower before VAT than the price at which it bought, and Bilta was therefore never going to be in a position to meet its liabilities to HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"). Bilta had minimal capital and was insolvent virtually from the outset. The money payable to Bilta, including the VAT due to HMRC, was either paid to Bilta and paid on by it to its overseas supplier, or was paid by the first line buffer (or a later company in the chain) directly to Bilta's supplier, or was otherwise paid to offshore accounts. At the end of the chain the EUAs would be resold to a company outside the UK, generating a right to a VAT refund. It is a familiar kind of carousel or <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud.Bilta was insolvent throughout the period of its trading in EUAs. In that three-month period, Bilta sold more than 5.7m EUAs for about £294m. Its liability for VAT on those transactions amounts to £38,733,444. It did not submit any VAT returns to HMRC. On the application of HMRC Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram were appointed provisional liquidators of Bilta on 29 September 2009. They commenced the company's claim against the defendants who were its directors and other parties, including the appellants. The company was compulsorily wound up on 25 November 2009. The proceedings were amended on 13 October 2011 to include the liquidators' claims under section 213 of IA 1986.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to show {{evidence}} and to quantify with forensic econometric methods the impact of the <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud on European carbon allowances markets. This fraud occurred mainly between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009. In this paper we explore the financial mechanisms of the fraud and the impact on the market behaviour as well as the consequences on its econometric features. halshs- 00523512, version 1 - 5 Oct 2010 Design/methodology/approach – In a previous work (Frunza and Guégan, 2010), we showed that the European carbon market is strongly influenced by fundamentals factors as oil, energy, gas, coal and equities. Therefore, we calibrated Arbitrage Pricing Theory-like models. These models enabled us to quantify the impact of each factor on the market. In this study, we focused more precisely on spot prices quoted on Paris based Bluenext market over 2008 and 2009. We observed during this period a significant drop in performances and robustness of our model and a reduced sensitivity of carbon prices to fundamentals. Findings – Therefore, we identify the period where the market was driven by <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud movements and we were able to measure the value of this fraud. Soon after governments passed a law that cut the possibility of fraud occurrence the performance of the model improved rapidly. We estimate the impact of the VAT extortion on the carbon market at 1. 3 billion euros. Originality/value – This paper is the first study that attempts to prove and quantify scientifically the <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud on emission markets. 1...|$|E

40|$|EU VAT {{authorities}} {{are close to}} turning the tables on missing traders. For many years organized fraudsters have been stealing huge amounts of VAT on the domestic re-sale of exempt cross-border supplies. Losses have been enormous whether the transactions are in goods (notably cell phones and computer chips) or in tradable services (CO 2 permits and VoIP). No market has been safe from the fraudsters. Answers are developing, but these answers may look more like Armageddon than measured enforcement. Solutions are so draconian, and so all-encompassing that very few intra-community traders will feel safe from the gathering storm. The situation is not optimal, but {{it appears to be}} where we are headed. This paper discusses the alignment of (1) the joined cases of Axel Kittel v. Belgium and Belgium v. Recolta Recycling SPRL; (2) the Criminal Proceedings against R; and (3) the Council Directive 2010 / 24 /EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties, and other measures. A concluding section presents a series of six hypothetical fact patterns that apply these imperatives. In a nutshell, the argument presented through these hypotheticals is that Kittel is not for domestic-only application. Kittel responds just as effectively to multi-jurisdictional <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fact patterns as it does to domestic patterns. Secondly, it argues that “R” is an effective backstop to Kittel when tax authorities attack <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> fraud across Community borders. Third, it argues that MARC provides sweeping cross-jurisdictional investigative assistance to any Member State that is pursuing recovery from a fraudster, or group of fraudsters. And finally, it argues that because Member States are under an affirmative obligation to pursue missing traders throughout the Community to protect the common system of VAT from assault by criminals, these tools are being readied for use in a wide-ranging wave of MTIC enforcement efforts throughout the Community. MARC’s enhanced investigative and enforcement powers allow/compel an easy flow of information, notification and protective measures among the member States. Multiple recoveries are a very distinct possibility. The EU VAT does not have a mechanism that assures one recovery, and neither the ECJ nor the judiciary of the member States seem anxious to find one. This may all be the result of the severity of the <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> problem coming home to roost, but it is not good for legitimate business. Unfortunately we may witness a perfect storm. One cannot help but {{think that there is a}} better way forward...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} what <b>missing</b> <b>trader</b> intra-Community and carousel frauds {{are and how}} they are performed. A fault in taxing intra-Community supplies with value added tax (VAT) enables these frauds to take place. Member States and the European Commission are aware of the fault but are unable to agree on how to change the taxation of the mentioned supplies. Therefore, the fi ght against these frauds is conducted by improving tax inspection, tax cooperation between Member States, imposing liability on persons participating in the transactions in which these frauds occur, and disallowing the deduction of input VAT. The European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights have dealt with liability and deduction cases. They have decided that closing the tax gap by recovering VAT from persons participating in the transactions is legal if it is done in accordance with the so-called knowledge test...|$|E
