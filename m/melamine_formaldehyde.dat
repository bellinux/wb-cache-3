40|$|Melamine resins are {{polymers}} and {{consist of}} the starting substances (monomers) <b>melamine</b> and <b>formaldehyde.</b> The materials are hard and unbreakable, and for these material proper-ties {{they are used}} {{for the production of}} dishes and kitchen utensils. Consumer products made of melamine resins such as plates, cups, bowls or cutlery can re-lease <b>melamine</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> if they are exposed to high temperatures above 70 ° C. Migration limits have been set for the migration of <b>melamine</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> into foods. Testing by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) as well as test results of the com-petent Länder (regional) authorities for the official control of foodstuffs reveals that the regu-latory migration limits for the migration of <b>melamine</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> to food are exceeded at higher temperatures. This occurs especially at 100 °C, the boiling point of water. If kitchen utensils made of melamine resin are used for frying and cooking or the heating of foods in a microwave oven, amounts of <b>melamine</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> which present a health risk can transfer into food. This is especially the case for acidic foods including many fruit and vegetable preparations. Furthermore, the health risk through inhalation of formaldehyde from kitchen utensils is possible, as the substance also distributes into the air. BfR thus maintains that consumers should avoid the use dishes and kitchen utensils made of mela-mine resins when frying or cooking or when heating foods in a microwave oven. If the products are used at temperatures up to 70 °C, they {{are not likely to be}} dangerous to human health. Such temperatures are reached, for example, when hot beverages or foods are filled into cups, bowls or onto plates. Products made of melamine are also safe for use as salad servers or cutlery...|$|R

40|$|Crystalline {{melamine}} is a {{raw material}} for synthesizing of <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>melamine</b> resin. <b>Formaldehyde</b> <b>melamine</b> resin has been widely used in the industry. The simulation of fluidized reactor is a requirement of reactor design. To simulate the fluidized bed reactor is required that kinetic parameters (e. g. rate constant, k and reaction degree, n) and thermodynamic parameters (e. g. height, and minimum fluidization rate) to be known. The quantity of these parameters must be determine to synthesise melamine from urea (For both fixed bed reactor and fluidized bed reactor). They have been determined for both fixed bed and fluidized bed reactor in a pilot scale. Farshi (2002) has corrected these quantities for a two phases hydrodynamic model to simulate fluidized bed reactor. The results of these simulation and their comparison with the resulting experimental data from literature has been indicated that {{the results from the}} two phases model more properly matched with experimental data.

40|$|Background and Objective : Nanoclays as {{reinforcement}} filler for adhesives {{is being}} established but their efficacy against whiterot fungus in particle board {{is not much}} explored. The present aim {{of the study was}} to explore the usage of nanoclay Nanomer PGV against White rot fungus in particle board. Methodology : For the study, eight single layer particle board particle board made using (0. 25 and 0. 5 % wt) nanoclay reinforced Urea formaldehyde resin (UF) and <b>melamine</b> urea <b>formaldehyde</b> resin (MUF) was compared with control boards and boards made using 0. 5 % boric acid.

Efficacy of nanoclay against white rot fungus was studied using Agar block method as per IS: 4873. Results:The intensity peak of Nanoclay disappeared after being dispersed into the UF resin and MUF resin by mechanical mixing. This indicated that the UF resin or MUF resin was able to enter the interlayer space of Nanomer PGV, hence exfoliated. From the results of the efficacy test it was found that the nanoclay 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % concentration satisfied the attack of white rot in case of UF and MUF resin bonded particle board.

The boards were bonded with urea <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, <b>melamine</b> urea <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, or poly(methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) (PMDI). The sealed press improved the internal bond strength and thickness swelling of boards regardless of the binder used during the reduced pressing time.

Traditional lignosulfonate-based plasticisers, naphthalene and melamine sulfonate-based superplasticisers disperse the flocculated cement particles through a mechanism of electrostatic repulsion (see colloid). In normal plasticisers, the active substances are adsorbed on to the cement particles, giving them a negative charge, which leads to repulsion between particles. Lignin, naphthalene and melamine sulfonate superplasticisers are organic polymers. The long molecules wrap themselves around the cement particles, giving them a highly negative charge so that they repel each other.|$|E
