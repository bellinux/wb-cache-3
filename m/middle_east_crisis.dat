5000|$|Stagflation {{appears as}} a {{societal}} crisis, such as {{during the period of}} the oil crisis in the 70s and in 2007 to 2010. Inflation in stagflation, however, doesn't affect all firms equally. Dominant firms are able to increase their own prices at a faster rate than competitors. While in the aggregate no one appears to be profiting, differentially dominant firms improve their positions with higher relative profits and higher relative capitalisation. Stagflation is not due to any actual supply shock, but because of the societal crisis that hints at a supply crisis. It is mostly a 20th and 21st century phenomenon that has been mainly used by the [...] "weapondollar-petrodollar coalition" [...] creating or using <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>crises</b> for the benefit of pecuniary interests.|$|R
2500|$|The {{economy was}} soon in turmoil again, with the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>crisis</b> between Egypt and Israel raising oil prices.

A Common Market report suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued. Wilson and Callaghan refused a contingency fund offered from the IMF because of several conditions attached. On Wednesday 15 November, the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a 14.3% devaluation. The situation was a great political controversy at the time.

[...] Martin Luther King Jr. criticized this position at the 68th Annual Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative Judaism, [...] "On the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>crisis,</b> we have had various responses.

50|$|Most {{damaging}} to Franco-Arab relations, however, was the Suez Crisis. It greatly diminished France's {{reputation in the}} region.

50|$|The {{arrival of}} these new {{immigrants}} coincided with a growing curiosity about Islam among the American public in the late 1970s, following political events in the Muslim World, which had been up until this point, somewhat invisible from the American public's consciousness.

50|$|Originally, {{the program}} was aired live on the ABC network and {{featured}} a live studio audience.

Internal conflicts between Sawyer and Donaldson later led them to be separated, and the audience eliminated. However, the program has always had some live elements when broadcast as Primetime Live, generally consisting of Donaldson reading the opening remarks of packaged stories and the opening title as Primetime...

Eldrup has described how the first oil crisis showed to him the danger of placing all of ones eggs in one basket.|$|R
