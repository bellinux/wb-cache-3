40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to present a series of limit theorems that characterizes {{independent}} double random variables via four dimensional summability transformation. In order to accomplish this goal we began with the presentation of the following theorem that characterize pairwise independent random variables: let [xk,l] be a double sequence of pairwise independent random variables such that [xk, l] was uniformly integrable. Let [am, n, k, l] be a four dimensional matrix such that ≤ C for all ordered pair (m, n) and for some C and converges to 0 in probability Then (xk,l – E(xk,l) converges in mean to 0.

40|$|For the {{planning}} of minimal invasive brain surgery detailed knowledge of the individual anatomical structures is necessary. Therefore in medical practice high [...] resolution MR image data is recorded preoperatively. Due to tissue resection and cerebrospinal fluid leakage both shape and position of the brain change during the intervention (brain [...] shift). Therefore intraoperative data is used in addition, providing exact anatomical information. In order to accommodate the deformations of tissue for computer assisted surgery, nonlinear registration of the voxel data must be performed. In this context we propose a new voxel [...] based approach based on maximization of mutual information. For fast evaluation the nonlinear deformation is modeled by adaptively subdividing the data set into piecewise linear patches.

40|$|A new, non–parametric and binless {{estimator}} for {{the mutual}} information of a d–dimensional random vector is proposed. First of all, an equation that links the mutual {{information to the}} entropy of a suitable random vector with uniformly distributed components is deduced. When d = 2 this equation reduces to the well known connection between mutual information and entropy of the copula function associated to the original random variables. Hence, the problem of estimating the mutual information of the original random vector is reduced to the estimation of the entropy of a random vector obtained through a <b>multidimensional</b> <b>transformation.</b> The estimator we propose is a two–step method: first estimate the transformation and obtain the transformed sample, then estimate its entropy. The properties of the new estimator are discussed through simulation examples and its performances are compared {{to those of the}} best estimators in the literature. The precision of the estimator converges to values of the same order of magnitude of the best estimator tested. However, the new estimator is unbiased even for larger dimensions and smaller sample sizes, while the other tested estimators show a bias in these cases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid method for modeling and solving supply chain optimization problems with soft, hard, and logical constraints. Ability to implement soft and logical constraints {{is a very}} important functionality for supply chain optimization models. Such constraints are particularly useful for modeling problems resulting from commercial agreements, contracts, competition, technology, safety, and environmental conditions. Two programming and solving environments, mathematical programming (MP) and constraint logic programming (CLP), were combined in the hybrid method. This integration, hybridization, and the adequate <b>multidimensional</b> <b>transformation</b> of the problem (as a presolving method) helped to substantially reduce the search space of combinatorial models for supply chain optimization problems. The operation research MP and declarative CLP, where constraints are modeled in different ways and different solving procedures are implemented, were linked together to use the strengths of both. This approach is particularly important for the decision and combinatorial optimization models with the objective function and constraints, there are many decision variables, and these are summed (common in manufacturing, supply chain management, project management, and logistic problems). The ECLiPSe system with Eplex library was proposed to implement a hybrid method. Additionally, the proposed hybrid transformed model is compared with the MILP-Mixed Integer Linear Programming model on the same data instances. For illustrative models, its use allowed finding optimal solutions eight to one hundred times faster and reducing the size of the combinatorial problem to a significant extent...|$|E

40|$|Bogoliubov transformations {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied in several Condensed Matter contexts, e. g., {{in the theory of}} superconductors, superfluids, and antiferromagnets. These applications are based on bulk models where translation symmetry can be assumed, so that few degrees of freedom in Fourier space can be `diagonalized' separately, and in this way it is easy to find the approximate ground state and its excitations. As translation symmetry cannot be invoked when it comes about nanoscopic systems, the corresponding <b>multidimensional</b> Bogoliubov <b>transformations</b> are more complicated. For bosonic systems it is much simpler to proceed using phase-space variables, i. e., coordinates and momenta. Interactions can be accounted for by the self-consistent harmonic approximation, which is naturally developed using phase-space Weyl symbols. The spin-flop transition in a short antiferromagnetic chain is illustrated as an example. This approach, rarely used in the past, is expected to be generally useful to estimate quantum effects, e. g., on phase diagrams of ordered vs disordered phases.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} part of the article we {{introduce}} C ∗-algebras associated to self-similar groups and study their properties and relations to known algebras. The algebras are constructed as sub-algebras of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra (and its homomorphic images) associated with the self-similarity of the group. We study such properties as nuclearity, simplicity and Morita equivalence with algebras related to solenoids. The second part deals with the Schur complement transformations of elements of self-similar algebras. We study properties of such transformations and apply them to the spectral problem for Markov type elements in selfsimilar C ∗ −algebras. This is related to the spectral problem of the discrete Laplace operator on groups and graphs. Application of the Schur complement method in many situations reduces the spectral problem to study of invariant sets (very often of the type of a “strange attractor”) of a <b>multidimensional</b> rational <b>transformation.</b> A number of illustrating examples is provided. Finally we observe a relation between the Schur complement transformations and Bartholdi-Kaimanovich-Virag transformations of random walks on self-similar groups. 1...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{object of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a general multiple integral transformation whose kernel involves the H-function of several complex variables, which was defined and studied elsewhere by the present authors ([25], [26] and [27]). This integral transform, defined by Equation (1. 1) below, and its confluent form (1. 15), not only provide interesting unifications (and extensions) of the various classes of known integral transformations whose kernels are expressible in terms of the familiar E, G and H functions of one and two variables, or the product of several such functions, but also offer the possibility of their appropriate further generalizations involving multiple integrals. Since a great variety of functions that occur rather frequently in problems of applied mathematics and mathematical analysis are special cases of the kernel used here, and since the need for a simultaneous operational calculus (based upon <b>multidimensional</b> integral <b>transformations)</b> presents itself quite naturally when problems dependent on several variables are to be treated operationally, a systematic study of the integral transform (1. 1) and its confluent form (1. 15) is believed to yield deeper, general and useful results...|$|R
