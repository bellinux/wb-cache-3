2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in May 1892 reported, [...] "To-day, Mr. Kynnersley presided at the Third Court. Since {{the departure of}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> no official has been appointed to fill his place. The present arrangement is that Mr. Bland sits {{in the morning and}} Mr. Hare in the afternoon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Liberty Beef Steak Club {{sought to}} show {{solidarity}} with the radical John Wilkes MP and met at Appleby's Tavern in Parliament Street, London for an unknown duration after Wilkes's return from exile in France in 1768. [...] John Timbs wrote in 1872 of a [...] "Beef-Steak Club" [...] which met at the Bell Tavern, Church Row, Houndsditch, and was instituted by [...] "Mr Beard, Mr Dunstall, <b>Mr</b> <b>Woodward,</b> Stoppalear, Bencroft, Gifford etc". It is not clear if the Ivy Lane Club, of which Dr Johnson was a member, was a [...] "Beef-Steak Club", but it met at a famous beef-steak house.|$|E
2500|$|... 1925: On 21 August, the Ilkley Gazette {{received}} a letter of complaint that the collection was just a curiosity shop, and {{this led to the}} reduction of the collection in favour of its local heritage items. [...] However the letter did include a description of the exhibits of the time. [...] There was the Ellison collection of classified geological specimens. [...] There were photographs of the local great and good, a stuffed albatross and Japanese armour. There were valuable coins, a Queen Victoria mug, and the Anglo-Saxon cross shaft carvings, unlabelled. [...] The [...] "famous Roman triple vase [...] found near the Assembly Hall in Weston Road" [...] was still there with a serpent, boomerangs and a sawfish. The existence of superfluous paintings was bemoaned, with special attention being paid to the portraits of the Rombalds Moor hermit, and of James Fletcher (his name now changed to Metcalfe) the local 18th century blind fiddler - this latter was in the Museum's foundation collection, and possibly held some sentimental value for Ilkley residents. [...] It might also be worth noting that <b>Mr</b> <b>Woodward,</b> the classifier of the Roman artefacts, was absent in Greece when this article was written - so there may have been some political element involved in the publication of this piece. [...] The primary complaint is that items were intermixed and were not all labelled or classified, and the secondary complaint is that there was insufficient space to separate and classify them all properly. It appears well-intentioned, but there are possibly intimations of an administrative power-struggle in the background.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{knocked at the}} door, and Charley rose from his knees. 'Not quite yet, mamma,' said Katie, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> opened the door. 'Not quite yet; in five minutes, mamma, you may come.' <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> {{not knowing how to}} refuse, again went away.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> went {{her way to}} Norman's office, {{without having}} spoken to Alaric. 'You will come again soon, mamma,' said Gertrude. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> promised that she would.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> had no gin, but {{she could}} send out and get it; and the first evening of Captain Cuttwater's visit saw <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward's</b> own parlour-maid {{standing}} at the bar of the Green Dragon, while two gills of spirits were being measured out for her.|$|R
60|$|He rose to {{his feet}} and reached for his hat, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> intercepted him.|$|E
60|$|I was {{intensely}} {{surprised at}} this proposition, more so, I believe, than was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{asked the}} {{question}} sneeringly, but there was much of curiosity in his tones.|$|E
60|$|Things stood thus at Surbiton Cottage when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{received}} a proposition from {{a relative of}} her own, which surprised them all not a little. This was from a certain Captain Cuttwater, who was a maternal uncle to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> and consisted of nothing less than an offer to come and live with them for the remaining term of his natural life. Now <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward's</b> girls had seen very little of their grand-uncle, and what little they had seen had only taught them to laugh at him. When his name was mentioned in the family conclave, he was always made the subject of some little feminine joke; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> though she always took her uncle's part, did so {{in a manner that}} made them feel that he was fair game for their quizzing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps it's all fun,' said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward.</b> 'But come, girls, {{this is not}} fair; I won't let {{you look}} at the story till it's read in full committee.' And so saying, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> took the papers from her daughters, and tying them up, {{deposited}} them safe in custody. 'We'll have it out when the tea-things are gone.' ...|$|R
60|$|Arriving at <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward's</b> house, I {{ascended the}} steps and rang the bell.|$|R
60|$|Then I told of my {{interview}} with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> in his library and of Holtzmann.|$|E
60|$|Of course <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> and John Stumpy stoutly denied all I said, {{and their}} denial carried the day.|$|E
60|$|I did not finish. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> had strode over to {{the door}} and locked it, putting the key in his pocket.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{was past}} {{the power of}} speaking, and so Katie went on.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{pressed him}} to say whether his debts were heavy--whether he owed much.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> again sat down, {{and taking}} her daughter's {{hand in her}} own, caressed it.|$|R
60|$|I {{expected}} {{a storm of}} indignation from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> because of the last remark. Yet he {{showed no sign of}} resentment.|$|E
60|$|This was done, and we {{soon learned}} that beyond a doubt <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Chris Holtzmann had been among the {{departed}} passengers.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the last}} time, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> {{let me say}} I haven't got them, never had them, and, therefore, cannot {{possibly}} give them up." ...|$|E
60|$|Here Charley blushed, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{looked at}} him from {{over the top of}} the paper.|$|R
60|$|As {{they walked}} across the lawn <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> ran out to them. 'My dear, dear Charley,' she said, 'what am I to say to thank you?' It {{was the first time}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> had ever called him by his Christian name. It had {{hitherto}} made him in a certain degree unhappy that she never did so, and now the sound was very pleasant to him.|$|R
60|$|His {{lawyer was}} to call {{for him on the}} morning of the trial, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> was to be at the house soon after he had left it. He had not yet seen her since the inquiry had commenced, and it was very plain that he did not wish to do so. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> was to be there and to remain till his fate had been decided, and then--Not a word had yet been said as to the chance of his not returning; but <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> was aware that he would {{probably}} be unable to do so, and felt, that if such should be the case, she could not leave her daughter alone.|$|R
60|$|When {{therefore}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{declared the}} envelope to be empty every {{action of the}} tramp indicated {{that he did not}} believe the statement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{story is}} nonsensical, Strong," [...] broke in <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward.</b> [...] "Gentlemen like Mr. Stumpy here do not break into people's houses and commit robberies." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{surprised}} and indignant; surprised that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> should still insist upon my having taken his papers, and indignant because of his outrageous offer.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Linda {{looked at}} her, but Charley did not, and her blunder passed by unnoticed.|$|R
60|$|Finally it came {{half past}} eight, {{and putting on}} my hat, I started for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward's</b> residence.|$|R
60|$|Katie and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{exchanged}} furtive glances, {{but neither}} of them moved a muscle of her face.|$|R
60|$|At length {{they came}} out. Judge Penfold's {{face was a}} trifle sterner than before. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward</b> looked pleased, as if his {{argument}} had proven conclusive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, sir," [...] replied <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward,</b> vehemently. [...] "You've {{made some}} {{remarkable}} statements, young man, and I demand a clear explanation before you leave." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{concluded}} the man must be employed by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Woodward.</b> Perhaps I {{had seen him}} {{at some time in}} Darbyville, and so thought his face familiar.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{saw that}} if the story was to be read, the sooner they began it the better.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the house, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> went to her room, and Charley found himself alone with Katie.|$|R
60|$|Harry got up {{to follow}} her. Katie and Linda also {{instantly}} jumped from their seats to do the same. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> looked round, and motioned to them to stay with their uncle. Linda obediently, though reluctantly, remained; but Katie's impulse was too strong for her. She gave one imploring look at her mother, a look which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Woodward</b> well understood, and then taking silence for consent, crept into the dining-room.|$|R
