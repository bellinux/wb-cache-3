40|$|Abstract. A set {{of tasks}} {{has to be}} {{scheduled}} on the parallel identical pro-cessors of the clusters of a <b>multi-levels</b> distributed memory multiprocessor, subject to precedence constraints and small communication delays inside the lowest-level clusters. The architecture model includes networks of shared memory multiprocessors. In this paper, we present a new critical-path like algorithm that nds an optimal solution to this new problem in polynomial time, if task duplication is allowed {{and the number of}} available processors is not limited. The solution found is an earliest schedule that spreads the tasks between the <b>multi-levels</b> clusters and the processors. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problems of}} time and process facing network researchers. We argue {{that the problem of}} time in network research can be conceptualised as a problem relating to <b>multi-levelled</b> analyses. It is through a <b>multi-levelled</b> analysis that we find different temporal structures and thus different ways of temporal organising. First, we address both the problem of time and boundary in network analysis and propose introducing organisational routines as a way to appreciate how actors perceive temporal structures. We argue that the problem of time is more accurately described {{in the context of a}} process based approach to network research. Second, in the context of inter-organisational routines we consider how actors perceive time and how temporal structuring is negotiated through dialogues. A dialogical analysis, looking at real others, imaginal others and artifacts, can reveal different temporal structures in routines. Case data from a University-Industry inter-organisational context is discussed to illustrate these negotiated temporal structures. Third, we conclude that multiple levels of analysis in network research provide a more comprehensive picture of the network from a process perspective. This paper argues that while temporal structures or the problem of time is a secondary concern, <b>multi-levelled</b> analyses is more pressing for network researcher...|$|R

5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , <b>multi-level</b> cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E

Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning Star Drive, and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E

The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a <b>multi-level</b> transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E

The rotational properties of the spreading codes are further exploited to improve the modulation technique, throughput, spectral efficiency, and capacity. Additionally, the system is extended by making use of multiple carrier frequencies as in OFDM, with the additional benefits of being able to spread data in frequency and/or in time. The modem offers multiple access interference MAI-free and multipath interference MI-free operation in both asynchronous and synchronous communication, due to perfect autocorrelation and zero cross-correlation prop-erties of the spreading codes.

5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, <b>multi-level</b> dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the heads-up display (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.|$|E
