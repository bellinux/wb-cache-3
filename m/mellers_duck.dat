50|$|Due to {{the outward}} {{similarity}} of <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> {{to the female}} mallard, it was commonly placed close to that species. Based on records of quasi-forced hybridization under unnatural conditions, it was even proposed to be a mere color morph of the mallard.|$|R
50|$|Other {{endangered}} animals {{include the}} aye-aye, Alaotran gentle lemur, free-ranging black lion tamarin, pied tamarin and silvery marmoset, Andean bear, maned wolf, narrow-striped mongoose, Mauritius pink pigeon, Mauritius kestrel, Saint Lucia amazon, Bali starling, <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck,</b> Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), Round Island boa, Lesser Antillean iguana and Mallorcan midwife toad.|$|R
50|$|<b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> breeds {{apparently}} {{during most}} of the year except May-June on Madagascar, dependent on local conditions; the Mauritian population has been recorded to breed in October and November. Unlike most of their closer relatives—with the exception of the African black duck—they are fiercely territorial during the breeding season; furthermore, pairs remain mated until the young are independent.|$|R
50|$|Seventy-four {{species of}} birds are known from the reserve, of which forty-five are endemic. They are all listed as of least concern except <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas melleri), which is listed as {{endangered}} and the wedge-tailed jery (Neomixis flavoviridis), Madagascan yellowbrow (Crossleyia xanthophrys), Grey-crowned Tetraka (Bernieria cinereiceps), Pollen's Vanga (Xenopirostris polleni) and Rufous-headed ground roller (Atelornis crossleyi) which are all listed as near threatened.|$|R
5000|$|Previously thought extinct, (found {{when looking}} for {{something}} else), Durrell have recently teamed up with Madagascar to help research and study the species. With scouts unable to locate more individuals, {{it has become a}} possibility that experts will have to bring the survivors back to Jersey, using expertise from the Madagascar teal and <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> to help the duck get back from the brink ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas melleri) is {{a species}} of the dabbling duck genus Anas. It is endemic to eastern Madagascar. Although a {{population}} was established on Mauritius in the mid-18th century, this {{is on the verge}} of extinction due to habitat loss and competition by feral domestic ducks. The species name of this species is after the botanist Charles James Meller, and its generic name is from the Ancient Greek for a duck.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is also an}} {{important}} but increasingly threatened habitat for waterbirds, including the endangered <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas melleri). Two waterbird species were endemic to northern Madagascar, the Madagascar pochard (Aythya innotata) and the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus). The Madagascar pochard is now critically endangered and no longer found on the lake, although very small numbers exist elsewhere. The Alaotra grebe was declared extinct in 2010. In earlier times, Lake Alaotra was where the largest numbers lived, the near-flightless grebe may never have occurred elsewhere except in the immediate area of the lake.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck</b> {{resembles a}} large female mallard. At 55 - 65 cm, it averages {{slightly}} larger than a mallard and {{is at the top}} size for the Anas genus. However, as opposed to most mallard relatives, they lack a supercilium. The speculum feathers are green as in some of its relatives, but unlike in these, it is bordered white as in the mallard. Its body is dark brown with narrow paler fringes to feathers on upper parts and wider fringes on lower parts. Its bill is pale grey, with dark patches at the base, and is larger than normal. Its feet and legs are orange.|$|R
50|$|The Mascarene teal (Anas theodori), {{also known}} as Sauzier's teal and Mauritian duck, is an extinct dabbling duck that {{formerly}} occurred on the islands of Mauritius and Réunion. It was a small teal of the Anas gibberifrons superspecies of the Anas subgenus Nettion. Its closest relative is probably Bernier's teal from Madagascar and, apart from having stronger wings and being considerably bigger (between a Sunda teal and a mallard in size), {{it seems to have}} looked very similar to that species. Earlier, it was proposed that <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck,</b> also from Madagascar, is the closest living relative of A. theodori, but as more remains of the latter were unearthed this appears far less likely. Apart from a few, brief descriptions, not much is known about the bird in life, but its habits probably did not differ significantly from those of its close relatives. Bones have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius and more recently on Réunion also. The scientific name honours Thé́odore Sauzier, who made many bones of extinct birds found on Mauritius available to science.|$|R
500|$|Over time, a {{continuum}} of hybrids ranging between almost typical examples of either species develop; the speciation process is beginning to reverse itself. This has created conservation concerns for relatives of the mallard, such as the Hawaiian duck, the New Zealand grey duck (A.s. superciliosa) subspecies of the Pacific black duck, the American black duck, the mottled <b>duck,</b> <b>Meller's</b> <b>duck,</b> the yellow-billed duck, and the Mexican duck, {{in the latter case}} even leading to a dispute as to whether these birds should be considered a species (and thus entitled to more conservation research and funding) or included in the mallard species. Ecological changes and hunting have also led to a decline of local species; for example, the New Zealand grey duck population declined drastically due to overhunting in the mid-20th century. Hybrid offspring of Hawaiian ducks seem to be less well adapted to native habitat, and using them in re-introduction projects apparently reduces success. In summary, the problems of mallards [...] "hybridising away" [...] relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading; allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced today's diversity of mallard-like ducks despite the fact that, in most, if not all, of these populations, hybridisation must have occurred to some extent.|$|R

This tribe includes all of the 2 ̆ 2 puddle ducks 2 ̆ 2 that constitute most of the important game species throughout the world. Of the 39 species making up the tribe, all but 3 can readily {{be placed in the}} single genus Anas. The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|R
