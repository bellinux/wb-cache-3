5000|$|At MIT, Demain and {{his team}} “pioneered {{research}} on the elucidation and regulation of the biosynthetic pathways leading to penicillins and cephalosporins.” They did research into “peptide antibiotics and sporulation in B. subtilis; mycotoxins; new antibiotic discovery through <b>mutational</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> (making idiotrophs); cellulases and ethanologenic clostridia; vitamin B12; amino acids, organic acids and polymers; the immunosuppressant, rapamycin (sirolimus) and antitumour antibiotic, fumagillin; statins; pigments; vaccines (developing media with non-animal components for clostridial vaccines); and evaluating the impact of simulated microgravity on secondary metabolism 1.” Demain's MIT research led to “a breakthrough discovery of a key enzyme in cephalosporin biosynthesis -deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase ('expandase'). The discovery of this enzyme established the role of penicillin as an intermediate in cephalosporin C biosynthesis and disproved the previous hypothesis that these two separate end products of C. acremonium were formed by a branched secondary metabolic pathway.” ...|$|E

A natural triketide and its analogues, {{activated}} as N-acetyl-cysteamine thioesters, were synthesized and fed to a pikAI-deleted strain; {{this led to}} the production of new antibiotics. A vinyl analogue was found to have better antibacterial activity than pikromycin...|$|E
40|$|Aureothin {{is a rare}} nitroaryl-substituted {{metabolite}} {{from the}} soil bacterium Streptomyces thioluteus, which exhibits a variety of biological activities, including antifungal, antitumoral and insecticidal. By construction and screening of a S. thioluteus HKI- 227 genomic cosmid library, the aureothin (aur) gene cluster was cloned and sequenced. Detailed sequence analyses revealed that aureothin is synthesized by an unusual modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS), which has several exceptional features, including a novel priming mechanism and the iterative use of one module. Typically, modular type I PKS are arranged in an assembly line fashion, harboring a catalytic domain for each biosynthetic step. In stark contrast to this accepted principle of co-linearity, heterologous expression of the aur PKS cluster and fusion {{of the first two}} PKS genes demonstrate that one module catalyzes two successive cycles of chain extension, one of the first examples of a PKS in which such iteration or "stuttering" is required to produce the normal polyketide product. Further functional analysis of the aur biosynthesis gene cluster revealed several additional ORFs encoding starter unit biosynthesis enzymes, most remarkably an unprecedented N-oxygenase, which represents the first member of a new family of oxidizing enzymes. Furthermore, the order of the tailoring reactions was elucidated by <b>mutational</b> <b>biosynthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|At least 17 kb of DNA {{from the}} large unisolatable Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2) plasmid SCP 1 are {{concerned}} with methylenomycin <b>biosynthesis.</b> <b>Mutational</b> cloning analysis, using insert-directed integration of att site deleted phage vectors into an SCP 1 -containing host, provided evidence of two large transcription units, of at least 6. 6 kb and 9. 5 kb. At the leftmost apparent end of the larger (left-hand) transcription unit is a region apparently involved in negative regulation of methylenomycin biosynthesis: when fragments from this region were used to direct phage integration, marked overproduction of methylenomycin resulted. The methylenomycin resistance determinant {{is located at the}} rightmost end of this same transcription unit. Hybridisation analysis with 13 kb of the cloned mmy region showed that it was closely similar to a segment of pSV 1, a plasmid that specifies methylenomycin biosynthesis in S. violaceus-ruber SANK 95570...|$|R
