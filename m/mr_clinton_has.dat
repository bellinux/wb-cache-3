[...] "It seems <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> forgotten Russia is a great power that possesses a nuclear arsenal. We aren't afraid at all of Clinton's anti-Russian position. I want to tell President Clinton that he alone cannot dictate how the world should live, work and play. It is us who will dictate," [...] Yeltsin said. Yeltsin and President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin discussed both criticized U.S. global dominance. [...] "Jiang Zemin completely understands and fully supports Russia's actions in combatting terrorism and extremism in Chechnya," [...] Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said afterwards. Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China [...] "understands and supports the efforts made by Russia in safeguarding national unity and territorial integrity."' ...|$|E
50|$|As a land {{appraiser}} {{he admitted}} to conspiring with Jim McDougal and others with Madison Guaranty savings association. The case {{was part of the}} Whitewater property, which Bill Clinton and Jim McDougal originally purchased in 1978. The conspiracy was to inflate the estimates used for the loans. Kenneth Starr's investigators were also told that Palmer inflated estimates used to support loans made to Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. The false land appraisals made Madison Guaranty's books look better than they were. Mr. Palmer did about 90 percent of the appraisals for Madison and that about 90 percent of those were inflated. Madison records showed one appraisal was for a $1.05 million loan to Tucker and an associate to buy a water and sewer system for real estate development known as Castle Grande. Later appraisals found the system to be worth about 1/2 of the loan, when the loan went into default {{it was one of the}} largest losses for Madison. Hale has told investigators that a Palmer's appraisal and later loan for Etta's Place restaurant and two other lots for $825,000 from Madison that helped shore up his finances. Hale handled federally insured loans in Little Rock for the Small Business Administration. The loan helped him to issue an improper SBA loan to Mrs. McDougal. Hale said he made the $300,000 loan because of pressure from Gov. Clinton and Mr. McDougal. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> denied his claim.|$|E

60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly <b>have</b> liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent for the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert that <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Rumors {{circulated}} about Broaddrick's allegations {{for many}} years, {{but she refused}} {{to speak to the}} media.

60|$|Now, it chanced one {{day that}} the senior partner of the firm was summoned to serve on a jury at a coroner's inquest, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{furnished}} with the excuse that Mr Haynes was out of town, was told to go in his stead. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> never performed that part of a citizen's duties, for on becoming a householder he had hit upon the expedient of being summoned for his rates, so that his name should be struck off the coroner's list; he was very indifferent to the implied dishonour. It was with some curiosity, therefore, that he repaired to the court {{on the morning of}} the inquest.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> as before, <b>had</b> gone out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> did {{her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|R
5000|$|Defenders of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> {{said that}} Schmidt's {{coverage}} of her {{is not fair}} {{and he has been}} frequently criticized by the group Media Matters and other liberals. After breaking the Clinton email story, Media Matters's founder and chairman, David Brock, wrote an open letter to The New York Times about the story, [...] "prominent correction as soon as possible" [...] about the story. The Times did not run a correction. [...] The inspector general for the State Department said in May 2016 that Clinton's use of the account had violated State Department's record keeping policies.|$|R

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> became daily stronger, {{and soon}} he was quite well. He resumed {{his work at the}} office, and in every way seemed to have regained his old self. He gave {{utterance}} to no more startling theories, and the casual observer might have noticed no difference between him and the model clerk of six months back. But <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> received too great a shock to look upon her husband with casual eyes, and she noticed in his manner an alteration which disquieted her. He was much more silent than before; he would take his supper without speaking a word, without making the slightest sign to show that he had heard some remark of Mrs Clinton's. He did not read the paper in the evening as he had been used to do, but would go upstairs {{to the top of the}} house, and stand by an open window looking at the stars. He had an enigmatical way of smiling which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> could not understand. Then he had lost his old punctuality--he would come home at all sorts of hours, and, when his wife questioned him, would merely shrug his shoulders and smile strangely. Once he told her that he had been wandering about looking at men's lives.|$|R
60|$|Every morning <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{left his}} house in Camberwell {{in time to catch}} the eight-fifty-five train for the city. He made his way up Ludgate Hill, walking sideways, with a {{projection}} of the left part of his body, a habit he had acquired from constantly slipping past and between people who walked less rapidly than himself. Such persons always annoyed him; if they were not in a hurry he was, and they had no right to obstruct the way; and it was improper for a city man to loiter in the morning--the luncheon-hour was the time for loitering, no one was then in haste; but in the morning and at night {{on the way back to}} the station, one ought to walk at the same pace as everybody else. If <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> been head of a firm, he would never have had in his office a man who sauntered in the morning. If a man wanted to loiter, let him go to the West-end; there he could lounge about all day. But the city was meant for business, and there wasn't time for West-end airs in the city.|$|R
2500|$|Palin and Clinton were {{compared}} and contrasted {{with one another}} in the media. A New York Times article explains, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> is pantsuits; Ms. Palin is skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|R
5000|$|This led Feinman to {{complain}} {{at the time}} to Capitol Style magazine over the lack of acknowledgement. In 2001, The Wall Street Journal reported that [...] "New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton's refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book."Later, in a 2002 article for The Writer's Chronicle, Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style.

2500|$|On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks {{released}} emails {{and documents}} from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The New York Times reported that [...] "Assange accused <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> of <b>having</b> been among those pushing to indict him..."

2500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted {{with one another in}} the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election.

5000|$|After {{the success}} of The Real Anita Hill, Free Press paid Brock a $550,000 advance {{to write a book}} about Hillary Clinton. The {{expectation}} was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. The project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, proved to be largely sympathetic to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton.</b> <b>Having</b> received a $1 million advance and a tight one-year deadline from Simon & Schuster's then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In Blinded by the Right (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the Clintons, could not find any evidence of wrongdoing and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. National Review proposed another theory: since [...] "no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock", he could not collect the kind of information he was after. National Review also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been [...] "seduced" [...] by Sidney Blumenthal, a champion and friend of the Clinton circle.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, Schmidt {{broke the}} story that Hillary Rodham <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{exclusively}} used a personal email account when she was secretary of state.

5000|$|President <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{been showing}} {{that this is}} another way {{that he could be}} helpful to business. It wasn't a very high {{visibility}} bill.

And indeed, the proof is in the pudding.The last bill that came before President Clinton was that bankruptcy bill that was passed by the House and the Senate in 2000 and he vetoed it. And in her autobiography, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> took credit for that veto and she rightly should. She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy. She got it.|$|R
40|$|Reading the {{literary}} criticism {{which has been}} written almost 250 {{years after the first}} publication of Richardson’s Pamela 1 it is surprising to see how emotionally charged the Pamela-debate still is. Its central question, whether Pamela’s narration is reliable, is still able to initiate a heated discussion. The {{reason for this is that}} Pamela’s story is far more than the narration of the experience of a servant-girl. It always was and obviously still is a matter of politics and political correctness, almost comparable to the alleged sexual affairs of President Clinton. In Pamela’s case, however, we do not ask whether he really did it. Nobody wants to spare Mr B. the embarrassment of being guilty of sexual harassment. Mr B., clearly, is not the point of interest. Instead, we ask whether Pamela is really telling the truth about herself. This aspect of her reliability turns out to be the most important one. What is at stake is Pamela’s virtue, and this is the fate she shares with <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Both <b>have</b> been elected to hold a powerful public position, with the difference that Pamela has not been elected by the people but by her author Samuel Richardson.

50|$|On January 19, Clinton {{visited the}} Arlington Cemetery {{to visit the}} graves of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.

After kneeling at the graveside for a few moments, <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> each placed a white rose on the grave of Robert Kennedy, who was shot June 5, 1968, while campaigning for the presidency. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> then walked alone to John F.
