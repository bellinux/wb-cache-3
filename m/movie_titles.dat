25|$|On September 1, 2011, Starz {{announced}} that it would not renew its streaming agreement with Netflix, which ended on February 28, 2012; <b>movie</b> <b>titles</b> that are available on DVD from Sony Pictures, Disney and other studios that maintain pay television distribution deals with Starz were not affected and can be acquired from Netflix by this method. With the expiration of the Netflix deal, film content from studios with which Starz maintains broadcast rights were no longer available for online streaming, particularly as Netflix and certain similar services such as Vudu did not have separate streaming rights to films from these individual studios. Prior to the beta launch of its Starz Online service (which became StarzPlay upon its official launch), Starz announced on November 18, 2011 that it was developing a streaming application for mobile devices, allowing the network's subscribers – and in early reports, speculation that possibly non-subscription television subscribers would be allowed as well – to view Starz's series and film content. The app was released on October 9, 2012 for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, and on May 7, 2013 for Android devices. An app for the Xbox 360 was released on December 3, 2013, followed by an app for the Xbox One on August 5, 2014 (both are available for no extra charge to Xbox Live Gold members).|$|E
500|$|After {{its initial}} British release, {{including}} a one-year theatrical run in London, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned {{on the advice}} of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman.

In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for release with an 18 certificate (indicating that it should not be seen or purchased by a person under 18), and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.|$|E
