40|$|The Israel/Palestine {{conflict}} {{has a way}} of repeating itself; a way of crisscrossing {{in and out of the}} headlines of mainstream international media, often remaining as a spotlight to ongoing problems in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> more broadly. <b>Peace</b> <b>talks</b> have started and ended and begun again, but little progress is made when both sides claim stake to the land. There is a growing roar from civil society on both sides that changes must be made, while the changes may be different they stem from the hope for safety and freedom. These people are split both mentally and physically by a wall but there is hope yet. Violence between Israelis and Palestinians which seem to dominate the discussion is not the only story to be told, there is a story of hope, a story of the arts being used as a tool for education and for self-expression. This hope is being provided by arts programming that allows for Israeli and Palestinian youths to create works together, which allows them to have an outlet for their emotions and provides them with a non-violent path to resistance. By highlighting these stories and by creating a new performance based- alternative to this conflict with an original peace and implantation plan, perhaps a new door can be opened on a path towards coexistence and ultimately peace...|$|R

[...] Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and representatives of the Palestinians continued negotiating until the Oslo interim peace accords were concluded between Israel and the Palestinians in September 1993 and Jordan and Israel signed an agreement in October 1994.

5000|$|The Middle Eastern [...] "shuttle diplomacy" [...] as it {{was called}} was {{instrumental}} in brokering a permanent Middle Eastern peace. The role played by American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spends considerable time ole in the Middle Eastern Peace talks as he is a neutral party. He explains the reasons behind the need to pull out of Vietnam which only not complicated the Middle Eastern talks, but the infant nuclear nonproliferation treaty talks as well. Nixon used the Sino-Soviet split to start the path to ending the Cold War buy breaking down political and economic barriers between America and China which further isolated the Soviets. Kissinger talks about his role brokering the peace between the Arabs and Israelis, along with his role in ending the Nuclear arms race. Being the rare right man in the right place as secretary of state puts him in the unique role to bring the Arabs and Israelis together at the bargaining table to create a lasting peace in the Middle East. President Nixon also becomes a key player in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks,</b> as he ignores Eisenhower's advice to stay out and let the belligerents settle it themselves. He uses his position as President of the United States to become in his mind the greatest president of the 20th Century, possibly of all time, hitting many balls out of the ballpark, such as ending Vietnam, brokering the first nuclear arms treaty and opening up China to American trade will always be overshadowed by his involvement in Watergate, which is a shame as he has the most foreign experience of the prior two presidents.|$|E

40|$|The {{nine months}} of {{negotiations}} agreed last summer by the US mediators and the two parties ended on 29 April 2014.

Yet, a definitive breakdown {{or failure of the}} <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> bears far-reaching risks. Even if the mediators were to succeed in effecting a restart of talks, there is scant hope of bridging the rifts within the year envisaged â€“ at least if the previous approach were to be maintained. That will lead to a further consolidation of the one-state reality that has long since emerged between the Mediterranean and River Jordan. Germany and its partners in the European Union must face up to the alternatives: either a much more robust approach to propel the talks to a two-state solution, or insistence on equal political, economic and cultural rights for all in the territories controlled by Israel.

40|$|The {{process of}} the Middle East peace {{negotiations}} {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s has its roots in the changes in the international system and in Israeli society. The end of the Cold War, the Gulf War in 1990 - 1991 and globalization forced all the regionâ€™s actors to resituate themselves within the new international context. However, Israeli society neither experienced the international changes in the same way as its neighbors nor did it undergo the same evolutionduring the conflict with the Arabs. Because of this, the debate over peace and the future of the occupied territories became a factor for political and ideological division. Influencing this debate were revised conceptions on security, the economy, and the role Israel should play in the world. The <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> began because the strongest side in the conflict, Israelâ€™s Labor government, came to perceive that the maintenance of the status quo was negative forits interests. From the Israeli point of view, the conflict had long been considered a zero-sum game despite the Palestinianâ€™s compromises since the construction of the Palestinian State involved handing over part of the territory claimed by the Jews. Recent changes in the perceptions of Israeliâ€™s own interests, though, led some sectors of Jewish society to re-think and diminish the supposed incompatibility between Palestine nationalism and Zionism, which then opened the doors towards peace. For the Labor government, the territorial occupation of all Palestine was no longer a central objective. In fact, the basic interests of the Labor partyâ€™s policies shifted due to the globalization of the international system. For Likud and the Zionist revisionists, however, the occupation and the colonization of Eretz Israel still form the basic ideology of the State â€“of its reason for beingâ€“ for which even today both are associated with the national interest, together with Israelâ€™s very survival. Seen this way, Israelâ€™s internal divisions and the changes in the government of Tel Aviv have become the main threats for the future of peace in the zone, making this country the most unstable actor in the region...|$|E
