25|$|The main {{drawback}} of {{the transit}} timing method is that usually not {{much can be}} learned about the planet itself. Transit timing variation can help to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>mass</b> of a planet.

There are exceptions though, as planets in the Kepler-36 and Kepler-88 systems orbit close enough to accurately determine their masses.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} {{in a white}} dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy. As a result, it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse, but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure, causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of degeneracy yields a <b>maximum</b> <b>mass</b> for a non-rotating white dwarf, the Chandrasekhar limit—approximately 1.44 times of —beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A carbon-oxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit, typically by mass transfer from a companion star, may explode as a type Ia supernova via {{a process known as}} carbon detonation. (SN 1006 is thought to be a famous example.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of a limiting mass that no white dwarf can exceed (beyond which it becomes a neutron star) is another consequence of being supported by electron degeneracy pressure. These masses were first published in 1929 by Wilhelm Anderson and in 1930 by Edmund C. Stoner. The modern value of the limit {{was first published in}} 1931 by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his paper [...] "The <b>Maximum</b> <b>Mass</b> of Ideal White Dwarfs". For a non-rotating white dwarf, it is equal to approximately , where [...] is the average molecular weight per electron of the star., eq. (63) As the carbon-12 and oxygen-16 which predominantly compose a carbon-oxygen white dwarf both have atomic number equal to half their atomic weight, one should take [...] equal to 2 for such a star, leading to the commonly quoted value of 1.4 [...] (Near the beginning of the 20th century, there was reason to believe that stars were composed chiefly of heavy elements,, p.955 so, in his 1931 paper, Chandrasekhar set the average molecular weight per electron, , equal to 2.5, giving a limit of 0.91 [...]) Together with William Alfred Fowler, Chandrasekhar received the Nobel prize for this and other work in 1983. The limiting mass is now called the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple, self-consistent model {{to predict the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> of giant {{molecular}} clouds (GMCs), stellar clusters and high-redshift clumps {{as a function of}} the galactic environment. Recent works have proposed that these <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> are set by shearing motions and centrifugal forces, but we show that this idea is inconsistent with the low masses observed across an important range of local-Universe environments, such as low-surface density galaxies and galaxy outskirts. Instead, we propose that feedback from young stars can disrupt clouds before the global collapse of the shear-limited area is completed. We develop a shear-feedback hybrid model that depends on three observable quantities: the gas surface density, the epicylic frequency, and the Toomre parameter. The model is tested in four galactic environments: the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxy M 31, the spiral galaxy M 83, and the high-redshift galaxy zC 406690. We demonstrate that our model simultaneously reproduces the observed <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> of GMCs, clumps and clusters in each of these environments. We find that clouds and clusters in M 31 and in the Milky Way are feedback-limited beyond radii of 8. 4 and 4 kpc, respectively, whereas the masses in M 83 and zC 406690 are shear-limited at all radii. In zC 406690, the <b>maximum</b> cluster <b>masses</b> decrease further due to their inspiral by dynamical friction. These results illustrate that the <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> change from being shear-limited to being feedback-limited as galaxies become less gas-rich and evolve towards low shear. This explains why high-redshift clumps are more massive than GMCs in the Local Universe. Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures; accepted by MNRAS (March 27, 2017...|$|R

2500|$|Planets with orbits highly {{inclined}} {{to the line}} of sight from Earth produce smaller visible wobbles, and are thus more difficult to detect. One of the advantages of the radial velocity method is that eccentricity of the planet's orbit can be measured directly. One of the main disadvantages of the radial-velocity method is that it can only estimate a planet's minimum mass (...) [...] The posterior distribution of the inclination angle i depends on the true mass distribution of the planets. However, when there are multiple planets in the system that orbit relatively close to each other and have sufficient mass, orbital stability analysis allows one to constrain the <b>maximum</b> <b>mass</b> of these planets. The radial-velocity method can be used to confirm findings made by the transit method. When both methods are used in combination, then the planet's true mass can be estimated.|$|E
2500|$|The Chandrasekhar [...] limit (...) is the <b>maximum</b> <b>mass</b> of {{a stable}} white dwarf star. [...] The limit was first {{indicated}} in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E. C. Stoner in 1929. It was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon {{the accuracy of the}} calculation in 1930, at the age of 20, in India. [...] The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. [...] White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure (cf. main sequence stars, which resist collapse through thermal pressure). [...] The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. [...] Consequently, a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole. [...] Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. Collapse is not inevitable: most white dwarfs explode rather than undergo collapse.|$|E

40|$|Antikaon {{condensation}} and kaon and antikaon {{production in}} protoneutron stars are investigated in a chiral hadronic model (also {{referred to as}} the FST model in this paper). The effects of neutrino trapping on protoneutron stars are analyzed systematically. It is shown that neutrino trapping makes the critical density of K- condensation delay to higher density and (K) over bar (0) condensation not occur. The equation of state (EOS) of (proto) neutron star matter with neutrino trapping is stiffer than that without neutrino trapping, As a result, the <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> of (proto) neutron stars with neutrino trapping are larger than those without neutrino trapping. If hyperons are taken into account, antikaon does not form a condensate in (Proto) neutron stars. Meanwhile, the corresponding EOS becomes much softer, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>masses</b> of (proto) neutron stars are smaller than those without hyprons. Finally, our results illustrate that the Q values for K+ and K- production in (proto) neutron stars are not sensitive to neutrino trapping and inclusion of hyperons...|$|R
