5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, {{the change in}} {{direction}} was never recorded by magnetic declinations, fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral <b>magnetite.</b> While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the <b>magnetite</b> align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the <b>magnetite.</b> Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (<b>magnetite)</b> and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of <b>magnetite</b> gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for <b>magnetite,</b> money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume <b>magnetite</b> as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
40|$|<b>Magnetites</b> from skarn type {{deposits}} in Japan were cut, polished and etched, and etched surfaces were examined for textural types of etch figures. Various types of etched figures occur, and distinct patterns {{are associated with}} <b>magnetites</b> from distinct deposits. The figures are roughly classified into etch pits and zonings. The etch pits almost always appear on the polished surfaces of <b>magnetites</b> from several deposits. Etch pits are attributed to lattice defects or the presence of minor elements. The zoning patterns are observed in <b>magnetites</b> from several other deposits. The zoning patterns reflect multistage mineralization during skarn formation. For the Akaiwa deposit, zoning in <b>magnetites</b> are related to a shift from metasomatic to hydrothermal mineralization. These etch figures can be sensitive indicators of fluctuations of ore forming environments...|$|R

40|$|Double-doped {{magnetic}} {{particles that}} incorporated <b>magnetites</b> into both {{the surface and}} inside the silica cores were fabricated via the sol-gel reaction of citrate-stabilized <b>magnetites</b> with silicon alkoxide. Double-doped magnetic particles were easily fabricated and exhibited an higher magnetism {{in comparison to the}} single-doped magnetic particles that were prepared by the erosion of surface-deposited magneties from double-doped magentic particles. Thin gold layer was formed over magnetic silica nanospheres via nanoseed-mediated growth of gold clusters. The plasmon-derived absorption bands of double-doped magnetic silica-gold nanoshells were more broadened and shifted down by ca. 20 nm as compared to those of single-doped magnetic silica-gold nanoshells, which were attributed to not only the surface scattering of incident light due to relatively rough surafce morphology, but also heterogeneous permittivity of dielectric cores due to surface-deposited <b>magnetites...</b>|$|R
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, <b>magnetite,</b> in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E
5|$|Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has rocksalt structure. It {{is readily}} {{oxidized}} {{with water and}} oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600–700°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4), which has a spinel structure. Black cobalt(III) oxide (Co2O3) is also known. Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO (Néel temperature 291K) and Co3O4 (Néel temperature: 40K), which is analogous to <b>magnetite</b> (Fe3O4), {{with a mixture of}} +2 and +3 oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as <b>magnetite,</b> which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E
30|$|Halgedahl and Jarrard (1995) {{detected}} a dip and recovery below 120  K {{only in a}} mm-size crystal. There was no remanence dip in any of their glass–ceramic <b>magnetites,</b> spanning sizes of 0.2, 1.5, 7 and 100  µm. Glass–ceramic <b>magnetites</b> (Worm and Markert 1987) are well known to have high internal stresses because of their confinement in a glass matrix, and indeed we observe {{in the present study}} that internal stress in unannealed samples reduces the dip-and-recovery effect, particularly in the cooling curve (Fig.  4).|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of two natural <b>magnetites</b> were refined. Both {{turned out to}} have equipoints 8 a and 16 d (Fd 3 m) fully occupied and hence different from type I and type II defect structures investigated by Fleet (1981, 1982). It was possible to improve the cation radii for Fe 2 + ad Fe 3 + in octahedral and tetrahedral coordinations for pure and almost pure <b>magnetites</b> obtaining very good agreement between observed and calculated values of the two independent geometric structure parameters, i. e. cell edge and oxygen coordinate. The present results lead to an estimate of inversion parameter i in (Fe 1 –i 2 + Fe i 3 +) (Fe i 2 + Fe 2 t-i 3 +) O 4, of about 0. 90, equal for all the four pure <b>magnetites,</b> independently of type of structure and also of cooling history...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{interpretations of}} spinels in Archcan Fe-Ni sulfide ores from Western Australia must be revised {{in view of}} {{widespread}} metamorphic effects. When these effects are isolated, however, the spinels remain useful genetic indicators. Modified igneous chromites occur in the metamorphosed ultramafic host rocks but show no tendency toward gravity-induced basal accumulation. They may be distin-guished from chromites of metasomatic origin in contact reaction zones and from Cr-bearing <b>magnetites</b> produced during serpentinization. Ragged <b>magnetites</b> also attributed to serpentinization reactions occur in disseminated and matrix ores. In addition, the ores contain large subhedral ferrochromites and more euhedral <b>magnetites</b> which appear to be relict crystallization products of sulfide-oxide melts; their presence provides sup-porting evidence for an initially magmatic origin of the ores. Despite changes in their distribution during deformation, some gravitational concentration of the ferrochromites within ore is apparent; this concentration is incompatible with a single-stage magmatic model. Both the lithophile and chalcophile chromites in mineralized ultramafic rocks are unusually rich in zinc, a feature apparently inherited from the magmatic stage, and one which {{may be useful in}} exploration...|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore <b>magnetite.</b> By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), <b>magnetite</b> (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|Petrographically, the {{composition}} of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62.8% to 65.7%. Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, <b>magnetite</b> and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E
50|$|Miniaturised Mössbauer Spectrometer (MIMOS-II) {{provides}} the mineralogical composition of iron-bearing surface rocks, sediments and soils.

30|$|Although not remarked upon in any {{detail in}} most cases, similar {{magnetization}} dips and recoveries {{have been observed}} previously in cycling 300 -K remanences (Hartstra 1982, 1983; Halgedahl and Jarrard 1995; Özdemir and Dunlop 1999; Muxworthy and McClelland 2000; King and Williams 2000; Özdemir et al. 2002; Kosterov 2003). They are usually associated with the larger grain sizes. In Hartstra’s studies of sized crushed <b>magnetites,</b> dip and recovery was well developed in 150 – 250  µm, 100 – 150  µm and 25 – 30  µm grains, just detectable in 10 – 15  µm grains but absent from the data for <[*] 5  µm grains. Kosterov (2003, Fig.  2), using two of Hartstra’s HM 4 <b>magnetites,</b> found a similar result. These observations accord well with ours.|$|R

5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, <b>magnetite,</b> alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by <b>magnetite,</b> so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is <b>Magnetite,</b> which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} <b>magnetite,</b> an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E

Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained <b>magnetite</b> meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E

30|$|Ferritin-based ultrafine-grained <b>magnetites</b> can {{be taken}} as ideal sample for {{superparamagnetism}} study, because of (1) controllable and uniform grain size, (2) mono-dispersed, (3) lack of magnetic interaction, (4) good availability and (5) “ideal” SP behaviors at room temperature. Hysteresis loop confirmed that the ultrafine-grained <b>magnetites</b> in sample M 1 with a mean size of 5.3 [*]±[*] 1.2  nm are superparamagnetic at room temperature (Fig.  3), which corresponds to a Tb of 35  K (Fig.  5); at T[*]<[*]Tb, they can carry remanence (Fig.  6). Their frequency dependences of AC magnetic susceptibility are significant, e.g., peak temperature and value of AC susceptibilities decrease with frequency from 1  Hz to 1  kHz (Fig.  7). Cao et al. (2010) previously determined the value of pre-exponential factor f 0 in the Néel–Arrhenius equation from AC susceptibility data of M-HFn nanoparticles with a mean grain size of 3.9 [*]±[*] 1.2  nm: (9.2 [*]±[*] 7.9)[*]×[*] 1010 Hz and the extrapolated value of Mrs/Ms[*]=[*] 0.5 and Bcr/Bc[*]=[*] 1.12 at 0  K, which suggests the ferrimagnetic M-HFn is dominated by uniaxial anisotropy.|$|R
30|$|An {{interesting}} and unexplained detail of some cycling curves of room temperature remanence {{is a small}} to pronounced minimum at TV, particularly in warming curves (Figs.  3, 4, 5). Where the minimum is well developed there is an accompanying peak in both warming and cooling curves centered on 100 – 105  K. In cooling, this represents a spontaneous recovery of remanence lost in crossing the Verwey transition. This dip-and-recovery phenomenon has been widely observed but not convincingly explained. It is absent from samples with significant internal stress and from natural <b>magnetites</b> below about 15  µm in size. But artificial <b>magnetites</b> produced in a low-stress hydrothermal environment exhibit dips and peaks near TV in small grains and lack them in ≈[*] 100  µm grains (Muxworthy and McClelland 2000; Özdemir et al. 2002). The key {{may lie in the}} rather unexpected similarity between uniaxial monoclinic magnetization directions below TV and the corresponding cubic multiaxial patterns and Ms vectors above TV, as demonstrated by Kasama et al. (2013). What is recovered on a small scale over a few tens of degrees can evidently be retained as remanence memory over the broad temperature range of the entire cycling experiment.|$|R
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and <b>magnetite.</b> Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or <b>magnetite,</b> and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and <b>magnetite.</b> Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

Rock-magnetic experiments reveal that specimens from the Anno Formation contain vortex state (PSD) (titano) <b>magnetites</b> that can preserve reliable paleomagnetic signals. Paleomagnetic results illustrate that pAFD cannot remove the secondary magnetizations of polarity transition intervals and that pThD was suitable for reconstructing the magnetostratigraphy of the Anno Formation.|$|R
