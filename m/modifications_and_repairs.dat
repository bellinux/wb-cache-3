While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which <b>modifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
60|$|It has {{happened}} to me, on various occasions, to find myself in a certain edifice which would appear {{to have some of}} the characteristics of a public exchange. Its interior is a spacious hall, with a pavement of white marble. Overhead is a lofty dome, supported by long rows of pillars of fantastic architecture, the idea of which was probably taken from the Moorish ruins of the Alhambra, or perhaps from some enchanted edifice in the Arabian tales. The windows of this hall have a breadth and grandeur of design and an elaborateness of workmanship that have nowhere been equalled, except in the Gothic cathedrals of the Old World. Like their prototypes, too, they admit the light of heaven only through stained and pictured glass, thus filling the hall with many-colored radiance and painting its marble floor with beautiful or grotesque designs; so that its inmates breathe, as it were, a visionary atmosphere, and tread upon the fantasies of poetic minds. These peculiarities, combining a wilder mixture of styles than even an American architect usually recognizes as allowable,--Grecian, Gothic, Oriental, and nondescript,--cause the whole edifice to give the impression of a dream, which might be dissipated and shattered to fragments by merely stamping the foot upon the pavement. Yet, with such <b>modifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> as successive ages demand, the Hall of Fantasy is likely to endure longer than the most substantial structure that ever cumbered the earth.|$|E

50|$|Building the dam meant {{diverting}} {{the river}} from its normal path and pumping the riverbed dry. To accomplish this, workers dug a crescent-shaped canal 1000 ft long and 200 ft wide in the hill {{on the north side}} of the river, secured the canal with a masonry retaining wall, and built temporary dams to control the water flow. The initial construction lasted eight years, and extensive <b>modifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> went on for another six. Working conditions were often difficult. A silent film, The Croton Dam Strike, released in 1900, depicted labor - management problems related to the dam's construction.|$|E

The book remains the authoritative work on the marine chronometer.|$|E
