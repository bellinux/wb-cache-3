We miss him for his energy, his enthusiasm for {{teaching}} science, and his perception about how to improve science education. Frank Collea was not a big fan of using computers in instruction. Frank was neither an advocate of using computers to deliver instruction, nor an advocate of teaching their use as professional tools. Indeed, he thought that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> advocate computer use make assertions that are unwarranted. A decade ago, desktop computers were beginning to appear in colleges and universities in small numbers, and we began to explore their use (Sowell and Fuller, 1990). Since then, our thinking has changed substantially, moving away from having computers serve as patient teachers of the classical curriculum, and toward using them as professional tools—to extend, to magnify, to expand, and to enhance human reasoning. This article deals with the issues related to students learning to use computers as such professional tools. Two qualitative data sources inform this paper. The first is a recent doctoral dissertation consisting of a case study of a ‘mathematical methods in physics’ course that incorporated the use of Maple™* software (Runge, 1997). The other is an evaluation of a new undergraduate course, ‘multimedia physics,’ that sought to integrate mathematics and physics content, and involved the use of many media forms (Pytlik Z. and Spiegel, 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{people become}} social psychologistsbecause {{they want to}} change the world,and others enter the field because they are captivated by {{theoretical}} issues and basic research. The social activist depends on basic research, and the basic researcher often tries to extend theory and research into the real world. The trade-offs between basic and applied research are particularly salient in the area <b>of</b> education, because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are educators <b>who</b> are trying to change the world through our teaching. It makes sense that those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> doing research in the areas of social cognition, social influence, motivation, and group behavior (to name just a few top-ics with obvious educational implications) would see and appreciate the applications of our basic research to education. It also makes sense that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would want to under-stand the educational process more deeply. Sometimes we end up collecting data in educational settings out of convenience, because students in our classes can be a cap-tive population (at least when we can gain access to those populations). The most obvi-ous example is the reliance on students in introductory psychology classes who earn extra credit in their classes in exchange for participation in research. In other cases, researchers begin by studying basic phenom-ena in the laboratory but then extend their research to include studies conducted in classes and become more focused on educational issues over time.

60|$|Such {{it seems}} to me are the chief masses of the complex of motives in us, the group of sense, the group of pride, curiosity and the {{imitative}} and suggested motives, making up the system of impulses which is our will. Such has been the common outfit of motives in every age, and in every age its melee has been found insufficient in itself. It is a heterogeneous system, it does not form in any sense a completed or balanced system, its constituents are variable and compete amongst themselves. They are not so much arranged about one another as superposed and higgledy-piggledy. The senses and curiosity war with pride and one another, the motives suggested to us fall into conflict with this element or that of our intimate and habitual selves. We find all our instincts are snares to excess. Excesses of indulgence lead to excesses of abstinence, and even the sense of beauty may be clouded and betray. So to us all, even for the most balanced of us, come disappointments, regrets, gaps; and for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> are ill-balanced, miseries and despairs.

When two bells rang for their dinner, they were all hurrying to the cuddy table, and busy over their meal. What a sad repast their parents had that day! How their hearts followed the careless young ones home across the great ocean! Mothers' prayers go with them. Strong men, alone on their knees, with streaming eyes and broken accents, implore Heaven for those little ones, who were prattling at their sides but a few hours since.

60|$|I {{have never}} been able to rank myself among those who believe that the Budget will be {{rejected}} by the House of Lords.

It is not that I underrate at all the feelings of personal resentment and of class-prejudice with which they regard, naturally, many of the provisions of the Budget. But I have a difficulty in believing that the responsible statesmen by whom they are led, and by whom we think they are controlled, would not hesitate as patriotic men before they plunged the finances of the country into what would be a largely irremediable confusion. And still more I find it difficult to believe that Party leaders, anxious no doubt for office on the most secure terms and at the shortest notice, would voluntarily run unusual risks in order to be able to fight a decisive battle upon exceptionally unfavourable ground.

Let the discriminating reader, who {{at times}} may well spare {{a moment or two}} to the consideration and enjoyment of artistic excellence, be asked to reflect a little upon the texture of two stories included in this volume: [...] "A Piece of String," [...] and [...] "A Sale." [...] How many openings the last offers for the gratuitous display of the author's wit or clever buffoonery, the first for an unmeasured display of sentiment! And both sentiment and buffoonery could have been made very good too, in a way accessible to the meanest intelligence, at the cost of truth and honesty. Here it is where Maupassant's austerity comes in. He refrains from setting his cleverness against the eloquence of the facts. There is humour and pathos in these stories; but such is the greatness of his talent, the refinement of his artistic conscience, that all his high qualities appear inherent in the very things of which he speaks, {{as if they had been}} altogether independent of his presentation. Facts, and again facts are his unique concern. That is why he is not always properly understood. His facts are so perfectly rendered that, like the actualities of life itself, they demand from the reader the faculty of observation which is rare, the power of appreciation which is generally wanting in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> are guided mainly by empty phrases requiring no effort, demanding from us no qualities except a vague susceptibility to emotion. Nobody has ever gained the vast applause of a crowd by the simple and clear exposition of vital facts.

Now, Maupassant, of whom it has been said that he is the master of the mot juste, has never been a dealer in words.
