5|$|During the battle's final phase, Vukovar's {{remaining}} inhabitants, {{including several}} thousand Serbs, {{took refuge in}} cellars and communal bomb shelters, which housed up to 700 people each. A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker beneath the <b>municipal</b> <b>hospital.</b> The committee assumed control of the town's management and organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies. It kept the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and {{had at least one}} doctor and nurse assigned to it.|$|E

40|$|Over 60 % of the {{recurrent}} {{budget of}} the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Angola is spent on {{the operations of the}} fixed health care facilities (health centres plus hospitals). However, to date, no study has been attempted to investigate how efficiently those resources are used to produce health services. Therefore the objectives of this study were to assess the technical efficiency of public <b>municipal</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Angola; assess changes in productivity over time with a view to analyzing changes in efficiency and technology; and demonstrate how the results can be used in the pursuit of the public health objective of promoting efficiency in the use of health resources. The analysis was based on a 3 -year panel data from all the 28 public <b>municipal</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Angola. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a non-parametric linear programming approach, was employed to assess the technical and scale efficiency and productivity change over time using Malmquist index. The results show that on average, productivity of <b>municipal</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Angola increased by 4. 5 % over the period 2000 - 2002; that growth was due to improvements in efficiency rather than innovation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

The law established a Nurses Examining Board responsible for setting and enforcing standards of nursing education and practices. It also stipulated that the Board of Medical Examiners include two nurses.

25|$|Gouverneur Hospital {{opened in}} 1885, in a three-story {{building}} in Manhattan's Financial District.

This soon changed – about two years after opening, the hospital had 40 beds in use. An 1894 article in the New York Times stated that Gouverneur did not have the resources or the space to properly serve the growing community.|$|E
