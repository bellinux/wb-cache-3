5|$|When {{stretcher}} bearers {{reached the}} position at dawn, Derrick {{insisted that the}} other wounded be attended to first. Derrick was carried off Freda later that morning, where he was met by the 26th Brigade's commander, Brigadier David Whitehead. The two men briefly conversed before Derrick excused himself, fearing {{that he had not}} <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>left</b> and wishing to see the padre. Stepping back, Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson. At the hospital, surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick's liver; he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds. He was buried in the 2/48th Battalion's cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon, and later re-interred at the Labuan War Cemetery, plot 24, row A, grave 9.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Yardley {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Australian batsmen by employing leg theory, a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. As England had batted poorly in the first innings, allowing Australia {{to take the lead}} quickly, the home team sought to slow the tourists' momentum and force a drawn match. Despite the tactics, Australia reached 293/4 {{at the end of the}} day's play, captain Donald Bradman having registered his 28th Test century. Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England's stifling tactics, they remained patient as there was still <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>left</b> in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, the first in a series of dismissals in the leg trap, but his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett continued, making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. Laker was the leading bowler, taking 4/138. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller, who bowled a large amount of bouncers at Len Hutton and Denis Compton.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{repeatedly}} said in interviews {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more.

In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E

25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>left</b> in the match and wanted {{to have time to}} dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{moved to}} East York in 1947 {{after the death}} of her mother. Shortly after moving she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Feeling that she had not <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>left</b> Davidson immersed herself in community issues. It turned out that the cancer diagnosis was incorrect but she continued her involvement. She established a neighbourhood kindergarten which led to her being elected as a school trustee in 1948. In 1952 she became the first woman to chair the East York Board of Education. In 1958, she was elected to East York's town council. In 1960 she ran for the position of Reeve of the Township of East York against incumbent Jack Allen. The main issue at the time was uncontrolled development on land bordering the Don Valley beside Bayview Avenue. The development, later dubbed the Bayview Ghost, was a rallying cry for her campaign. She beat Allen by 5,065 votes to 3,458. Davidson was a dedicated politician, often attending community meetings, up to 40 per month. She was also a formidable debater, with an abrupt and abrasive style that annoyed her fellow council members. Yet the voters loved her and she was re-elected six times.|$|E

50|$|In general, the {{indication}} of the power reserve is sometimes represented through a needle or hand {{or it may be}} indicted by a revolving wheel viewed through an aperture. Some more modern devices have linear indicators. In the case of a hand indicator, the needle or hand moves from one point of the indicator to another. The zone along which the needle moves, shows how <b>much</b> <b>time</b> is <b>left</b> until the mechanism would be expected to cease autonomous operation. Correspondingly, when the hand leaves the zone (or stops) the watch needs to be wound. The indicator itself represents the amount of tension of the mainspring, thus the lower the tension the less <b>time</b> <b>left</b> until another winding of the watch is required.|$|R
40|$|We {{each have}} {{perceptions}} of how <b>much</b> <b>time</b> we have <b>left</b> {{and what we}} should do with it. These perceptions have implications for our treatment of forests. We can no longer take the longevity of trees and forest ecosystems for granted. Our power to change our environment is irresistible. The prevailing ethic of maximising material wealth is sweeping aside natural forests. They simply cannot compete in terms of generating revenue per unit area with land use alternatives such as intensive agriculture or forest plantations. Treating our life and living ecosystems as if they were infinite does not make them so. We need to reformulate an ethic that has a better understanding of time. We need that ethic embedded in policies and institutions that are temporally aware and serve future generations. The latter have no advocate to plead their case. This paper takes a preliminary look at some questions that deserve our attention: What is <b>time?</b> How <b>much</b> <b>time</b> is <b>left?</b> Should we adopt a precautionary approach as a result? What is it worthwhile for us to do with time – what constitutes value within it? Does value change over time? Can we share values without sharin...|$|R

50|$|All of {{the video}} games in the Super Mario Bros. series with the {{exception}} of Super Mario Bros. 2 have some sort of time limit. These limits usually start large and are used to keep players moving instead of waiting for enemies to fall down pits. Faster music appears when the time limit is about to be breached. Any amount of <b>time</b> <b>left</b> over is multiplied by a certain amount and added into the overall score. Time limits also appear in video games like Bébé's Kids and Timecop, both for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Other games that have time limits for various systems include: Mario Party (to determine when a minigame ends), Street Fighter V (to show how <b>much</b> <b>time</b> remains in a round), and Mario Kart 8 (to show how <b>much</b> <b>time</b> is <b>left</b> until a race or battle starts). A rare example of a time limit system that counts forwards instead of backwards is in Bio Senshi Dan: Increaser to no Tatakai. The more time players take to solve the level, the more powerful the end-level boss becomes.|$|R
