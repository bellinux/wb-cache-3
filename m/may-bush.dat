6000|$|Yea, when {{a glimpse}} of those {{imperial}} bowers [...] Would to a child be transport over-great, [...] When but a half-hour's roam through such a place [...] Would leave behind a dance of images, [...] That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks; [...] 115 [...] Even then the common haunts of the green earth, [...] And ordinary interests of man, [...] Which they embosom, all without regard [...] As both may seem, are fastening on the heart [...] Insensibly, each with the other's help. [...] 120 [...] For me, when my affections first were led [...] From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake [...] Love for the human creature's absolute self, [...] That noticeable kindliness of heart [...] Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most [...] 125 [...] Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks [...] And occupations which her beauty adorned, [...] And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first; [I] [...] Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds, [...] With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives [...] 130 [...] Left, even to us toiling in this late day, [...] A bright tradition of the golden age; [K] [...] Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses [...] Sequestered, handed down among themselves [...] Felicity, in Grecian song renowned; [L] [...] 135 [...] Nor such as--when an adverse fate had driven, [...] From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes [...] Entered, with Shakespeare's genius, the wild woods [...] Of Arden--amid sunshine or in shade, [...] Culled the best fruits of Time's uncounted hours, [...] 140 [...] Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede; [M] [...] Or there where Perdita and Florizel [...] Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King; [N] [...] Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is, [...] That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen) [...] 145 [...] Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far [...] Their <b>May-bush</b> [O], and along the streets in flocks [...] Parading with a song of taunting rhymes, [...] Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors; [...] Had also heard, from those who yet remembered, [...] 150 [...] Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked [...] Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; [O] and of youths, [...] Each with his maid, before the sun was up, [...] By annual custom, issuing forth in troops, [...] To drink the waters of some sainted well, [...] 155 [...] And hang it round with garlands. Love survives; [...] But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow: [...] The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped [...] These lighter graces; and the rural ways [...] And manners which my childhood looked upon [...] 160 [...] Were the unluxuriant produce of a life [...] Intent on little but substantial needs, [...] Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt. [...] But images of danger and distress, [...] Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms; [...] 165 [...] Of this I heard, and saw enough to make [...] Imagination restless; nor was free [...] Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales [...] Wanting,--the tragedies of former times, [...] Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks [...] 170 [...] Immutable and overflowing streams, [...] Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.|$|E
