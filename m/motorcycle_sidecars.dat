50|$|Jaguar's {{business}} was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making <b>motorcycle</b> <b>sidecars</b> before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under {{the ownership of}} S. S. Cars Limited the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Co, many bearing Jaguar as a model name. The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Lyons, having {{recognised}} {{the commercial}} potential for these sidecars, joined Walmsley {{and together they}} found premises in Bloomfield Road, Blackpool using a £1,000 bank overdraft obtained {{with the assistance of}} their respective fathers.

Walmsley's father bought a big building in Cocker Street Blackpool which they moved into and with all the extra space began to offer to repair and paint cars and fit new hoods and upholstery. They added coach building to their business name.|$|E

The halftracks would move up the hill as far they could and then the infantry they carried would dismount while covered by fire from 88mms. The Germans were maneuvering to hit American artillery anchored on the hill. They quickly overran front-line infantry and artillery positions.

5000|$|Many {{vehicles}} {{produced by}} Morrison-Electricar were classified by their payload, which {{was measured in}} hundredweights, and this usage has been retained in the article. A hundredweight is one twentieth of a long ton or 51kg, and is abbreviated to [...] "cwt". In the 1890s, Alfred Ernest Morrison started a small engineering company in Dover Stree, Leicester, using £22 of capital {{given to him by}} his father. Products included bicycles, motorcycles, and carriages to fit on the front of tricycles. He also patented and manufactured an independently sprung wheel which was fitted to <b>motorcycle</b> <b>sidecars.</b> Gradually, he diversified into gas-powered stationary engines, which were used to power water pumps, compressors and generators for lighting systems. By the early 20th century, the company was known as AE Morrison & Co, and they started to build Tiger motorcycles, but stationary engines provided the main focus. During World War I, the company repaired agricultural machinery, but reverted to making stationary engines when hostilities ceased. Expansion led to a move to Grace Road, Leicester in 1921-22, and the company began marketing chargers for vehicle batteries and also for radio batteries. When talking pictures were introduced to the cinema in the late 1920s, the business moved into the manufacture and installation of cinema equipment. One important innovation was an electric motor that ran at a constant speed. It was DC powered, with a nickel frame, rather than the more usual iron frame, and the constant speed ensured good sound reproduction.|$|E
