40|$|The {{concept of}} ambient {{intelligence}} requires software architectures enabling machine intelligence in unstructured dynamic environments. Research in mobile robotics tries {{to address this}} field since many years and has successfully created several architectural concepts for behavior-based reactive systems. We describe the architectural and communication-oriented capabilities of the modular controller architecture (MCA) and how ambient intelligence systems may benefit from these. Especially the shared memory approach of MCA offers a great possibility to facilitate distributed dynamic applications. MCA has been developed for mobile robotics research, initially at the FZI in Karlsruhe (K. U. Scholl et al., 2001) and is under continuous development. MCA addresses primitive and object-related communication, re-usability, component-based development, hardware access and application distribution. We {{want to take a}} closer look on the MCA framework and how it is already in use within an assisted living environment, established during several projects at Fraunhofer IESE (J. Nehmer et al., 2006) (M. Becker et al., 2007). Several sensors and a <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> were provided by the Robotics Research Lab and the MCA framework was used for service interconnection. An intelligent refrigerator, two human localisation technologies and the mobile service robot ARTOS have MCA running as described in section 3. We present our experiences with the modular controller architecture regarding the parameters identified by the ubiquitous community (M. Weiser, 1991). The outline of this paper is as follows: first the architectural approaches in other projects are mentioned. The modular controller architecture is described in detail, with focus on the requirements of ambient intelligence. We continue by describing our assisted living demonstrator and the services and applications relevant to this work. With reference to our example implementation we conclude the features of MCA that comply to the requirements. Furthermore it is described which future work shall lead to addons and concepts to overcome certain weaknesses in the current system architecture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} districting problems for emergency service systems (such as ambulance systems). In such a service system, typically, N <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>units</b> cooperate {{in responding to}} calls from the public. The assignment of <b>service</b> <b>units</b> is determined by a priority order (such as the order of proximity) for the available <b>service</b> <b>units.</b> We divide the entire service area into several districts by considering the priority order. We give a general formulation for the districting problem and propose a model to obtain the objective for the formulation. The objective function of the formulation is the average response time computed from a stochastic model. The model assumes the continuous-time Markov chain with characteristic of random arrival of calls, assignment of a <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> considering the priority orders, service times depending {{on a combination of}} available <b>service</b> <b>units</b> and districts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consenting individuals were invited and attended five medical outreach activities in rural and urban areas of the Calabar region between January and June 2016. Abdomino-pelvic scans were done. Subsequently the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-four (574) individuals had Abdomino-pelvic scans done, using a curvilinear probe to assess the abdomino-pelvic organs. The female to male ratio was 1. 46 : 1. The age ranged from 1 - 78 years {{with a mean of}} 40. 63 (standard deviation of 17. 5). The commonest sonographic finding was uterine fibroids, 21 (8. 1 %). Fifty-four percent of the scans were normal. The commonest sonographic finding in men was prostatic enlargement. CONCLUSION: Medical outreach activities provided by mobile units provide much needed ultrasound services in poor resource settings in Nigeria.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The success of the large-scale event industry, which deals with managing events such as Olympiads and occasional mass tourism, depends mainly on two factors: {{the quality of the}} program, {{and the quality of the}} facilities and services provided. The mega-event of the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, currently attracts more than two million visitors from all over the world for about two weeks; generating a huge demand for services, for short periods, at four nearby pilgrimage cities. Therefore, in order to enhance the feasibility, availability, and the quality of services for the Hajj of the future, a system of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> (MSUs) is proposed, instead of fixed service centres, to serve the expected 4. 8 million pilgrims by year 2025. A Multi-disciplinary engineering approach has been used to investigate the proposed system of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> in macroscopic and microscopic scales on the light of the new master plan for the cities of the Hajj. A survey (questionnaire) was conducted to investigate the opinions of service providers (297 respondents) to be considered. Various designs and configurations were developed to investigate the ability to construct the proposed system. Modelling and simulation of the system were used to develop and to investigate the operation and the control for the system and its effect on the mass transportation of pilgrims during the Hajj. It is found that whilst the service providers consider the current services relatively sufficient, they are enthusiastic regarding implementing the proposed <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> for the Hajj of the future. They contributed actively in determining 44 types of services that they considered as feasible to be mobile and highlighted their concerns, which are resolved by the findings of this research and the master plan for the cities of the Hajj. The possibility of making the proposed system of MSUs has been confirmed from many perspectives. The web search has revealed that many <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are available commercially and special MSUs could be built using existing technology. More MSUs designs and configurations are proposed and various urban design layouts have demonstrated their integration with the master plan of the cities of the Hajj. Moreover, an abundant and low-cost resource for making MSUs is identified by recycling out-of-service buses used for the Hajj, and modular extension units are proposed to simplify converting these buses to spacious MSUs. Simulation results have identified the proper service capacities for the proposed MSUs. An approach for Just-In-Time MSUs (JIT-MSUs) is shown, by simulation, as feasible to control the proposed system of MSUs, through an online control of the orders to move MSUs to provide the right services, at the right place, at the right time; achieving higher efficiency and utilization of resources. A Fuzzy Logic method is used, on a microscopic scale to issue requests for MSUs according to local situations; and on a macroscopic scale to evaluate all requests according to global conditions relating to the system as a whole. Simulation results confirm that MSUs will not affect the mass transportation of pilgrims as they make use of the unused capacity of the Shuttle Buses road networks. Simulation results also show that a significant reduction in resources, and a high increase in profit, compared with fixed services can be achieved using the proposed MSUs. It is concluded that, the proposed system of MSUs is technically, operationally and economically viable and expected to contribute to the success of the mega-event of the Hajj throughout providing an adequate amount of a wide variety of quality facilities and services, at all locations, whenever needed, without increasing the cost of services. Further studies for establishing the proposed system of MSUs for the Hall and integrating it with the Shuttle Buses transportation system, according to the master plan of the cities of the Hajj, are suggested...|$|R

During 1992 - 93, a total of Rs 828. 9 million was allocated to PWP, of which 85 percent was reported to be utilised, which amounts to Rs 702. 87 million. Service delivery of family planning is a major focus and component of the PWP. The major service delivery sources include Family Welfare Centres (FWCs) in both the government and NGO sectors, <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> (MSUs), Reproductive Health Services (RHS), Village-based Family Planning Workers (VBFPW), Hakeems, and Private Medical Practitioners, etc. All sources of delivery of family planning during the three decades of programme efforts have achieved the maximum extent of effective coverage, estimated to be between 15 - 20 percent in early 1990 s but no more than 5 percent to rural population [Rukanuddin and Hardee Cleveland (1992) ]. Besides limited coverage, the low level of accessibility and limited contraceptive availability, particularly to rural populace, have also seriously affected the performance of the PWP. These concerns have been addressed in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, which aims at increasing the urban coverage from 54 percent to 100 percent and the rural coverage from 5 percent to 70 percent. The major mode of service delivery to increase the rural coverage is the Village-based Family Planning Worker (VBFPW) scheme that would offer FP services to approximately 12000 villages. This scheme, however, focuses on non-clinical and temporary methods only. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century, {{there were more}} than 40 {{earthquakes}} greater than 7 magnitude occurred worldwide, 10 of which in China, which killed 600 thousand people accounting for 53 % of global earthquake deaths. On May 12, 2008, an 8. 0 -magnitude earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, causing 69000 deaths, 18000 missings, and 370000 injuries. Among 10 thousand severe injuries, most were traumatic injuries, 74 % of which were fracture. On April 14, 2010, a 7. 1 -magnitude earthquake occurred in Yushu, Qinghai Province. There were 2698 deaths, 270 missings and 11000 injuries. Among 3100 severe injuries, fracture accounted for 58. 4 %. After each earthquake, the Chinese Army Medical Services took actions and made quick response according to the law. They sent out elites with efficient command and scientific organization, fully participating in the medical rescue operations. After Wenchuan earthquake, 397 <b>mobile</b> medical <b>service</b> <b>units</b> and 7061 health workers were sent out. A total of 69000 people were treated, and 22000 cases of surgeries were performed. After Yushu earthquake, a total of 25 <b>mobile</b> medical <b>service</b> <b>units</b> and 2025 health workers were sent. They performed 1635 cases of surgeries with a miracle of "zero death" in mass earthquake casualties and altitude diseases in cold highlands. After each earthquake, injuries cured within 1 week accounted for 60 % of the total, and patients evacuated accounted for 80 % of the total, which owed to the effective first aid in site of Chinese Army Medical Service. They effectively played the role as the main force, making significant contributions for the final victory of earthquake relief. From the practice of medical rescue revelation after the two earthquakes, what Chinese Army Medical Services Services learned are: firstly, the theory of medical relief should be innovated; secondly, military and civilian organizations should be coordinated; thirdly, professional rescue force should be strengthened; fourthly, supporting means should be constructed; fifthly, international communication and cooperation should be deepened. </p...|$|R

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] is common to control systems or plants through changing the values of their inputs in continuous or small discrete steps to achieve gradual change {{of the performance of}} the plant under control. However, when changing the inputs can only be achieved in large discrete values, problems arise on achieving stability of the plant under control as such large discrete changes in inputs cause large overshoots and oscillation at the outputs. More difficulties arise when multiple plants are competing simultaneously for limited resources of such large discrete values. This paper describes an approach for controlling such plants. The case study presented is to control a proposed system of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>units</b> (MSUs) to be used in a mega-event, the Hajj, where different locations/zones will be competing simultaneously for a limited number of MSUs in order to provide adequate services for their continuously changing number of visitors. These MSUs are of high discrete values such that their provision or removal generates a significant change in the performance of the system. Fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs), representing each zone, are developed for issuing requests for MSUs based on their local situations. These requests are evaluated by the control centre using other sets of FLCs to consider global situations. An algorithm is used to respond to these evaluated requests according to their relative importance and issues orders to MSUs to move to the right zone at the right time to provide the appropriate amount of service for the existing number of visitors or what can be called 'just-in-time MSUs' (JIT-MSUs). Simulation results show that such a system can be controlled using the approach suggested by this paper and the response of the system varies with the values of its discrete inputs. Some conclusions and recommendations are drawn for the appropriate discrete input values and their control settings. The procedure for evaluating the different simulation runs for the different control settings is also presented...|$|R

The ongoing mobile revolution has dramatically and fundamentally changed our daily lifestyles, {{and it will}} continue to do so in a foreseeable future. For the next generation, <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> end users have more demands for such services. This thesis examines the challenging user perspectives in designing and developing high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The aim of this research is to develop reference models and elicit user requirements for 3 G and beyond <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in order to improve the quality of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis first examines the existing architectures and models for high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> followed by the contributions of the thesis. In this thesis, a Cyberworld model, which is a contribution to the WWRF reference modeling initiative and a specification of the WSI reference model, was developed and it serves as a basis for 3 G and beyond <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> design and development. A series of definitions of the Cyberworld model and a roadmap of the enabling technologies were also built up. The emphasis of this part is on how to describe and model user participation in <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> For this purpose, a model of the communication element to represent the components of the wireless world was created. Both static and dynamic reference modeling steps were established to better describe and understand user participation in <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The validation was achieved through the CyPhone navigation <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> In order to enhance <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> mobility, personalisation, and security, an ontology based model was developed to extend the Cyberworld model functionalities. The innovative ontology based mobile system will greatly increase service mobility, personalisation and security, thus improving the quality of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The ontology based model was illustrated and validated using a healthcare <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> A Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was adopted in this research in order to elicit, weigh and prioritise actual user requirements and link them to technical design requirements of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Traditionally QFD is employed in manufacturing industry. This approach is now extended to the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> industry for the first time.

40|$|The {{working paper}} starts with an {{overview}} of the growth in research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Based on the increase in the research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> the last few years, the fact that the last general review article on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> we identified was published in 2010, and the change to more appbased <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> we argue for the importance of conducting a review to identify gaps in the literature that should be guiding future research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The methodology applied to identify articles for the review is described along with {{an overview of}} the journals from which the articles are selected. The main categorization of the articles includes conceptual, qualitative, and quantitative contributions. The analysis starts with a description of the <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> studied within each of the main categories of the articles. The analysis shows that articles sometimes operate with rather generic descriptions of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> category studied – e. g. mobile commerce, mobile marketing, <b>mobile</b> data <b>services,</b> etc. The next part of the analysis is a review of the main topics studied in the articles. The conceptual articles typically focus 1) definitions, opportunities and challenges of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> 2) description of success criteria, 3) implications of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> and 4) description and discussion of system design and modelling processes. The main focus of the qualitative studies is on success criteria. Also, a few articles look into issues of business models and system design and modelling processes. The quantitative studies constitute the largest category of articles. A lot of these studies look into success criteria – and a large part of this topic is covered by adoption studies focusing antecedents of successful adoption of various <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> It is an interesting observation that surveys seem to be the dominating methodological design in the quantitative studies. Based on the review, the main gaps identified are 1) only a few studies look into app-based <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> This seems reasonable as app-based <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are a rather novel type of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> but it is still worrying due to the apparent success of these services. 2) Only a few studies look into effects of using <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> and when compared to the large amount of adoption studies, this is emphasized as an interesting path for future research. 3) Only a few studies seem to focus on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> developed for specific contexts. A few exceptions are, for example, two studies investigating in-store <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> – <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> tailored to support the shopping experience in a specific store. We see this as an interesting direction for future research as we also expect a growth in such types of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in the years to come. 4) We also observe that a rather small part of the studies are applying experiments as the methodological design. To improve the validity of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> research, we argue for the importance of applying more experiment based research designs...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> {{market has}} gone through a major change in the last several years. The market has evolved from a {{traditional}} monopolistic situation to a situation with a variety of different service providers. The competition in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market has grown at an exceptional rate in the past several years, and customers can now freely migrate form one service provider to another. With fewer new subscribers to sign up for <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> managing customer churn {{has become one of the}} most critical challenges for the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers. The focus has now switched from acquiring new customers to rather retaining existing ones. The aim of this paper is to study the competition between <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers, and examine different types of churning behavior in order to predict the future of the market. In particular, the study looks at what happens in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market when we have churning. Customer churning behavior plays an important role in the market, and in order to predict the future of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market, it is critical to understand what drives customers to churn. This study, investigates different churning determinates that affects the churning behavior. The research also includes network effects and word-of-mouth effect. The study proposes a model, called the Competitive <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> Model (CMSM), to model the competition between service providers in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market. The model is taking into account the adoption of new customers and churning between <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers. The CMSM model was implemented in AnyLogic with system dynamics, and tested with three different scenarios to analyze the temporal evolution of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market. The main findings in this study show that churning in the market matters, and the churning rate significantly affects the temporal evolution of adopters in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>services</b> {{differ from}} {{traditional}} services {{in their ability}} to provide service offerings regardless of temporal and spatial constraints. They are also different from traditional interpersonal services that are delivered face-to-face, or from other types of e-services, such as wireless online services, where the service delivery is linked to a specific fixed local area network or specific location. Although an increasing number of academic studies are starting to focus on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> from a service management perspective, rather than a technology perspective, formal classifications or categorizations of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are still scarce. The aim of the paper is to develop a conceptual classification for <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> that depicts the special nature of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> and gives indications how to categorize services from a customer centric perspective. The classification is based on the type of consumption, the context, the social setting, and the relationship and it represents aspects that influence the overall value of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> These issues are described more in detail by breaking them down into classification grids that differentiate <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> from one another by describing the aspects in a twodimensional way. We provide examples of existing <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in each classification grid...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{highlight}} the connections between the diffusion of innovation theory and the evolutionary models for technological changes {{within the context of}} mobile communication research. On the basis of empirical findings, the discussion focuses on addressing three research questions: Why should <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion be understood as an evolutionary process? How should <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion be explained and modelled using evolutionary conceptions? And in what way the evolutionary framework could influence future <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion studies? Based on empirical observations and a literature study, this thesis argues that <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion involves dynamic, developmental and historical economic process which is comparable to an evolutionary process. Some essential features of evolutionary processes can also be observed empirically along the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion. For instance, the presence of various generations of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> technology along the diffusion timeline as well as different intensities of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> use, i. e. single subscriptions and multiple subscriptions, indicates that the variation characterizes the diffusion process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> The cord-cutter population implicitly indicates the presence of selection mechanism of individuals who choose to retain mobile-only communications rather than other type of communication. Similarly the existence of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> non-users also implicitly indicates that retention exists along the diffusion process. All these indications suggest that the evolutionary concepts are relevant in order to comprehend <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion. To explain and model <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion using an evolutionary framework, this thesis underlines the importance of data granularity and the use of a relevant diffusion model. The use of data granularity is critical to represent the variation and to serve as a proxy for making trend projection based on the level of interest. The use of a relevant diffusion model is essential to describe the pattern of the data according to selection mechanisms that determine the diffusion process. The evolutionary variation and selection mechanisms are also considered in two examples of diffusion modelling that address the level of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> use and intergenerational technology effects. The results show intuitive trend projections as well as realistic understanding toward the process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion which are helpful for business strategy and policy planning. However the proposed approach is still unable to address different actors and forces that may internally or externally influence the evolutionary process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion (i. e. dynamics in pricing, inter-technological substitutions and complementarities, service bundling, etc.). This suggests that future studies in <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion should take into account the evolutionary conceptions that could model dynamic interactions of relevant actors and interests in <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R
