40|$|The {{realistic}} {{investigation of}} the real behavior {{of the most important}} <b>machine</b> <b>elements</b> (gears, flexible drives, clutches, rolling and hydrodynamic bearings, etc) needs the application of several disciplines during the analysis process (contact mechanics, elasticity, fluid flow, heat exchange, noise propagation, for mechatronic elements the consideration of the effects of magnetic field or electricity could be also important). This fact gives the multidisciplinarity of the analysis process for <b>machine</b> <b>elements.</b> This multidisciplinary analysis process is used for checking several criteria or for the evaluation of the objective function(s) during the optimization of these elements. This way the optimization procedure of the most important <b>machine</b> <b>elements</b> develops into a multidisciplinary optimization process, which needs faster and more efficient tools of optimization and analysis, comparing to a conventional optimization process. In a previous paper (which could be treated as the first part of a series of papers concerning multidisciplinary optimization of <b>machine</b> <b>elements),</b> was shown the necessity and general basis of the multidisciplinary optimization of <b>machine</b> <b>elements,</b> giving many possible disciplines which could be integrated into a multidisciplinary optimization process.

The results of this more general optimization procedure could be useful for practical gear designers in the improvement and development of gears. 2.

The simplest form of bearing, the plain bearing, consists of a shaft rotating in a hole. Lubrication is often used to reduce friction. In the ball bearing and roller bearing, to prevent sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance. The term [...] "bearing" [...] is derived from the verb [...] ""; a bearing being a <b>machine</b> <b>element</b> that allows one part to bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness and location of the surface.

The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.|$|E
