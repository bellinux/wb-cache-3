Microgrids utilizing an Energy Management System (EMS) may be the answer to control and route power more efficiently. The power quality achieved from a single phase pulse-width modulation (PWM) voltage source inverter (VSI) (the heart of an EMS) driving an inductive and capacitive (LC) filter with linear and non-linear loads was investigated in this thesis. The open loop PWM waveforms are compared to the power quality standards for ship board power, MIL-STD- 1399 - 300 B. This quantifies the performance limits of open loop PWM, which is the simplest control strategy for a single-phase VSI. Closed loop control is shown to be necessary when larger loads are connected to the VSI in order to prevent output voltage sag. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

These results are in accordance with a number of studies in the relevant literature. In particular, Zhu et al.

Indeed, the tourism sector contributes to the exports efforts of these countries through the foreign currency given by tourists, while it contributes to imports of merchandise, because these tourists use goods and services among which some are imported. This result is opposite to that by Katircioglu (2009 b) who shows the presence of unidirectional causality running from trade to tourism for the case of Cyprus.

40|$|Abstract. Wireless sensor {{networks}} and Radio Frequency Identifiers are becoming mainstream applications of ubiquitous computing. They are slowly being integrated into our infrastructure and therefore must incorporate {{a certain level}} of security. However, both applications are severely resource constrained. Energy scavenger powered sensor nodes and current RFID tags provide only 20 µW to 50 µW of power to the digital component of their circuits. This makes complex cryptography a luxury. In this paper we present a novel ultra-low power SHA- 1 design and an <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> ultra-low power AES design. Both consume less than 30 µW of power and can therefore be used to provide the basic security services of encryption and authentication. Furthermore, we analyze their energy consumption based on the TinySec protocol and come to the somewhat surprising result, that SHA- 1 based authentication and encryption is <b>more</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> than <b>using</b> AES for payload sizes of 17 bytes or larger. ...|$|R
