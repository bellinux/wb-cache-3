The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> composes and arranges music is at his home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to four hours a week.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E

After getting both the approval of Nowitzki and his parents, Geschwindner put his student through an unorthodox training scheme: he emphasized shooting and passing exercises, and shunned weight training and tactical drills, because he felt it was [...] "unnecessary friction". Furthermore, Geschwindner encouraged Nowitzki to play a musical instrument and read literature to make him a more complete personality.|$|E

In that, more than in anything else, Bush stood apart. He had an uncanny ability to judge the speed of a runner on his way to first.

2500|$|L'Enfant Plaza was {{considered}} a masterpiece {{when it opened in}} 1968. Washington Post architectural critic Wolf von Eckardt called it [...] "a triumph of good architecture over bad planning." [...] He believed it would be D.C.'s version of Rockefeller Center or the Place Ville-Marie, and predicted people would throng the plaza—which he felt would be the [...] "city's major urban attraction." [...] Von Eckardt piled praise on the plaza itself, calling it [...] "exceptionally attractive" [...] and [...] "modern America's most beautiful 'outdoor salon'". He also lauded the [...] "marvelous" [...] cruciform-and-globe light fixtures and the huge [...] "dramatic" [...] fountain. Architects Chloethiel Woodard Smith and Louis Justement felt the esplanade and plaza were an [...] "essential...appropriate entrance to the Southwest." [...] Five years later, in 1973, von Eckardt continued to sing the plaza's praises despite its shortcomings. Although he recognized that the plaza was largely devoid of foot traffic <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> considered it a [...] "superb work of urban design" [...] on par with the great plazas and squares built in Paris under Napoleon III or Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being [...] "paired as a set", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, {{as well as all}} introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a [...] "basic framework" [...] to write the story within. In addition to figuring out how to explain the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it [...] "a little extra punch". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three helped each other come up with ideas and figure out the best ways to make the story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters [...] "take on {{a life of their own}} and make their own decisions" [...] when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> would let the story go where the characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop.|$|E
