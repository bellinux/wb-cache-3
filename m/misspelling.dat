5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a <b>misspelling</b> of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and noted a <b>misspelling</b> in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Hugh Hancock, {{the founder}} of Strange Company, {{launched}} a new website, machinima.com. The new name surprised the community; a misspelled contraction of machine cinema (machinema), the term machinima was intended to dissociate in-game filming from a specific engine. The <b>misspelling</b> stuck because it also referenced anime. The new site featured tutorials, interviews, articles, and the exclusive release of Tritin Films' Quad God. The first film made with Quake III Arena, Quad God {{was also the first}} to be distributed as recorded video frames, not game-specific instructions. This change was initially controversial among machinima producers who preferred the smaller size of demo files. However, demo files required a copy of the game to view. The more accessible traditional video format broadened Quad Gods viewership, and the work was distributed on CDs bundled with magazines. Thus, id's decision to protect Quake IIIs code inadvertently caused machinima creators to use more general solutions and thus widen their audience. Within a few years, machinima films were almost exclusively distributed in common video file formats.|$|E

5000|$|In English, {{a common}} haplographical mistake is the {{rendering}} of consecutive letters between morphemes {{as a single}} letter. Many commonly <b>misspelled</b> words have this form. For example, <b>misspell</b> is often <b>misspelled</b> as mispell. The etymology of the word <b>misspell</b> is the affix [...] "mis-" [...] plus the root [...] "spell", their bound morpheme has two consecutive s's, {{one of which is}} often erroneously omitted. The opposite of haplography is dittography.|$|R

25|$|A third {{species of}} Sebecus, S. querejazus, was named in 1991 {{from the early}} Paleocene Santa Lucia Formation in Bolivia. This {{extended}} the range of Sebecus {{back to the beginning}} of the Paleogene, soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. In 1993, Gasparini et al. described Sebecus carajazus. This was not a fourth species but a <b>misspelling,</b> or lapsus calami, of Sebecus querejazus.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{abundance}} of biblical manuscripts exist a number of textual variants. The vast majority of these textual variants are the inconsequential <b>misspelling</b> of words, word order variations and the mistranscription of abbreviations. Text critics such as Bart D. Ehrman have proposed {{that some of these}} textual variants and interpolations were theologically motivated. Ehrman's conclusions and textual variant choices have been challenged by reviewers, including Daniel B. Wallace, Craig Blomberg and Thomas Howe.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the generic and {{specific}} names differ by a single letter has also led to the <b>misspelling</b> of the species as Atropus atropus in some publications. The species is most commonly referred to in English as the cleftbelly trevally, with other names including cleftbelly kingfish, Kuweh trevally and thin crevalle. It is also occasionally called the 'blackfin jack', but {{should not be confused}} with Hemicaranx zelotes, also known by that name.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosperity}} {{engendered by}} the wooden shipbuilding industry allowed The Bend to incorporate {{as the town}} of Moncton in 1855. The first mayor of Moncton was the shipbuilder Joseph Salter. The town was named after Lt. Col. Robert Monckton, the British military commander who had captured Fort Beauséjour a century earlier. A clerical error {{at the time the}} town was incorporated resulted in the <b>misspelling</b> of the community's name which has been perpetuated to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The Transylvania Law Society asked Menefee's colleague, Thomas F. Marshall, {{to deliver}} a speech on Menefee's life and {{character}} at Marshall's convenience.

Kentucky historian Lewis Collins opined that, had he lived, Menefee would have succeeded Henry Clay {{as the leader of the}} Whig Party. Menifee County, Kentucky is named in Menefee's honor, despite the unintentional <b>misspelling</b> of the name.|$|E

Her stupidity manifests in many ways, from forgetting ideas on the spot to mispronouncing or <b>misspelling</b> simple words. Like her mother, she is quick to steal Al's money for expensive things. Her favorite hobby is belittling her lonely and sexless brother, though she stands up for him against anyone outside the family.|$|E

25|$|Later medieval traditions locate Starkad's {{death and}} the heath of Roljung to Skåne. According to the Annales Ryenses (late 13th century), it was still {{possible}} to see Starkad's sword in the water beneath the bridge of Boilyngh when the water was low. It is likely that Boilyngh is a <b>misspelling</b> of Roljung. Later this spot was located to Rönne river, and in the 16th century, people talked of the Stones of Starkkarl at Vegeholm. The Danish folklorist Axel Olrik and Arthur Stille recorded many recent traditions about Starkad in north-western Skåne.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery's {{east side}} is the {{fastest-growing}} part of the city. Development of the Dalraida neighborhood, along Atlanta Highway, began in 1909, when developers Cook and Laurie bought land from the Ware plantation. A Scotsman, Georgie Laurie named the area for Dál Riata, a 6th-7th century Gaelic overkingdom; a subsequent <b>misspelling</b> in an advertisement led to the current spelling. The first lots were sold in 1914. The city's two largest shopping malls (Eastdale Mall and The Shoppes at Eastchase), {{as well as many}} big-box stores and residential developments, are on the east side.|$|E
25|$|The first {{business}} model that dissuades illegal file sharing {{is to make}} downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, <b>misspelling</b> an artist's name in a search query will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long and frustrating process. Furthermore, some illegal file sharing websites are host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see torrent poisoning).If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are reasonably priced, consumers will purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.|$|E
