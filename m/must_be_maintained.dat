5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the subway}} system {{operates}} on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours {{some of the}} designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often {{referred to as the}} 'shuttle train' version of its full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.|$|E

5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
25|$|The carbon {{tetrachloride}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> anhydrous throughout the reaction, as {{the presence of}} water may likely hydrolyze the desired product. Barium carbonate is often added to maintain anhydrous and acid-free conditions.|$|E

25|$|WAAS is {{not capable}} of the {{accuracies}} required for Category II or III ILS approaches. Thus, WAAS is not a sole-solution and either existing ILS equipment <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> or it must be replaced by new systems, such as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).|$|E

25|$|In {{extremely}} humid locations, adding insulation to {{an already}} well-insulated tank may cause condensation leading to rust, mold, or other operational problems so some air flow <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained,</b> usually by convection caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{creation}} of functional tissues and biological structures in vitro requires extensive culturing to promote survival, growth and inducement of functionality.

25|$|Temperature management. The same {{temperature}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> {{throughout the}} cell {{in order to}} prevent destruction of the cell through thermal loading. This is particularly challenging as the 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O reaction is highly exothermic, so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell.|$|E
25|$|Litter traps {{can be used}} {{to capture}} litter as it exits {{stormwater}} drains into waterways. However, litter traps are only effective for large or floating items of litter and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> A recent watershed litter survey showed a difference in the composition of street litter and stormwater litter.|$|E
25|$|Modern reflectors are {{commonly}} made of compression-moulded or injection moulded plastic, though glass and metal optic reflectors also exist. The reflective surface is vapour deposited aluminum, {{with a clear}} overcoating to prevent the extremely thin aluminium from oxidizing.

The pH <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> below 10 using a buffer for {{the reaction to}} proceed. The active oxidizing agent of nitroxide is hypobromite anion; hence, potassium bromide is used as an additive. No epimerization of α-stereogenic centers in carbonyl-containing products takes place.|$|E
