5|$|Between 1963 and 1975 {{significant}} {{portions of}} US6/SR14 {{were moved to}} a freeway alignment. The former routing south of Mojave (and the current routing to the north) is still known as Sierra Highway. The first freeway section, from just east of Solemint Junction to Red Rover <b>Mine</b> <b>Road,</b> was completed in 1963. Further portions in the intercanyon areas of Acton to Soledad Pass were completed by 1965. By 1966 the freeway was complete {{as far north as}} Avenue P-8 in Palmdale. The freeway was completed to Mojave by 1972.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines that dot the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke <b>Mine</b> <b>Road,</b> Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} northern terminus of M-26 was in Laurium at M-15 (now US41); it {{was extended}} by 1927 along US41 to Mohawk and then replacing M-83 to Gay. This extension would be reversed in 1933 when the Mohawk to Gay routing {{was turned over}} to Keweenaw County control. A second extension in 1935 along US41 to Phoenix replaced M-129 between Phoenix and Eagle Harbor. At this time, M-206 was designated from M-26 to the Eagle Harbor light house. A rerouting of M-26 in November 1940 moved it between Phoenix and Eagle River, replacing M-111. The segment between Phoenix and Eagle River along Copper Falls <b>Mine</b> <b>Road</b> {{was turned over to}} Keweenaw County at this time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 renumbering, Route 8 was renumbered to Route 94, {{which was}} {{extended}} northeast past Newton along former Route 31 to the New York state line, matching NY 94 across the border. It was initially only marked south of Hamburg, as {{none of the}} route north of Hamburg was state-maintained. Originally, Route 94 began at the now razed Delaware Bridge, where US 46 would cross into Pennsylvania. Route 94 would wind right and north-east a few to Columbia, where it joined its current route. In December 1953, both the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge and Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge opened. That year a section of Old <b>Mine</b> <b>Road</b> was rebuilt and aligned as a four lane freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. Following this, US 46 was rerouted over the first several miles of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and Columbia, and Route 94 was cut back to Columbia, near the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Here, US 46 would end and US 611, would cross the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge from Pennsylvania and follow the freeway north to the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The freeway portion that US 611 followed {{became a part of}} I-80 in 1959. When US 611 was removed from New Jersey by 1969, Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Also by this time, the unsigned portions of Route 94 north of Newton were signed. In 1973, this whole area was realigned into a complex interchange as the New Jersey portion of Interstate 80 was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Abbott family once {{constructed}} a sawmill on Stafford Meadow Brook near Scranton. It eventually {{came to be}} owned by the Slocum family. The Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company historically had substantial operations in the watershed of the stream. The company was {{closely linked to the}} stream's watershed during its development in the 1840s. In the 1880s, they constructed several iron ore quarries along the stream. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook included agriculture and coal mining. The stream became a major water supply by the early 1900s, when it was used as such by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. It continues {{to be used as a}} water supply in the 21st century. Historic sites in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook include the Pennsylvania Gravity Railroad and Ore <b>Mine</b> <b>Road.</b> The stream also passes by St. Mary's Cemetery. Several old rail corridors remain in the watershed: the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad, the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, the remains of the Pennsylvania Coal Company Gravity Railroad, and the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company gravity railroad. As of 2001, there are plans to revive the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad as a freight and tourist line.|$|E
25|$|The fell is ascended {{either from}} Braithwaite or Stair in the Newlands Valley; the ascent from Stair uses an old <b>mine</b> <b>road</b> up Stoneycroft Gill which crosses the {{shoulder}} of the fell at a height of 460m (1,510ft) from where the walker then strikes northerly to attain the summit. The direct route from Braithwaite follows Barrow Gill south westerly before going west to the highest point. The fell is often climbed along with the adjoining fell of Barrow to which it is connected by a ridge.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps most walkers {{will arrive}} at Sail {{as part of}} a ridge-top traverse, {{starting}} either with Grasmoor or Causey Pike. Direct routes from the north east begin at either Braithwaite or Stair. From the former the track to High Coledale Farm is the initial objective, before crossing the Outerside ridge in the vicinity of Stile End. The path then rises to Sail Pass from the north. Starting from Stair, the Stoneycroft <b>Mine</b> <b>Road</b> also gives access to Sail Pass, via the cobalt mine. From Buttermere village a long walk up Sail Beck and 'behind' Ard Crags can be used to gain Sail Pass from the other side.|$|E
25|$|A {{narrow road}} runs east {{from the village}} of Ennerdale Bridge, giving access to a pair of car parks near the outflow of the lake. Two {{principal}} alternatives are available from here to climb Crag Fell. The first is to loosely follow the course of Ben Gill up beside the plantation, before swinging left toward the summit. A more interesting route is to use the lakeshore path to reach the top of Anglers Crag, before working up the hillside to turn Revelin Crag to the west. This takes the walker past what Wainwright called the Crag Fell Pinnacles, a fractured spine of rock rising 80ft above the angle of the slope. Other ascents can be made from the Coldfell Road, south of Ennerdale Bridge. A track, formerly the <b>mine</b> <b>road,</b> can be followed almost to the summit, passing over the flanks of Grike. A circuit of the upper Calder, taking in the whole Lank Rigg group can also be started from here.|$|E
25|$|High Spy {{is often}} climbed {{as part of}} the Newlands Horseshoe ridge walk but can be ascended {{directly}} despite being defended by crags on both its Newlands and Borrowdale sides. From Borrowdale a path goes from Rosthwaite and climbs through the disused Rigg Head Quarries to reach the col linking High Spy to Dale Head and then up the south ridge to the summit passing a small unnamed tarn just before the top. From this side it is also possible to start from Grange and use an old drove road to get through the barrier of Blea Crag and then approach the summit. A scrambling route also starts from Grange, going via Hollows Farm it tackles the rocky rake of Nitting Haws directly. From Little Town in the Newlands valley an old <b>mine</b> <b>road</b> zig zags up to the col between the fell and Dale Head to then reach the top by the south ridge.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} day of the battles, 12 August, under great {{pressure}} to act by the Minister of Interior and the Prime Minister, the army decided to intervene in the battle. The army involved itself by sending military helicopters followed by two efficient flights by Macedonian Air Force Sukhoi Su-25s. The air bombardment, and the consequent approach of the army infantry and armed vehicles, {{put an end to the}} advances by the NLA, and brought a turnaround on the battlefield. NLA insurgents withdrew to their trenches and earth bunkers at their initial positions around the village of Raduša, or escaped to Kosovo. After breaking the encirclement, the army extracted the thirty-five policemen, with their equipment, and repositioned them in a more strategic position at the abandoned buildings on the Raduša <b>mine</b> <b>road</b> towards Skopje. One hundred and seventy policemen were added to reinforce this new position. The army also reinforced the already established positions for the defence of the Rašče water springs.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, he {{convinced}} his brothers Charles and Maurice {{to come along}} with him and see for themselves. Starting in 1812, they began buying and mining large tracts of inexpensive land. They were able to extract several tons of anthracite at a time, but lost most of what they tried to bring back to Philadelphia due to the treacherous waterways that were the main method of transportation in the interior. While the southern reaches of the Coal Region were already beginning to supply Philadelphia, they realized that the areas they had been exploring and mining were well-positioned to deliver coal to New York City, which had experienced an energy crunch after the War of 1812, when restrictions {{were placed on the}} import of British coal. Inspired by the new and successful Erie Canal, they envisioned a canal of their own from Pennsylvania to New York, through the narrow valley between the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains, to the Hudson River near Kingston, a route followed by the Old <b>Mine</b> <b>Road,</b> America's first long-distance transportation route.|$|E
25|$|During the French and Indian War (as the Seven Years' War's {{hostilities}} in North America were called), Sussex County {{was often}} raided by bands of Native Americans, among them {{members of the}} Lenape, Shawnee, and Iroquois who fought against white settlers. In 1756, {{a small band of}} Lenape raided the homes of local militia commanders, killing several members of the Swartout family and kidnapping other settlers during the Hunt-Swartout Raid. In response to these aggressions, Royal Governor Jonathan Belcher approved a plan for 8 forts to be constructed along the Delaware River to defend the New Jersey frontier from such incursions, and authorized the New Jersey Frontier Guard to man them. Several of these forts were little more than blockhouses, others were personal homes that were fortified. These forts went from Phillipsburg northward to Belvidere in Warren County. Then north of Blairstown to Van Campen's Inn. Then north along {{the eastern side of the}} Delaware River to Port Jervis, New York. The first fort was called Fort Reading. This fort was near the Pequest River on the south side of the river near the Belvidere-Riverton Bridge. This fort was built in 1757. The second fort was Ellison's Fort built of stone in Knowlton Township. This fort is located at the Delaware River Family Campground. The trail went through the Kittatinny Mountains north of Blairstown to Colonel Isaac Van Campen's Inn 1742, about 18 miles northeast of Fort Reading. This fort is located in Walpack Township. Fort John also called Headquarters Fort was up a hill near Van Campens Fort. The next fortification was Fort Walpack build six miles north of Van Campens Fort in the bow of Walpack Bend around 1756. This is in Walpack Township. About six miles north of Walpack Fort is Fort Nominack 1756, which is located just north of Jager Road and Old <b>Mine</b> <b>Road</b> in Sandyston Township. The next fort was Fort Shipeconk 1757 located 4 miles north of the previous fort. A fortified house owned by Captain Abraham Shimer was very close to Fort Shipeconk. Further north the next fortified house was maintained west of Port Jervis, New York and it was called Fort Cole. After Fort Cole there was Fort Gardner which was located north of Port Jervis below the Great Mountain. After the war ended in 1763, there was very few Native Americans left in Warren county.|$|E
