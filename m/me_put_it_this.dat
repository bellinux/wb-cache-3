40|$|Abstract: It is {{sometimes}} said that Everett’s formulation of Quantum Mechanics dispenses {{us with the}} need of a theory of consciousness in the foundation of physics. This is false as Everett himself clearly recognized in his paper. Indeed he has build its quantum mechanics formulation by us-ing explicitly the mechanist or computationalist hypothesis in psychology. Everett and his followers have then derived the subjective appearance, {{in the mind of}} machine-observers, of indeterminacy and non-locality from the Schrödinger Equation. I argue in this paper that if we take the compu-tationalist hypothesis seriously enough then the Schrödinger equation itself should be derivable from the computationalist theory of consciousness, mak-ing ultimately physics a branch of machine’s psychology. I sketch the basic argument and illustrate it with two embryonic derivations. In some sense I criticize Everett for his lack of radicality. 1 Quantum Realism Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> way: all sufficiently realist 1 interpretations of quantu...|$|R

Article 51 gives the right of self Article seems to have a diametrical ap consensus with regard to the concept of aggression. What the Article intent to prohibit is the aggressive war. Though war is a peremptory right of the state and is closely associated with the right to existence it is not absolutely an unconditional right. It is a last resort for existence; perhaps the right to wage war has undergone a dramatic change with the development and advancement of civilization among the nations and that’s why a exceptional right under exceptional circumstance and as an eternal right for existence, so it’s clear that war do existence as a legal affirmation under UN Charter but with restric self-defense can be exercised to protect states eternal right to existence. So let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> way, self-defense is a right eventually exerted by almost all living creature, perhaps it would not be wrong to admit that it is the part of those eternal source which adm fundamental law, the first law of the nature to which all other law are subordinate. A state as a subject under international law has absolute right of self under customary international law but also under UN Charter. With the change in nature of international politics and the method of waging war whether the state practice of self become a privilege or a priority? With every action of negligenc of exercising the right to self of the executing the right of self objection on this right of the state.

The 38th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 28, 1996 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with Boyz II Men, she sang a live rendition of [...] "One Sweet Day", to a very positive response. However, as the award winners were announced one by one, Carey watched as her name was not called up even once. Daydream had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the [...] "album of the year". With every passing loss, the television cameras continued to zoom on Carey's face, who was finding it more difficult to retain her smile. By the end of the night, Carey had not won a single award. The disappointment on her face was painfully obvious. While Carey was nominated again the following year, she did not perform again until the 2006 ceremony, when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{enforcement}} of EC environmental law by decentralized authorities. Obviously {{this is a}} complicated matter. A recent study of the Commission of the European Community, for example, shows {{that in many cases}} swimming water in the Netherlands does not meet the requirements laid down in the EC Bath Water Directive. According to a report in the Dutch newspaper NRC-Handelsblad of 15 june 1995, the Commission stated that only two thirds of the Dutch swimming water is in accordance with the required minimum quality of the directive. This failure {{is a good example of}} the problems relating to enforcement of the environmental standards laid down in EC directives and regulations. Nevertheless, I want to discuss the following question: what are the requirements imposed by EC law on decentralized authorities enforcing EC Environmental law? How must decentralized authorities respond to an infringement of European environmental law? This is the central question of this article. Or let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, some aspects of this question will be discussed. It is impossible, of course, to answer this question completely in a short paper.

The structure of this article is as follows. First, the meaning of some definitions will be explained. Secondly, I will make some general remarks on the role of decentralized authorities in EC law. Thirdly, the general requirements for the enforcement of EC law will be discussed. In the fourth place, I will examine to what extent and in what way decentralized authorities are obliged to monitor compliance with EC environmental law. How can they exercise control over the observance of EC environmental standards? In the fifth place, the sanctions imposed by decentralized authorities will be discussed. Finally, I will draw some conclusions...|$|E
