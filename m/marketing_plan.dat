5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> has received considerable attention {{over the last}} decades. However, the traditional, synoptic approach predominates in the existing literature. Empirical research on behavioural aspects of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process is still scarce {{although there are some}} important theoretical achievement within the behavioural approach. This paper aims to fill in this gap by addressing the problem of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> system structure and relationships between its elements. The conceptual framework for our empirical model of firm’s <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> system is grounded on theoretical assumptions originated from both traditional, synoptic as well as behavioural perspectives. Our empirical assessment, conducted in 101 large Polish companies, reveals the existence of significant correlations between analytical dimension of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> (i. e. comprehensiveness, information and formalization) and its behavioural aspects (participation and attitudes). Our findings also prove that <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process has impact on ultimate marketing effects (firm’s market orientation and performance). This paper contributes to the field of marketing management (particularly to its effectiveness stream) and supports the notion on manageability of both analytical and behavioural dimensions of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process...|$|R

In fact, a majority of Pro League clubs fail to have a <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> and a lack presence within their respective communities, which has significantly impacted crowd attendances and ability for clubs to earn sufficient revenue. Consequently, the league has witnessed a high team turnover with seven clubs suspending their football operations and withdrawing from the Pro League during a four-year period, citing financial difficulties and inability to secure long-term sponsors.|$|E

Several Italian cyclists were hired, who were supposed to come to France. Only one Italian cyclist showed up, Ottavio Bottecchia, who had started as a professional the year before. The sponsor then decided that the <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> would not work with only one Italian cyclist, and wanted to send him back.

40|$|The {{rationale}} {{for this study}} was the apparent difference between the <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> practices of Scottish SME's and the <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> practices recommended by management theory. The direction of this study was adaptedf rom two broad objectives: (i) To assess if, how, and why Scottish small and medium sized businesses go about strategic marketing planning; and (ii) To ascertain whether business performance is affected by participation in the <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process. To address the research issues raised regarding <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> practice and its link with business performance, a conceptual framework that incorporated elements of the traditional strategic <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> process model suggested by the literature and also allowed for the marketing characteristics of SME's was developed. The research design involved a longitudinal survey of 626 Scottish SME's in 1990 and 183 of the same businesses in 1996. This study found that the incidence of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> was significantly linked to business size supporting a number of authors who identify that business size has a direct influence on the nature of <b>marketing</b> and <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> practice. The research highlighted differences in the incidence of <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> across the three SME size categories. In assessing the planning-performance relationship 4 categories of SME's were defined according to their planning behaviour 1990 - 1996. These categories were Planners; Non-Planners; Embracers; and Disavowed. Analysis of these groups showed a significant positive relationship between planning and performance providing empirical support to case that <b>marketing</b> <b>planning</b> improves business performance...|$|R

They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a <b>marketing</b> <b>plan.</b> The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title [...] "Fight Club" [...] embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered [...] "a bad joke" [...] by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Entertainment broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.

[...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings.

500|$|Though the Dreamcast launch {{had been}} successful, Sony still held 60 {{percent of the}} overall video game market share in North America with the PlayStation {{at the end of}} 1999. On March 2, 1999, in what one report called a [...] "highly publicized, vaporware-like announcement" [...] Sony {{revealed}} the first details of its [...] "next generation PlayStation", which Ken Kutaragi claimed would allow video games to convey unprecedented emotions. The center of Sony's <b>marketing</b> <b>plan</b> and the upcoming PlayStation 2 itself was a new CPU (clocked at 294MHz) jointly developed by Sony and Toshiba—the [...] "Emotion Engine"—which Kutaragi announced would feature a graphics processor with 1,000 times more bandwidth than contemporary PC graphics processors and a floating-point calculation performance of 6.2 gigaflops, rivaling most supercomputers. Sony, which invested $1.2 billion in two large-scale integration semiconductor fabrication plants to manufacture the PlayStation 2's [...] "Emotion Engine" [...] and [...] "Graphics Synthesizer", designed the machine to push more raw polygons than any video game console in history. Sony claimed the PlayStation 2 could render 75 million raw polygons per second with absolutely no effects, and 38 million without accounting for features such as textures, artificial intelligence, or physics. With such effects, Sony estimated the PlayStation 2 could render 7.5 million to 16 million polygons per second, whereas independent estimates ranged from 3 million to 20 million, compared to Sega's estimates of more than 3 million to 6 million for the Dreamcast. The system would also utilize the DVD-ROM format, which could hold substantially more data than the Dreamcast's GD-ROM format. Because it could connect to the Internet while playing movies, music, and video games, Sony hyped PlayStation 2 as the future of home entertainment. Rumors spread that the PlayStation 2 was a supercomputer capable of guiding missiles and displaying Toy Story-quality graphics, while Kutaragi boasted its online capabilities would give consumers the ability to [...] "jack into ‘The Matrix’!" [...] In addition, Sony emphasized that the PlayStation 2 would be backwards compatible with hundreds of popular PlayStation games. Sony's specifications appeared to render the Dreamcast obsolete months before its U.S. launch, although reports later emerged that the PlayStation 2 was not as powerful as expected and distinctly difficult to program games for. The same year, Nintendo announced that its next generation console would meet or exceed anything on the market, and Microsoft began development of its own console.|$|E
