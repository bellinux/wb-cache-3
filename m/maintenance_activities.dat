40|$|The {{activity}} {{travel patterns}} {{of individuals in}} a household are inter-related, and the realistic modeling of activity-travel behavior requires that these interdependencies be explicitly accommodated. This paper examines household interactions impacting weekday in-home and out-of-home <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> generation in active, nuclear family, households. The in-home <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> generation is modeled by examining the duration invested by {{the male and female}} household heads in household chores using a seemingly unrelated regression modeling system. The out-of-home <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> generation is modeled in terms of the decision of the household to undertake shopping, allocation of the task to one or both household heads, and the duration of shopping for the person(s) allocated the responsibility. A joint mixed-logit hazard-duration model structure is developed and applied to the modeling of out-of-home <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> generation. The results indicate that traditional gender roles continue to exist and, in particular, non-working {{women are more likely to}} share a large burden of the household maintenance tasks. The model for out-of-home <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> generation indicates that joint activity participation in the case of shopping is motivated by resourc...|$|R

25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After eclosion males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony <b>maintenance</b> <b>activities</b> while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give them an opportunity to do so in natural populations.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>activities</b> vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast Crocodile Management program and captured over 100 crocodiles, some of which were relocated, while others were housed at the family park.

2500|$|Relationship <b>maintenance</b> <b>activities</b> are a {{critical}} component to maintaining high quality relationships. [...] While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one {{may be in a}} skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted. [...] This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and will not be as prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors. [...] As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.|$|E

Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation {{in each of the}} six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 91 - 96. This study {{considers a}} scheduling problem with position-dependent deteriorating jobs and a <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> {{in a single}} machine. Even {{in the absence of}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity</b> and deterioration problem is NP-hard. A solution comprises the following: (i) positions of jobs, (ii) the position of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity,</b> (iii) starting time of the first job in the schedule. After the <b>maintenance</b> <b>activity,</b> machine will revert to its initial condition and deterioration will start anew. The objective is to minimize the total weighted earliness and tardiness costs. Jobs scheduled before (after) the due-date are penalized according to their earliness (tardiness) value. Polynomial (O(n log n)) time solutions are provided for some special cases. No polynomial solution exists for instances with tight due-dates. We propose a mixed integer programming model and efficient algorithms for the cases where mathematical formulation is not efficient in terms of computational time requirements. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms perform well in terms of both solution quality and computation time. Şirvan, FatmaM. S...|$|R
