Contrary to microcredit, <b>microsaving</b> has not received much attention in the empirical literature yet which {{can be explained by}} a lack of reliable household data. The paper uses panel data to account for individual unobserved effects that can lead to substantial biases when not being controlled for. I find that when controlling for self-selection, no significant impacts of the program can be observed and that naive estimates, which do not account for selection biases, severely overstate program impacts.

Inspired by ROSCAs, we offer different credit and savings contracts to subjects. We find that individuals often accept both credit and saving contract across experimental waves.

40|$|Microfinance {{in general}} and {{microcredit}} programs in particular have attracted much attention among interest groups concerned with poverty eradication and are {{seen by many as}} highly promising means in order to alleviate poverty. More recently, the spotlight has turned increasingly on the development and promotion of <b>microsaving</b> devices and mechanisms suitable to the unbanked poor. Along these lines, the Saving Mobilization program implemented by BRAC in Uganda is an attempt to encourage a saving culture as well as overcoming barriers to make use of saving services at more formal financial institutions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} studies in macroeconomics, microfinance, entrepreneurship, financial technology innovation (FinTech), and economic development. In particular, I study unbanked problems and evaluate microfinance programs. Chapter 1 studies quantitatively how a microfinance {{program in the}} U. S. affects occupational choice, firm size, credit access, wages, output, inequality and welfare. The general equilibrium model has heterogeneous agents, a bank with a minimum loan size requirement and a microfinance institution (MFI) with a loan interest rate that exceeds the bank 2 ̆ 7 s. Four microfinance program policies are evaluated: alternative minimum loan size requirements, changes in the loan cost wedge (due to innovation or regulation), changes {{to the level of}} the government subsidy, and alternative MFI sustainability requirements. We find that MFIs can have significant welfare effects for some individuals. In Chapter 2, I introduce a <b>microsavings</b> program for low-wealth individuals in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. The model incorporates that (i) traditional banks require a minimum savings deposit size, causing some individuals to become “unbanked, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 and (ii) banks and non-profits partner to offer <b>microsavings</b> programs to the unbanked. The paper finds that <b>microsavings</b> programs increase the percentage of entrepreneurs by providing collateral that the previously unbanked can use to start firms, and wages increase, which benefits workers. Second, government subsidies for <b>microsavings</b> programs expand the size and number of firms, but output and workers may decline when funding the program requires higher income taxes. Third, bank sector deregulation (i. e., lower transaction costs in the financial sector) leads to higher output per capita, wages, and firm numbers, and possibly lower income inequality among entrepreneurs. Finally, technological innovations that decrease deposit transaction costs, such as mobile banking, reduce funding pressure on <b>microsavings</b> programs, but have little effect on the percentage of entrepreneurs, firm size, entrepreneur returns or wages...|$|R

40|$|This paper mainly {{focuses on}} finding optimal {{strategies}} {{for the development of}} microfinance in Korea and on predicting the impact of microfinance in the future. First, this paper reviews and assesses the impact of microfinance in Korea. I suggested that recent phenomena of income polarization and credit rationing in the financial market are evidence that microfinance is needed in Korea. Although the Korean economy has made great strides, the difference in the income between the poor and the rich has gotten much greater. The foreign currency crisis in 1997 deepened income polarization and the impact is continuing. Banks choose to ration credit instead of increasing interest rate (when there was an excess demand for loans) which would lead adverse selection and moral hazards. The poor are in an inferior position when it comes to getting funds when credit ration happens because they cannot offer collateral and they need money urgently. This paper analyzes the factors which impact up on the survival of microenterprises using two econometric methods (the logit regression model and the Cox proportional hazard model). Attributes of microenterprises, such as organizational form, sex of the owner(s), income level of the owner(s), and types of business are chosen as independent variables which may have impact on the survival. The results from the econometric models indicate that more support should be provided when the income level of the owner(s) became less if we want to make more microenterprises survive. The direction of impact or the relative magnitudes of impact is not exactly the same between two econometric methods. Therefore, proper interpretation and fine tuning are needed in applying the results into the real microcredit world. Next, this paper outlines the impact of microfinance on the income level of the poor and the repayment ratio of microcredit. This task is carried out by a simulation which is an agent based model. The simulation of the agent based model shows that two different policy directions are needed to guarantee the success of microfinance. First, it is necessary to magnify positive impacts. There are at least two ways this can be done. You can increase the amount of microcredit {{to make it easier to}} start businesses and you can support an increase in the yield rate of return. Minimizing negative impacts is also important. This can be done by decreasing the interest rate charged by local money lenders and closely monitoring their behavior to see if they obey the usury law. Finally, I proposed several optimal {{strategies for the}} development of microfinance in the future. (1) Introducing and enforcing group lending, because group lending can solve two major problems in microfinance, adverse selection by assortative matching and moral hazard by monitoring group members??? transactions. (2) Letting MFIs (Microfinance Institutions) carry out both <b>microsaving</b> and microinsurance. (3) Establishing independent committees to mediate disputes regarding microcredit issues, which can solve commitment problem. (4) Expanding microfinance services by letting MFIs handle housing microfinance and loans for education and health care. (5) Encouraging social enterprise to help the poor overcome their state of poverty. In conclusion, appropriate social objectives and forward looking entrepreneurship when properly supported by MFIs can bring remarkable progress in social integration and help the poor overcome their state of poverty...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{one of the}} {{greatest}} public health challenges of the 21 st century is managing the health of populations in the context of rapid urbanization and the growth of slums in the cities of the global south. Slums are characterized by insecure residential status, poor structural quality of housing, overcrowding, and inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and other infrastructure. Currently, 828 million people live in slums [...] growing, living and working in conditions that threaten their health. Demographers predict that in the next 30 years, the urban population in the cities of the global south will double, further compounding the problem. Slum dwellers experience poor health {{as a result of a}} complex and intertwined set of social, economic, physical and political factors, a fact underscored by a growing body of research demonstrating health disparities between slum dwellers and their urban counterparts. In order to address the challenge of poor health in slums, global public health practitioners must be prepared to grapple with these complexities, both in terms of analyzing how health is shaped and in terms of responding to the factors that shape health in such places. In this dissertation, I contribute to a growing body of knowledge focused on analyzing and responding to health in informal settlements. In the following papers, I describe health in informal settlements, drawing from the literature to describe slum specific social determinants of health. I probe deeper into understanding health in slums by using empirical data and employing the relational framework to analyze health in a specific place, the Mathare informal settlement in Kenya. Here, I examine which living conditions matter for health and how, integrating the voices of slum dwellers to better understand how health is shaped. I find that health in slums is a function of complex and interrelated social, economic, physical and political factors. I take a similar approach in exploring <b>microsavings,</b> a potential response to the complex determinants of health in slums. First, I draw from the literature to develop a theory for how <b>microsavings</b> may play a role in addressing health in slums, and delve deeper into how this may occur by conducting a case study examining four <b>microsavings</b> groups in Mathare. I find that <b>microsavings</b> has the potential to build health in informal settlements through five specific pathways: facilitating empowerment, building community, creating information and action networks, amplifying the voice of the poor, and building financial strength...|$|R

30|$|However, {{there are}} many {{informal}} sector <b>microsavings</b> institutions on which very little data is available. For example in Ethiopia, there are community-based organizations such as Ekub, a system of forced saving, with finance secured through traders, friends, and relatives; and Iddir, informal associations where members save for funeral costs (Belwal et al. 2012). Similarly, there are susu schemes in West Africa (Adusei and Appiah 2012).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the types of programs, partnerships and policies UNHCR should support to improve microcredit and <b>microsavings</b> for urban refugees in the informal economy. I set out to accomplish this purpose in partnership with the Women’s Refugee Commission, an evidence-based advocacy organization that advocates vigorously for laws, policies and programs to improve the lives and protect the rights of refugee and internally displaced women, children and young people, including those seeking asylum—bringing about lasting, measurable change. Though independent, WRC often collaborates with UNHCR and other stakeholders to determine better practices and approaches for protecting refugees, especially women and youth. There are approximately 10. 5 million refugees worldwide, more than half of who live in urban areas and only a third in camps. Refugees in protracted situations make up 68 % of the refugee population, meaning they are not sure when or if they will return home. The average length of their displacement is 17 years, hardly a length of time appropriate for short-term, humanitarian interventions. The trend of urbanization does not apply exclusively to refugees. More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, 1. 5 billion living in poor urban and slum areas. Urban refugees typically live in the same communities as urban poor. Both groups operate primarily in the informal economy, face bribery and harassment from police, and have inadequate social safety nets such as healthcare, education and housing. Women are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and gender-based violence under these circumstances. Refugees face additional challenges as they often do not have proper documentation, clear legal status or rights to work, or move as do their host neighbors. These challenges result in additional protection concerns and obstacles to generating an income and becoming self-reliant. Microcredit and <b>microsavings</b> are approaches that development actors are exploring to help protect and reduce poverty among urban poor, but urban refugees are often left out of these microfinance schemes. Refugees have expressed the need for microcredit to grow their informal businesses, and <b>microsavings</b> schemes to help establish financial security. Utilizing financial services could help many refugees achieve self-reliance. I identified four categories where UNHCR can support microfinance: partnerships, programming, policy and evaluation and advocacy. I developed nine different options within these categories and analyzed them against three criteria: ensure political feasibility, consider UNHCR’s financial limitations, balance refugee protection concerns with economic stability. I ultimately recommend all nine options for UNHCR to consider for implementation. Partnerships 1. 	Strengthen and increase partnerships with international and national development actors and host government ministries to carry out microfinance programs. 2. 	Strengthen and increase partnerships between field officers, country staff, city officials and development groups to carry out microfinance programs. Programming 3. 	Pilot microcredit and <b>microsavings</b> programs in select urban locations over longer project time horizons. Emphasize <b>microsavings</b> first and more broadly, and only apply credit to refugees who meet the appropriate criteria. Use both sustainable MFI models and subsidized and non-financial service models depending on the needs of the population in the pilot location. 4. 	Build the capacity of field officers, implementing partners and future MFI partners to successfully extend microfinance services to urban refugees. 5. 	Pilot guaranteeing loans for refugees who show potential to start and grow a scalable business and who could then hire other refugees and urban poor. Policy and Evaluation 6. 	Allow UNHCR staff to commit funds to microfinance projects for up to five years before having to request an extension for project funds. 7. 	Rigorously monitor and evaluate not just the financial, but also the social impact of microfinance programs for urban refugees. Advocacy 8. 	Lobby donors for increased self-reliance and livelihood funds intended to support and partner with existing MFIs, government agencies and development NGOs in order to offer more savings and credit options to refugees. 9. 	Continue advocacy efforts with host national and local governments and MFIs. Use messages of self-reliance and contributions to local economic development. The goal of advocacy should be to ensure an enabling environment for work and financial services for refugees. UNHCR has issued guidance and explored microfinance previously in a limited number of ways. However, my recommendations apply specifically to urban refugees predominantly in non-conflict settings. UNHCR and development actors have tended to focus primarily on microcredit. However, credit should be applied cautiously to refugees who meet specific criteria. <b>Microsavings</b> is a more appropriate approach for a wider range of refugees, especially the poor and vulnerable who risk going into debt. The poorest and most vulnerable often need a graduation model of financial services. Another approach for the poorest requires the provision of social services like healthcare, education, business training, or one-time asset transfers alongside credit and savings. Credit or savings alone is not the solution for refugees to protect themselves or grow their household income. Advocacy, policy changes and partnerships are necessary as UNCHR and WRC move forward in supporting microfinance programs for urban refugees in the informal economy...|$|R

30|$|Microfinance is the {{provision}} of financial services to the financially excluded, usually the poor. We use literature reviews and descriptive research to present {{different aspects of the}} relationship of the microfinancial services to microenterprise. The first thrust in this field had been from microcredit and group lending to encourage business initiatives among the poor. The hope that these services would lift them out of poverty had largely built the brand image of the sector. However, the spread of consumer microcredit and uncontrolled growth of microfinance led to over-lending without adequate checks and balances, leading to over-indebtedness and associated stress, and critique of microcredit. To restore balance, other financial products, such as microequity, <b>microsavings,</b> microinsurance, microguarantees, and microremittances, have been suggested. We place these developments in a social innovation process perspective by showing that microfinance, through its wide range of innovatively distributed products, can be a key factor to foster entrepreneurship.|$|R
40|$|In {{tandem with}} the growth of microloans and <b>microsavings,</b> {{insurance}} policies geared towards low-income households have also become increasingly widespread over the past decade in developing and emerging countries. There is hope that microinsurance will allow large segments of the population who lack access to government social security to insure themselves against adverse life events, thus helping to safeguard their economic well-being. Yet much work is to be done if this goal is to be attained. On the one hand, the availability of microinsurance is still extremely limited. On the other hand, potential and current microinsurance customers do not place much trust in insurance providers. They also lack knowledge about specific insurance products, as shown by our investigation of a microinsurance policy in Ghana. Yet another factor is that many commercial insurers still have not managed to adapt to the particularities of the microinsurance market. Microinsurance, Low-income households, Risk, Ghana...|$|R
