25|$|DNA <b>microarray</b> is a {{bioinformatics}} tool used {{to quantify}} expression levels of various genes simultaneously, {{and has been}} used extensively {{in the study of}} adipose tissue. One such study used <b>microarray</b> analysis in conjunction with Ingenuity IPA software to look at changes in WAT and BAT gene expression when mice were exposed to temperatures of 28 and 6°C. The most significantly up- and downregulated genes were then identified and used for analysis of differentially expressed pathways. It was discovered that many of the pathways upregulated in WAT after cold exposure are also highly expressed in BAT, such as oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. This suggests that some of the adipocytes switched to a beige phenotype at 6°C. Mössenböck et al. also used <b>microarray</b> analysis to demonstrate that insulin deficiency inhibits the differentiation of beige adipocytes but does not disturb their capacity for browning.

25|$|A more {{sensitive}} approach to transcript {{analysis of a}} gene is quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which has also seen action in quantifying protease mRNA levels. Again, total RNA is extracted and used to generate cDNA for PCR amplification. As {{long as there is}} a specific primer for a protease, protease inhibitor, or interacting molecule, qRT-PCR can serve as a highly sensitive method to detect minuscule amounts of mRNA copy numbers per cell. A drawback that separates it from <b>microarray</b> analysis is its limited scope: a <b>microarray</b> can handle parallel analysis of multiple genes while qRT-PCR must amplify one mRNA for analysis at a time. It also suffers from the same limitation of <b>microarray</b> analysis regarding the lack of correlation between transcript and protein levels.

25|$|Transcriptomics {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both <b>microarray</b> and RNA-Seq experiments. <b>Microarray</b> data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. <b>Microarray</b> raw image files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must be aligned to reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple transcriptomics experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed <b>microarray</b> intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can be uploaded via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E
