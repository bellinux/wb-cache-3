50|$|Artex {{differs from}} plaster {{in that it}} was marketed as a <b>material</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> receive a {{textured}} finish, thus enabling a ceiling to be finished without plastering skills.

50|$|Promised {{compensation}} for resettled peasants {{was not always}} forthcoming and instead found its way {{in the pockets of}} South Vietnamese government officials. Peasants were promised wages for their labor building the new villages and fortifications; some corrupt officials kept the money for themselves. Wealthier peasants sometimes bribed their way out of working on construction, leaving more labor for the poorer peasants. Although the U.S. provided materials like sheet metal and barbed wire, corrupt officials sometimes forced the locals to buy the <b>materials</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> provide them with protection.|$|E
50|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} presents a versatile response to treat bone injuries and deformations. Nanofibers produced via electrospinning mimics the architecture {{and characteristics of}} natural extracellular matrix particularly well. These scaffolds {{can be used to}} deliver bioactive agents that promote tissue regeneration. These bioactive materials should ideally be osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osseointegratable. Bone substitute <b>materials</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> replace autologous or allogeneic bone consist of bioactive ceramics, bioactive glasses, and biological and synthetic polymers. The basis of bone {{tissue engineering}} is that the materials will be resorbed and replaced over time by the body’s own newly regenerated biological tissue.|$|E

5000|$|Fonts {{designed}} for legibility often have very open apertures, keeping the strokes widely separated {{from one another}} to reduce ambiguity. This may be especially important in situations such as signs to be viewed at a distance, <b>materials</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be viewed by people with vision problems, or small print, especially on poor-quality paper. Fonts with open apertures include Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Corbel and Droid Sans, all {{designed for}} use on low-resolution displays, and Frutiger, FF Meta and others designed for print use. This design trend has become increasingly common with the spread of humanist sans-serif designs since the 1980s and the 1990s {{and the use of}} computers requiring new fonts which are legible on-screen. Helvetica can’t do everything...it can be really weak in small sizes. Shapes like ‘C’ and ‘S’ curl back into themselves, leaving tight [...] "apertures"—the channels of white between a letter’s interior and exterior... The lowercase ‘e,' the most common letter in English and many other languages, takes an especially unobliging form. These and other letters can be a pixel away from being some other letter. Tobias Frere-Jones Realist or neo-grotesque sans-serif fonts like Helvetica use very closed apertures, folding up stroke ends to make them closer together. This gives these designs a distinctive, compact appearance, but may make similar letterforms hard to distinguish. Closed letterforms on highly condensed realist designs such as Impact and Haettenschweiler make characters such as 8 and 9 almost indistinguishable at small print sizes. Designer Nick Shinn has suggested that the cause of this design trend, similar to the Didone serif typefaces of the nineteenth century, may have been the desire to distribute the pressure of the printing press on the type, reducing wear.|$|E
