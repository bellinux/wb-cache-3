5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the <b>mother</b> <b>ship,</b> and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Kator {{leaves the}} house and calls his <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> on an alien transceiver. Hungrily {{watching}} two girls walk along the river, he advises his superiors to dispatch more of his kind to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{party is}} warped {{back to the}} top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers George's grave. Large rocks block the {{entrance}} to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's conscience. The party encounters the <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship</b> and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship.</b> When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and flies off in the <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship.</b> The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E

Spielberg's friends Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins cameo as two World War II pilots returning from the <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> Real-life ARP technician Phil Dodds cameos as the operator of the ARP 2500 synthesizer communicating with the alien ship. Musician Jerry Garcia also makes an {{appearance in}} the crowd scene. Carl Weathers appeared as {{a soldier in the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with this}} knowledge, the group, now led by Dolarhyde, prepares {{to attack the}} aliens' {{grounded}} <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> Meanwhile, Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. After the humans maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and destroying it by using Jake's wrist gauntlet as a bomb, obliterating the ship.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the <b>mother</b> <b>ship,</b> the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{was used}} in filming the 1950 film, Morning Departure, a naval film directed by Roy Ward Baker. During the course of filming, the submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone {{was used as a}} <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> for Tiptoe. In 1952 a further cinematic link was made when ballet dancer Moira Shearer presented a pair of size 3.5 satin ballet shoes to Tiptoe that she had worn in the 1948 film The Red Shoes. These are now at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Whilst in Tromsø harbour on 18 July 1955 Tiptoe was damaged when a coastal steamer collided with her. The steamer, a 2,162 tonne vessel called Nordlys, was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer HMS Chevron. The steamer bounced off the destroyer and collided with Tiptoe, snapping her moorings as she was pushed halfway under a wooden quay.|$|E
50|$|The barquentine, Gazela Primeiro, {{while not}} a schooner, {{was one of}} the last of the dory <b>mother</b> <b>ships.</b> She had a long {{association}} with dories and the Grand Banks cod industry and made her final voyage in 1969.Banks dories have been capable of surviving long voyages, some unintentional, when the fishermen became separated from their <b>mother</b> <b>ships.</b> One of the more famous adventures was by Howard Blackburn, who survived 5 days in the North Atlantic in January.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>ships</b> {{can carry}} small submersibles and {{submarines}} {{to an area}} of ocean to be explored (such as the Atlantis II carrying the Alvin).|$|R
50|$|The Sen'yu-Ko or Sen'yu-Shō type (Transport {{submarine}} small type) were transport submarines. Several of {{this type}} were converted to tankers or to <b>mother</b> <b>ships</b> for the midget submarines.|$|R
5|$|After finding {{most of the}} Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, {{the boss}} of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party {{with the intent to}} avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is {{attacked}} by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship</b> to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody. After learning this melody, the party is warped to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies he had learned to Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song and reminisces about an alien named Gyiyg that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.|$|E

5000|$|A {{small number}} of Languedocs were used as flying testbeds and <b>mother</b> <b>ships,</b> {{succeeding}} the pair of He 274 prototype airframes {{left behind by the}} Luftwaffe in 1944 that were partly being used as [...] "mother ships" [...] for high-speed French aerodynamic research aircraft, with four Languedocs being used as <b>mother</b> <b>ships</b> for René Leduc's experimental ramjet aircraft in place of the hard-to-maintain He 274s, themselves scrapped by the French in 1953. Languedocs were also used for other types of experimental work including an unsuccessful use as live airborne television relay for Charles de Gaulles's Algerian visit in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Both {{military}} and civilian midget submarines have been built. Military types work with surface ships and other submarines as <b>mother</b> <b>ships.</b> Civilian and non-combatant military types are generally called submersibles, and normally work with surface ships.|$|R
25|$|At this time, the Finnish Navy {{already had}} the new vessels Riilahti and Ruotsinsalmi, and they now took the {{responsibility}} of laying mines instead of the outdated Louhi, which served as a <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> to submarines and an escort to merchant ships.|$|E
