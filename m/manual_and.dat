5|$|Rotary fan, <b>manual</b> <b>and</b> water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E

An installation <b>manual</b> <b>and</b> release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the <b>manual,</b> <b>and</b> put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

5|$|As Allen's {{first-class}} career {{came to a}} close, {{he moved}} into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He {{was instrumental in the}} creation of a MCC coaching <b>manual,</b> <b>and</b> worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's Cricket Ground, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.|$|E
5|$|As {{the third}} {{son of a}} cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was {{prepared}} for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military <b>manual,</b> <b>and</b> {{came into contact with}} important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, {{by the time he was}} ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge <b>Manual</b> <b>and</b> its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} security was split between {{foreign and domestic}} branches.

S. embassies, legations and consulates overseas. As Chief of the Division, Uanna {{was responsible for the}} security of all State's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad. He was responsible for the security for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip's visit to the United States in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed <b>manual),</b> <b>and</b> a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
