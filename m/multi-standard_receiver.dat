40|$|Abstract—There is an {{increasing}} demand for single user equipment (UE) supporting multi standards in third generation communication systems and beyond. Nevertheless, integrating several standards in one UE increases the front-end design complexity due to the coexistence of several systems.

By considering the system issues, multi-standard operation and interfering effects in a multi-standard transceiver supporting UMTS and WLAN, the receiver requirements have been derived based on the existing 3 GPP specifications. The derived constrains are generally valid {{for all types of}} receiver architectures. Therefore, they are applicable for selection of components such as LNAs and filters in a <b>multi-standard</b> <b>receiver</b> front-end regardless of the chosen architecture. I...|$|E

A desired signal can {{be accompanied by}} significantly stronger out-of band interferers or blockers, which can severely degrade a receiver's sensitivity through gain compression of the blocks in the receiver chain. This work presents a new Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) low-pass filter architecture which seeks to solve the out-of-band blocker problem of the existing architectures. A higher order filtering is embedded within the TIA {{in the form of}} an active feedback to provide more attenuation to out-of-band blockers. The active feedback circuitry feeds back an equivalent amount of current to the input node to cancel out incoming out-of-band blockers while maintaining an acceptable voltage swing at the output of the TIA. The proposed TIA filter has a channel bandwidth of 20 MHz, and can processes interferers of +/- 10 mA fully differential without saturating the opamps.

40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communication systems into multi-standard radio architectures that can process {{a multitude of}} frequency bands and modulation schemes has lead to a growing demand for wideband receiver front-ends. To allow for portability and low cost, these new architectures {{also need to be}} low power, compact size integrated circuits with a higher degree of components integrated on chip.
