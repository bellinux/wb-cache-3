40|$|Abstract: Why {{inflammatory}} responses become chronic and how adjuvants work remain unanswered. Macrophage-lineage {{cells are}} {{key components of}} chronic inflammatory reactions and in the actions of immunologic adjuvants. One explanation for the increased numbers of macrophages long term at sites of chronic inflammation could be enhanced cell survival or even local proliferation. The evidence supporting a unifying hypothesis for {{one way in which}} this macrophage survival and proliferation may be promoted is presented. Many materials, often particulate, of which macrophages have difficulty disposing, can promote monocyte/macrophage survival and even proliferation. Materials active in this regard and which can initiate chronic inflammatory reactions include oxidized low-density lipoprotein, inflammatory microcrystals (calcium <b>phosphate,</b> <b>monosodium</b> urate, talc, calcium pyrophosphate), amyloidogenic peptides (amyloid � and prion protein), and joint implant biomaterials. Additional, similar materials, which have been shown to have adjuvant activity (alum, oil-in-water emulsions, heat-killed bacteria, CpG oligonucleotides, methylated bovine serum albumin, silica), induce similar responses. Cell proliferation can be striking, following uptake of some of the materials, when macrophage-colony stimulating factor is included at low concentrations, which normally promote mainly survival. It is proposed that if such responses were occurring in vivo, there would be a shift in the normal balance between cell survival and cell death, which maintains steady-state, macrophage-lineage numbers in tissues. Thus, there would be more cells in an inflammatory lesion or at a site of adjuvant action with the potential, following activation and/or differentiation, to perpetuate inflammatory or antigen-specific, immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{careful and}} {{individualized}} evaluation of metabolic {{risk factors and}} exclusion of anatomic renal abnormalities is a fundamental part of the medical management of the patients with kidney stones. The simplified evaluation requires a single 24 -hour urine sample collected on a random diet for a complete stone risk analysis, whereas for a comprehensive evaluation three 24 -hour collections are recommended for the measurements of stone risk factors that includes hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia, hypomagnesuria, uric acid and relative supersaturation with respect to calcium oxalate, calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>monosodium</b> urate, uric acid, struvite and estimation of creatinine, ammonium and electrolytes. Thus, an accurate diagnosis of stone disease from the tests interpretation {{is the basis for}} designing an efficient and rational therapeutic program for the medical management of kidney stones and reduction of recurrent stone formation. Potassium citrate alone or with thiazide or indapamide, combined with dietary modification and water or fluid intake more than 3 liters per day (to produce more than 2 liters of urine per day) is the most effective therapy in the management of the patients with kidney stones and prevention of further stone formation. A high animal protein diet causes hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and bone loss confirming an acid load. Potassium-rich fruit juices increase the urinary pH and citrate by producing an alkali load. In normal subjects, a high calcium diet does not increase the urinary saturation of calcium oxalate. Dietary oxalate restriction prevents secondary rise in urinary oxalate, thiazide or indapamide reduces the urinary calcium, potassium citrate increases the urinary the citrate and pH. The rise in urinary pH retards uric acid precipitation by increasing its solubility. Dietary calcium intake is restricted only in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria. Identification of the stone risk factors is the key to medical management of the kidney stones and the prevention of their recurrence...|$|R
