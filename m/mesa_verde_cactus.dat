40|$|Although the {{communities}} of the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region were largely self-sufficient economically, they were never isolated from events taking place elsewhere in the Southwest. This was especially true in the Pueblo II period, from 900 to 1150 CE. The <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> people watched from a distance as complex communities dominated by monumental “great houses” developed in Chaco Canyon to the south. As time went on, they became increasingly involved with Chaco, and a small Chaco-style great house came to be a central feature of many <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> communities. Then, in the early 1100 s a massive great-house complex was built at Aztec, {{in what is now}} northwestern New Mexico. It signaled that the seat of Chacoan influence and power had moved north to the Totah area, {{in the southern part of}} the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region (see map, p. viii). Despite being drawn into the large-scale Chacoan system, the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> people maintained their distinctive culture, inventing new ways of doing things while continuing long-standing traditions.
