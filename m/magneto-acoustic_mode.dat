40|$|Solar chromospheric {{observations}} of sunspot umbrae offer an exceptional view of magneto-hydrodynamic wave phenomena. In recent years, {{a wealth of}} wave signatures related to propagating magneto-acoustic modes have been presented, which demonstrate complex spatial and temporal structuring of the wave components. Theoretical modelling has demonstrated how these ubiquitous waves are consistent with an m= 0 slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>mode,</b> which are excited by trapped sub-photospheric acoustic (p-mode) waves. However, the spectrum of umbral waves is broad, suggesting that the observed signatures represent the superposition of numerous frequencies and/or modes. We apply Fourier filtering, in both spatial and temporal domains, to extract chromospheric umbral wave characteristics consistent with an m= 1 slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>mode.</b> This identification has not been described before. Angular frequencies of 0. 037 +/- 0. 007 rad/s (2. 1 +/- 0. 4 deg/s), corresponding to a period approximately 170 s for the m= 1 mode are uncovered for spatial wavenumbers {{in the range of}} 0. 45 <k< 0. 90 arcsec^- 1 (5000 - 9000 km). Theoretical dispersion relations are solved, with corresponding eigenfunctions computed, which allows the density perturbations to be investigated and compared with our observations. Such magnetohydrodynamic modelling confirms our interpretation that the identified wave signatures are the first direct {{observations of}} an m= 1 slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>mode</b> in the chromospheric umbra of a sunspot.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of gravitational waves (GW) in a uniformly magnetized plasma at arbitrary angles to the magnetic field. No a priori assumptions are made about the temperature, and we consider both a plasma at rest and a plasma flowing out at ultra-relativistic velocities. In the 3 + 1 orthonormal tetrad description, we find that all three fundamental low-frequency plasma wave modes are excited by the GW. Alfven waves are excited by a x polarized GW, whereas the slow and fast magneto-acoustic modes couple to the + polarization. The slow mode, however, doesn't interact coherently with the GW. The most relevant wave mode is the fast <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>mode</b> which in a strongly magnetized plasma has a vanishingly small phase lag {{with respect to the}} GW allowing for coherent interaction over large length scales. When the background magnetic field is almost, but not entirely, parallel to the GW's direction of propagation even the Alfven waves grow to first order in the GW amplitude. Finally, we calculate the growth of the magneto-acoustic waves and the damping of the GW. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures; Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Waves {{observed}} in the photosphere and chromosphere of sunspots show complex dynamics and spatial patterns. The interpretation of high-resolution sunspot wave observations requires modeling of three-dimensional non-linear wave propagation and mode transformation in the sunspot upper layers in realistic spot model atmospheres. Here we present the first results of such modeling. We have developed a 3 D non-linear numerical code specially designed to calculate the response of magnetic structures in equilibrium to an arbitrary perturbation. The code solves the 3 D nonlinear MHD equations for perturbations; it is stabilized by hyper-diffusivity terms and is fully parallelized. The robustness of the code is demonstrated {{by a number of}} standard tests. We analyze several simulations of a sunspot perturbed by pulses of different periods at subphotospheric level, from short periods, introduced for academic purposes, to longer and realistic periods of three and five minutes. We present {{a detailed description of the}} three-dimensional mode transformation in a non-trivial sunspot-like magnetic field configuration, including the conversion between fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves and the Alfvén wave, by calculation of the wave energy fluxes. Our main findings are the following: (1) the conversion from acoustic to the Alfvén mode is only observed if the the driving pulse is located out of the sunspot axis, but this conversion is energetically inefficient; (2) as a consequence of the cut-off effects and refraction of the fast <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>mode,</b> the energy of the evanescent waves with periods around 5 minutes remains almost completely below the level beta= 1; (3) waves with frequencies above the cut-off propagate field-aligned to the chromosphere and their power becomes dominating over that of evanescent 5 -minute oscillations, in agreement with observations...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{present an}} {{investigation}} into how the cooling of the background plasma influences the propagation of slow and fast MHD wave modes supported by an unbounded, homogenous plasma. Previous investigations {{have suggested that the}} cooling of the plasma and a reduction in density could lead to the damping of fast magneto-acoustic oscillations. We aim to investigate whether cooling of the background plasma at a constant density may be responsible for the damping of slow and fast modes. Methods: The plasma is assumed homogeneous and the background temperature (pressure) is decreasing with time. The temperature change is assumed to be due to optically thin radiation. A special case of the radiative function is chosen to allow an analytical assessment of the effects of cooling on <b>magneto-acoustic</b> MHD <b>modes</b> and ensures the temperature evolution of the background plasma due to this radiation also matches the observed cooling profile of coronal loops. Results: A time-dependent dispersion relation is obtained on the slow timescale of cooling and full time-dependent solutions are found. Leading order equations for the amplitude of the waves are obtained and solved analytically for the slow and fast MHD modes. The cooling of the plasma is found to cause the frequency of the <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>modes</b> to decrease with time. The slow modes are found to experience a greater change in frequency than the fast modes. More importantly, the radiative losses also provide a significant damping of the slow mode and a small damping of the component of the fast mode perpendicular to the magnetic field. The damping of the slow mode is found to be strong within typical lifetimes of oscillations observed in coronal structures. Cooling could have important consequences and needs to be assessed when trying to determine what mechanism is responsible for the observed damping of coronal oscillations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the propagation of}} MHD waves in a homogenous, magnetized plasma in a weakly stratified atmosphere, representing hot coronal loops. In most of earlier studies a time-independent equilibrium is considered. Here we abandon this restriction and allow the equilibrium to develop as function of time. In particular, the background plasma {{is assumed to be}} cooling due to thermal conduction. The cooling is assumed to be on a time scale greater than the characteristic travel times of the perturbations. We {{investigate the}} influence of cooling of the background plasma on the properties of magneto-acoustic waves. The MHD equations are reduced to a 1 -D system modelling <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>modes</b> progressing along a dynamically cooling coronal loop. A time dependent dispersion relation which describes the propagation of the magneto-acoustic waves is derived by using the WKB theory. An analytic solution for the time-dependent amplitude of waves is obtained and the method of characteristics is used to find an approximate analytical solution. Numerical calculations are applied to the analytically derived solutions to obtain further insight into the behavior of the MHD waves in a system with variable, time-dependent background. The results show that there is a strong damping of MHD waves that can be linked to the widely observed damping of hot coronal loop oscillations. The damping also appears to be independent of position along the loop. Studies of MHD wave behaviour in time-dependent background seem to be a fundamental and very important next step in developing MHD wave theory applicable to a wide range in solar physics.

40|$|Here {{we review}} the recent {{progress}} {{made in the}} detection, examination, characterisation and interpretation of oscillations manifesting in small-scale magnetic elements in the solar photosphere. This region of the Sun's atmosphere is especially dynamic, and importantly, permeated {{with an abundance of}} magnetic field concentrations. Such magnetic features can span diameters of hundreds to many tens of thousands of km, and are thus commonly referred to as the `building blocks' of the magnetic solar atmosphere. However, it is the smallest magnetic elements that have risen to the forefront of solar physics research in recent years. Structures, which include magnetic bright points, are often at the diffraction limit of even the largest of solar telescopes. Importantly, it is the improvements in facilities, instrumentation, imaging techniques and processing algorithms during recent years that have allowed researchers to examine the motions, dynamics and evolution of such features on the smallest spatial and temporal scales to date. It is clear that while these structures may demonstrate significant magnetic field strengths, their small sizes make them prone to the buffeting supplied by the ubiquitous surrounding convective plasma motions. Here, it is believed that magnetohydrodynamic waves can be induced, which propagate along the field lines, carrying energy upwards to the outermost extremities of the solar corona. Such wave phenomena can exist in a variety of guises, including fast and slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>modes,</b> in addition to Alfven waves. Coupled with rapid advancements in magnetohydrodynamic wave theory, we are now in an ideal position to thoroughly investigate how wave motion is generated in the solar photosphere, which oscillatory modes are most prevalent, and the role that these waves play in supplying energy to various layers of the solar atmosphere.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of oscillatory phenomena associated with a large bright-point group that is 430, 000 square kilometers in area and located near the solar disk center. Wavelet analysis reveals full-width half-maximum oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99 %. These oscillations, 2. 6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23 kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and transversal displacements rules out the presence of <b>magneto-acoustic</b> wave <b>modes.</b> The oscillations are a signature of Alfven waves produced by a torsional twist of +/- 22 degrees.

40|$|The EIT waves [named {{after the}} Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) ] {{are in the}} {{literature}} usually described as fast <b>magneto-acoustic</b> (FMA) <b>modes.</b> However, observations show that {{a large percentage of}} these events propagate with very slow speeds that may be as low as 20 km/s. This is far below the FMA wave speed which cannot be below the sound speed, the latter being typically larger than $ 10 ^ 2 $ km/s in the corona. In the present study it is shown that, to account for such low propagation speed, a different wave model should be used, based on the theory of gravity waves, both internal (IG) and surface (SG) ones. The gravity modes are physically completely different from the FMA mode, as they are essentially dispersive and in addition the IG wave is a transverse mode. Both the IG and the SG mode separately can provide proper propagation velocities in the whole low speed range. Comment: Phys. Plasmas (2011...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} and discuss results of {{two-dimensional}} simulations of linear and nonlinear magneto-acoustic wave propagation {{through an open}} magnetic flux tube embedded in the solar atmosphere expanding from the photosphere through to the transition region and into the low corona. Our aim is to model and analyze the response of such a magnetic structure to vertical and horizontal periodic motions originating in the photosphere. To carry out the simulations, we employed our MHD code SAC (Sheffield Advanced Code). A combination of the VALIIIC and McWhirter solar atmospheres and coronal density profiles were used as the background equilibrium model in the simulations. Vertical and horizontal harmonic sources, located at the footpoint region of the open magnetic flux tube, are incorporated in the calculations, to excite oscillations {{in the domain of}} interest. To perform the analysis we have constructed a series of time–distance diagrams of the vertical and perpendicular components of the velocity with respect to the magnetic field lines at each height of the computational domain. These time–distance diagrams are subject to spatio-temporal Fourier transforms allowing us to build ω–k dispersion diagrams for all of the simulated regions in the solar atmosphere. This approach makes it possible to compute the phase speeds of waves propagating throughout the various regions of the solar atmosphere model.

40|$|A set of co-aligned high {{resolution}} {{images from the}} Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is used to investigate propagating disturbances (PDs) in warm fan loops at the periphery of a non-flaring active region NOAA AR 11082. To measure PD speeds at multiple coronal temperatures, a new data analysis methodology is proposed enabling quantitative description of subvisual coronal motions with low signal-to-noise ratios {{of the order of}} 0. 1 %. The technique operates with a set of one-dimensional "surfing" signals extracted from position-time plots of several AIA channels through a modified version of Radon transform. The signals are used to evaluate a two-dimensional power spectral density distribution in the frequency - velocity space which exhibits a resonance in the presence of quasi-periodic PDs. By applying this analysis to the same fan loop structures observed in several AIA channels, we found that the traveling velocity of PDs increases with the temperature of the coronal plasma following the square root dependence predicted for the slow <b>mode</b> <b>magneto-acoustic</b> wave which seems to be the dominating wave mode in the studied loop structures. This result extends recent observations by Kiddie et al. (Solar Phys., 2012) to a more general class of fan loop systems not associated with sunspots and demonstrating consistent slow mode activity in up to four AIA channels.

40|$|Parsec-scale VLBA {{images of}} BL Lac at 15 GHz {{show that the}} jet {{contains}} a permanent quasi-stationary emission feature 0. 26 mas (0. 34 pc projected) from the core, along with numerous moving features. In projection, the tracks of the moving features cluster around an axis at a position angle of – 166 º. 6 that connects the core with the standing feature. The moving features appear to emanate from the standing feature in a manner strikingly similar {{to the results of}} numerical two-dimensional relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations in which moving shocks are generated at a recollimation shock (RCS). Because of this, and the close analogy to the jet feature HST- 1 in M 87, we identify the standing feature in BL Lac as an RCS. We assume that the magnetic field dominates the dynamics in the jet, and that the field is predominantly toroidal. From this we suggest that the moving features are compressions established by slow and fast <b>mode</b> <b>magneto-acoustic</b> MHD waves. We illustrate the situation with a simple model in which the slowest moving feature is a slow-mode wave, and the fastest feature is a fast-mode wave. In the model, the beam has Lorentz factor Γ_(beam) ^(gal) ≈ 3. 5 in the frame of the host galaxy and the fast mode wave has Lorentz factor Γ_(Fwave) ^(beam) ≈ 1. 6 in the frame of the beam. This gives a maximum apparent speed for the moving features, β_(app) = v_(app) /c = 10.
