40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of land use/cover change (LULCC) {{is important}} for efficient environmental management, especially in regions that are extremely affected by climate variability and continuous population growth such as West Africa. In this context, accurate LULC classification and statistically sound change area estimates are essential for {{a better understanding of}} LULCC processes. This study aimed at comparing mono-temporal and multi-temporal LULC classifications as well as their combination with ancillary data and to determine LULCC across the heterogeneous landscape of southwest Burkina Faso using accurate classification results. Landsat data (1999, 2006 and 2011) and ancillary data served as input features for the random forest classifier algorithm. Five LULC classes were identified: woodland, mixed vegetation, bare surface, water and agricultural area. A reference database was established using different sources including high-resolution images, aerial photo and field data. LULCC and LULC classification accuracies, area and area uncertainty were computed based on the method of adjusted error matrices. The results revealed that <b>multi-temporal</b> <b>classification</b> significantly outperformed those solely based on mono-temporal data in the study area. However, combining mono-temporal imagery and ancillary data for LULC classification had the same accuracy level as <b>multi-temporal</b> <b>classification</b> which is an indication that this combination is an efficient alternative to <b>multi-temporal</b> <b>classification</b> in the study region, where cloud free images are rare. The LULCC map obtained had an overall accuracy of 92 %. Natural vegetation loss was estimated to be 17. 9 % ± 2. 5 % between 1999 and 2011. The study area experienced an increase in agricultural area and bare surface at the expense of woodland and mixed vegetation, which attests to the ongoing deforestation. These results can serve as means of regional and global land cover products validation, as they provide a new validated data set with uncertainty estimates in heterogeneous ecosystems prone to classification errors...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the past}} years {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out on the usefulness of ENVISAT ASAR dual polarimetric data for environmental mapping of agricultural areas. The performance of such approach is limited by the spatial resolution of the data, which is firstly too coarse for sufficient sampling of small fields often found in Europe and secondly useful features related to agricultural treatments (irrigation, fertilization, soil and plant treatment) are blurred. However, it was shown that proper selection of images out of a time series according to the crop-calendar of that region is beneficial and gives in general more accurate results than using all of the images. This {{is due to the fact}} that some fields are covered by different types of crops during the year and such sequence is often hard to model because the decisions of individual farmers are governed by a variety of phenological, ecologic, and economic constraints. The latter might be influenced either from sudden change of global or national economic conditions (e. g., oil prize, taxes, and subsidies), the farmer’s personal entrepreneurial strategies, or both. In this paper, results obtained from <b>multi-temporal</b> <b>classifications</b> of TerraSAR-X image pairs (HH and VV) covering a whole season are presented.

Remote sensing {{is a useful}} technique for providing accurate and reliable information for land use planning and to support large scale grassland management. In the context of “GIO land” (Copernicus initial operations land), which is currently implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA), the permanent grasslands of 39 countries in Europe has to be mapped with an overall classification accuracy of more than 80 %. Since grassland canopy density, chlorophyll status and ground cover is highly dynamic throughout the growing season, no unique spectral signature {{can be used to}} map grasslands.

Object-oriented post-classification comparison and fragmentation analyses were performed; and the Landscape-Function {{analysis was used to}} assess the current rangeland condition of proximal hillslopes and the riparian zone. Temporal land use/cover analyses revealed that intact vegetation has undergone a significant decline from 1972 to 2006. Increases in degraded vegetation and fragmentation, as well as in bare eroded soil, were identified- particularly in the communal villages of the central Keiskamma catchment. The Landscape Organisation Index revealed very low vegetation connectivity in the communal rangelands that have weak local traditional institutions. Fragmentation analyses on the riparian and proximal hillslopes revealed evidence of increasing vegetation fragmentation from 1972 to 2006. Given the worsening degradation {{trends in the}} communal areas, a systematic re-allocation of state land in sections of the catchment is recommended. Strengthening local institutions that effectively manage vegetation resources will be required, in order to maintain optimum flow regimes in rivers and curb thicket degradation.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the added value of quad-pol data in a <b>multi-temporal</b> crop <b>classification</b> framework based on SAR imagery. With this aim, three RADARSAT- 2 scenes were acquired between May and June 2010. Once we analyzed the separability and the descriptive analysis of the features, an object-based supervised classification was performed using the Random Forests classification algorithm. Classification results obtained with dual-pol (VV-VH) data as input were compared to those using quad-pol data in different polarization bases (linear H-V, circular, and linear 45 °), and also to configurations where several polarimetric features (Pauli and Cloude–Pottier decomposition features and co-pol coherence and phase difference) were added. Dual-pol data obtained satisfactory results, equal to those obtained with quad-pol data (in H-V basis) in terms of overall accuracy (0. 79) and Kappa values (0. 69). Quad-pol data in circular and linear 45 ° bases resulted in lower accuracies. The inclusion of polarimetric features, particularly co-pol coherence and phase difference, resulted in enhanced classification accuracies with an overall accuracy of 0. 86 and Kappa of 0. 79 in the best case, when all the polarimetric features were added. Improvements were also observed in the identification of some particular crops, but major crops like cereals, rapeseed, and sunflower already achieved a satisfactory accuracy with the VV-VH dual-pol configuration and obtained only minor improvements. Therefore, it can be concluded that C-band VV-VH dual-pol data is almost ready to be used operationally for crop mapping as long as at least three acquisitions in dates reflecting key growth stages representing typical phenology differences of the present crops are available. In the near future, issues regarding the classification of crops with small field sizes and heterogeneous cover (i. e., fallow and grasslands) need to be tackled to make this application fully operational...|$|R

Validation of the Borneo map is still ongoing using large ground data sets and other reference sets spread over Borneo. It is pursued to develop legends in compliance with LCCS and IPCC guidelines. These results may be of key interest to develop REDD projects for the humid tropics. Maps created for the Central Kalimantan prototype area indicate good results for LULC mapping, flood frequency mapping and peat swamp hydrology may be obtained. These maps are already used by local organisations...|$|E

Computers & Geosciences, 57, 24 - 31. In this paper the combined {{use of the}} regularized kernel Fisher's discriminant analysis classifier (kFDA) with Landsat TM multispectral imagery is explored for flooded area cartography purposes. This classifier provides an efficient and regularized solution for the non-linear delineation of pixels corresponding to flooded surface. The flood mapping issue is tackled from both uni- and <b>multi-temporal</b> <b>classification</b> perspectives: the former recasts the problem as a classical image classification procedure ? with class water as target; the latter considers the extraction of flooded area as a change detection problem ? in which only the non-permanent standing water is considered as flood. As a case study is used a Landsat TM dataset of the James River in South Dakota (USA), a region that experienced a heterogeneous flooding in spring 2011. Findings from our analysis suggest that precisely delineating the exceeding water extent requires a non-linear classifier applied in a multi-temporal setting. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} poppy and other annual crops vary considerably throughout their growth and development. Until {{the publication of}} this research the spectral signature of poppy and its contrast with neighbouring crops in Afghanistan was undefined. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} application of remote sensing to discriminate poppy from other cover types using spectral signatures obtained from the analysis of multi-spectral imagery. The consistency of discrimination through time for different geographical regions was of particular interest. A review of previous poppy studies identified weaknesses with existing methods used to monitor poppy and provide reference data to validate resulting maps. Weaknesses were in the main due to the limited availability of quantifiable knowledge on the spectral-temporal properties of cover types and the lack of accuracy measures necessary to validate poppy identification. To overcome the lack of quantitative knowledge this research characterises the spatial and temporal variability of poppy spectral response patterns. A methodology was developed to acquire multi-temporal IKONOS images, aerial photographs and ground data covering two growth cycles across a range of sites in Afghanistan. Optimum techniques were developed to facilitate the collection of training pixels for each cover type to satisfy the assumptions of the supervised Maximum Likelihood classification (MLC). Spectral signatures of cover types were examined using the Jeffries Matusita distance measure to identify signature separability and predict classification accuracy. The accuracy of each MLC was assessed using error matrices, Kappa statistics and regression. Results confirm that sufficient spectral contrast exists between poppy and other crops during poppy flowering which enables accurate discrimination. A relationship was found between overall spectral separability and classification accuracy, showing separability can be used to predict classification accuracy at flowering. At other times insufficient differences exist between the spectral reflectance of other crops and poppy. <b>Multi-temporal</b> image <b>classifications</b> achieved greater accuracy than their corresponding single date classifications in the majority of cases studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of the free U. S. Landsat data policy it is now {{feasible}} to consider the generation of global coverage 30 m Landsat data sets with temporal reporting frequency similar to that provided by the monthly Web Enabled Landsat (WELD) products. A statistical Landsat metadata analysis is reported considering more than 800, 000 Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ acquisitions obtained from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center archive. The global monthly probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation for December 1998 to November 2001 (2000 epoch) and from December 2008 to November 2011 (2010 epoch) are reported to assess the availability of the Landsat data in the USGS Landsat archive for global multi-temporal land remote sensing applications. The global probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation in each of three different seasons with the highest seasonal probabilities of cloud-free land surface observation are reported, considering one, two and three years of Landsat data, to assess the availability of Landsat data for global land cover mapping. The probabilities are derived considering Landsat 5 TM only, Landsat 7 ETM+ only, and both sensors combined, to examine the relative benefits of using one or both Landsat sensors. The results demonstrate the utility of combing both Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ data streams to take advantage of their different acquisition patterns and to mitigate the deleterious impact of the Landsat 7 ETM+ 2003 scan line failure. Sensor combination provided a greater global acquisition coverage with a 1. 7 % to 14. 4 % higher percentage of land locations acquired monthly compared to considering Landsat 7 ETM+ data alone. The mean global monthly probability of a cloud-free land surface observation for the combined sensors was up to nearly 1. 4 and 6. 7 times greater than for ETM+ and TM alone respectively. The probability of acquiring a cloud-free Landsat land surface observation in different seasons was greater when more years of data were considered and when both Landsat sensor data were combined. Considering combined sensors and 36 months of data, 86. 4 % and 84. 2 % of the global land locations had probabilities ≥ 0. 95 for the 2000 and 2010 epochs respectively, with a global mean probability of 0. 92 (σ 0. 24) for the 2000 epoch and 0. 90 (σ 0. 28) for the 2010 epoch. These results indicate that 36 months of combined Landsat sensor data will provide sufficient land surface observations for 30 m global land cover mapping using a <b>multi-temporal</b> supervised <b>classification</b> scheme...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 's {{remote sensing}} enable {{constant}} monitoring of land cover and land use, which are considered {{as the most}} crucial environmental data. Obtaining this information at global, regional and local scales, became the goal of many research and application programs and has allowed for the {{deeper understanding of the}} entire Earth system. In December 1999 NASA launched the EOS Terra Satellite, followed in 2002 by Aqua, both equipped with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Thanks to its technical specification and free distribution of the majority of its products, MODIS is considered {{to be the most important}} sensor for the global vegetation mapping. Although has been originally designed for large-scale analysis, MODIS is also used in many regional research programs. This paper presents results of two approaches of <b>multi-temporal</b> land cover <b>classification</b> of MODIS data. For the study polygon of 22100 square kilometres, situated in the western Poland, four single day surface reflectance data sets, of spatial resolution of 250 m and 500 m, were collected for the year 2007 - one for spring and autumn, and two for summer. In the first approach supervised land cover classification was conducted for each set of single day data separately. On the basis of obtained results, final classification was elaborated as an effect of analyse of the sequence of changes for each pixel. In second approach, independent classification was conducted for the aggregation of all possessed data. The accuracy of all classifications' results was checked against Corine Land Cover 2000 database using 4200 randomly distributed points. Obtained statistics show that comparing with single-day classifications as well as with classification of aggregated data, multi temporal approach based on the analysis of sequence, enabled crucial improvement of accuracy of the classification.
