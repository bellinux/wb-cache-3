5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious actors sued the <b>management</b> <b>at</b> the King's Bench over the management's {{occupation}} of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November.

This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734.
