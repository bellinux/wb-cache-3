25|$|A small Monolith appears before Heywood Floyd in 2061 {{on board}} the Galaxy spacecraft. He nicknames it <b>Minilith</b> for its small size {{compared}} to other observed Monoliths. At {{the end of the}} book it is explained that Halman used the <b>Minilith</b> to replicate Heywood Floyd's consciousness to help him uncover the Monolith's operations.|$|E
50|$|Floyd and Chris become close again, {{and both}} become friends with van der Berg. They {{talk about how}} Floyd called Bowman on the radio, and Chris asks if Bowman ever replied.

50|$|Universe {{is forced}} to abandon its {{exploration}} of Halley to rescue Galaxy. After siphoning water from Halley's vents to refuel, an idea conceived by Universe&apos;s navigation officer and advanced by Floyd, Universe heads directly for Europa without returning to Earth first. During the flight to Europa, the celebrity guests discuss the mystery surrounding Dave Bowman and the monoliths, and whether they {{would be allowed to}} land on Europa to rescue Galaxy&apos;s crew. Floyd follows a suggestion that he simply try to call Bowman on the radio, and that night has a strange dream in which he sees a small monolith (referred to as a <b>minilith)</b> floating at the foot of his bed.|$|E
40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} to a previously neglected element of the broad repertoire of monumental megalithic structures that characterise the later 3 rd and 2 nd millennia BC across the British Isles – extremely small standing stones. Despite their frequency and the complex arrangements and associations they embody, these <b>miniliths</b> are rarely recorded in detail and frequently marginalised to a generic background. As a result they are largely absent from interpretative accounts. Drawing upon recent debates regarding materiality and monument form, alongside the results of excavations explicitly targeting tiny stone settings, the discussion argues that the phenomenon of raising and fixing small uprights was not only widespread and persistent, but sheds important light upon the beliefs and ideas driving monument construction during the later Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{exclusive}} use of extremely small megaliths (<b>miniliths)</b> the prehistoric stone settings of Exmoor, SW England, challenge current approaches to the interpretation of monumental stone architecture during the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age. Whilst the broader context of the practice of erecting tiny upright stones (a seemingly diverse and widespread phenomenon) and the reasons why this diminutive architecture has tended to escape sustained critical comment have been explored (smaller stone elements being relegated to a generalised background or subsidiary role such as ‘packing’), attempts to explain the settings have been remarkably few. Drawing upon the results of ten years of piecemeal fieldwork on the moor the present paper seeks to rectify this, arguing that far from generalised ritual structures or metaphorical expressions of hunting groups, the tiny stones were instead an integral part of a dynamic human-animal landscape of movement and pause.

The unabridged version can be consulted, on request, at the University of Leicester Library. This thesis characterizes and interprets the nature of Exmoor’s late 3 rd and early 2 nd millennium BC landscapes, including an unusual array of ‘minilithic’ stone configurations. It develops a new theoretical framework using an ontology of assemblages, the concept of affectivity and perspectives on miniaturisation and scale, adopting a Deleuzian understanding of materiality. This promotes an exploration of the processes which led to the appearance, use and dispersal of archaeological entities as assemblages. It includes all forms of people’s interactions with materials, monuments, material culture (lithics) and landscapes; questioning the value of classificatory approaches and studying such themes as monumentality in isolation. The first detailed study of the lithic collections explores how the ontological significance of stone developed over millennia, leading to the emergence of upright stone configurations in the landscape. A detailed synthesis of the available archaeological evidence from excavation, survey, HER and museum datasets is then presented focusing on three case study zones, with entirely new interpretations developed for key sites at multiple scales. It then goes on to explore their wider relationships in terms of chronology, spatial placement, archaeological and landscape context. This is achieved through GIS analysis, original fieldwork (field visits, surveys, geophysics and excavation) and the synthesis and re-interpretation of secondary and archive data. The wider context of Exmoor is then briefly assessed, particularly drawing on evidence from Bodmin Moor. Tendencies to dismiss Exmoor as a poorer relation of such regions is challenged. Exmoor’s monuments challenge thinking on monumentality, particularly regarding the establishment of authority, through the choreography of space, movement and visibility. The <b>miniliths</b> had distinct affective qualities, with a unique capacity for frequent reconfiguration, quite different from megalithic sites elsewhere; yet many of the same practices are apparent. On Exmoor however, what people were doing with these practices was wholly different...|$|R
50|$|In a later chapter, another Heywood Floyd, now a disembodied {{creature}} of pure consciousness, talks with Dave Bowman. It is {{revealed that the}} <b>minilith</b> duplicated Floyd's consciousness; there are now two Heywood Floyds, one an immortal being who resides with Bowman and HAL inside the Great Wall, another who will live and die without knowing this. Bowman shows Floyd images of his experience of studying the life forms of Jupiter before they {{were killed in the}} creation of Lucifer, explaining that the monolith weighed the Jovians against the Europans and decided the latter held more promise. Bowman states that during the diamond meteor impact, the immensely powerful monolith tipped over on it's side, and may be damaged, And that he and HAL believe that when Lucifer begins to fail, the monolith will weigh the Europans against humanity, and they have only about a thousand years to prepare for that moment.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{check the}} {{efficiency}} of shock waves {{in the treatment of}} induratio penis plastica. The <b>Minilith</b> SL 1, successfully used in orthopedic or salivary stones because of its lithotriptic power, can be used to break plaques in Peyronie's disease. Methods: A total of 130 patients affected with Peyronie's disease were entered into a prospective trial. Patients with completely calcified plaques as determined by ultrasound evaluation were excluded. We divided the patients into three treatment groups: (A) shock waves alone in 21 patients; (B) a combination of shock waves and verapamil (perilesional injection) in 36 patients, and (C) verapamil alone in 73 patients. First, we treated all groups A and B patients 3 times, 20 min each time, with a <b>Minilith</b> SL 1, and then only the patients of the second group received a complete cycle of twelve injections of verapamil (10 mg) every 2 weeks for 6 months. The group of 73 patients (group C) treated during the previous 2 years with a medical therapy (only injection of verapamil) was used as a control group. Results: Ultrasound evaluation showed a reduction of plaque in 11 / 21 group A patients and 7 / 36 group B patients. The treatment was tolerated very well and only 11 petechiae in some patients were noticed after ESW treatment. Conclusions: The therapeutic association of shock waves with verapamil injection is an effective nonoperative treatment for the stabilization of Peyronie's disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of extra corporeal shock waves (ESW) therapy on the metabolism of healthy and osteoarthritic human chondrocytes, and particularly on the expression of IL- 10, TNF-alpha and beta 1 integrin. METHODS: Human adult articular cartilage was obtained from 9 patients (6 male and 3 females), with primary knee osteoarthritis (OA), undergoing total joint replacement and from 3 young healthy donors (HD) (2 males, 1 female) with joint traumatic fracture. After isolation, chondrocytes underwent ESW treatment (electromagnetic generator system, <b>MINILITH</b> SL 1, STORZ MEDICAL) at different parameters of impulses, energy levels and energy flux density. After that, chondrocytes were cultured in 24 -well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study {{was to assess the}} efficacy of shockwave (SW) therapy in the management of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In this study, 30 patients (pts) who were affected by CRPS of the medial femoral condyle and unresponsive to previous standard physiotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment underwent 3 SW sessions at 72 -h intervals, each consisting of 4000 shocks emitted by a <b>MiniLith</b> SL 1 Storz electromagnetic generator. An energy flux density (EFD) of 0. 035 or 0. 09 mJ/mm 2 was used, depending on how well the patient endured the pain during the treatment. Satisfactory results were observed in 76. 7 % of the cases (23 pts) at the 2 -month follow-up (FU) visit, and in 80 % (24 pts) at the 6 -month FU visit. The therapeutic effects of SW were caused by decreasing pain. The significant improvements we obtained bear witness to the potential value of SW therapy in the management of CRPS.

Methods Human adult articular cartilage was obtained from 9 patients (6 male and 3 females), with primary knee osteoarthritis (OA), undergoing total joint replacement and from 3 young healthy donors (HD) (2 males, 1 female) with joint traumatic fracture. After isolation, chondrocytes underwent ESW treatment (electromagnetic generator system, <b>MINILITH</b> SL 1, STORZ MEDICAL) at different parameters of impulses, energy levels and energy flux density. After that, chondrocytes were cultured in 24 -well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS for 48 hours and then beta 1 integrin surface expression and intracellular IL- 10 and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated by flow-cytometry. Results At baseline, osteoarthritic chondrocytes expressed significantly lower levels of beta 1 integrin and higher levels and IL- 10 and TNF-alpha levels. Following ESW application, while beta 1 integrin expression remain unchanged, a significant decrease of IL- 10 and TNF-alpha intracellular levels was observed both in osteoarthritic and healthy chondrocytes. IL- 10 levels decreased at any impulses and energy levels, while a significant reduction of TNF-alpha was mainly found at middle energies. Conclusion Our study confirmed that osteoarthritic chondrocytes express low beta 1 integrin and high TNF-alpha and IL- 10 levels. Nonetheless, ESW treatment application down-regulate the intracellular levels of TNF-alpha and IL- 10 by chondrocytes, suggesting that ESW might restore TNF-alpha and IL- 10 production by osteoarthritic chondrocytes at normal levels. However, further in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to establish if ESW can represent a viable option in the treatment of OA. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the predictive value of sonographic fragmentation in the successful treatment of sialolithiasis. The main {{objective was to}} streamline the management by treating the patients with three sessions of ultrasonic lithotripsy, and to compare the success rate and complications with data from the literature. A second objective was to analyse the predictive value of data from the post procedure and follow-up sonography related to therapeutic success with regard to size, site and location of stones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up of 25 patients (mean age of 43 ± 17. 2 years old 11 - 68; 13 women, 10 men) {{over a period of}} 31 months (October 2009 -April 2012) with one or more salivary calculi (19 parotid, submandibular 6) treated with extracorporeal lithotripsy (electromagnetic <b>MINILITH</b> SL 1, Storz Medical, Switzerland). No anaesthesia or analgesia was used. Each session of lithotripsy lasted on average 30 min. Minor complications were collected on an anonymised sheet. RESULTS: Complete success (absence of clinical symptoms 3 months after the end of treatment (or the last session) and residual stones 2 mm) in 48 % and failure (persistence of same or increased symptoms at 3 months or no change in size of the calculi) in 17 % of patients. Sonographic fragmentation of the stone (p = 0. 004), total energy delivered (p = 0. 008) and the total number of shock waves (n = 0. 045) are predictive factors of complete success. Size, salivary topography, ductal topography, mobilization of the stones, occurrence of minor side effects and total duration of treatment had no predictive value of complete success (p > 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the first 5 and the last 20 patients (p = 0. 367). In agreement with the literature data, the efficacy of treatment was greater for parotid than submandibular calculi. CONCLUSION: Extracorporeal lithotripsy is an alternative to conventional surgery with no major complications. Sonographic fragmentation of calculi, total energy and total number of shock waves are predictive factors of successful treatment...|$|E
