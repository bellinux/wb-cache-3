5|$|A comic {{figure of}} an {{intelligent}} <b>Martian,</b> Marvin the <b>Martian,</b> appeared {{on television in}} 1948 as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow <b>Martian</b> soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the <b>Martian</b> surface.|$|E
50|$|The Red <b>Martians</b> are hybrids of {{the ancient}} Yellow <b>Martians,</b> White <b>Martians,</b> and Black <b>Martians,</b> who joined forces when the seas of Barsoom began to dry up; their union created a hardy race capable of {{surviving}} in a dying world.|$|R
50|$|Instant <b>Martians</b> - <b>Martians</b> {{who start}} out as pills will turn into <b>martians</b> when water is added. They appear as {{obstacles}} in Dimension X.|$|R
50|$|The Red <b>Martians</b> are the {{dominant}} culture on Barsoom. They are organized into a system of imperial city-states including Helium, Ptarth, and Zodanga, controlling the planetary canal system, {{as well as other}} more-isolated city-states in the hinterlands. The Red <b>Martians</b> are the interbred descendants of the ancient Yellow <b>Martians,</b> White <b>Martians</b> and Black <b>Martians,</b> remnants of which exist in isolated areas of the planet, particularly the poles. The Red <b>Martians</b> are said in A Princess of Mars to have been bred when the seas of Barsoom began to dry up, in hopes of creating a hardy race to survive in the new environment.|$|R
5|$|Influential works {{included}} Ray Bradbury's The <b>Martian</b> Chronicles, {{in which}} human explorers accidentally destroy a <b>Martian</b> civilization, Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, C. S. Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet (1938), {{and a number of}} Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.|$|E

5|$|<b>Martian</b> craters {{can have}} a {{morphology}} that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Martians</b> are humans {{from the}} planet Mars. [...] "Mars" [...] refers to both the planet and the group mind of all living <b>Martians.</b> <b>Martians</b> are still {{individuals}}, though individuals can have the group mind act through them (whereupon their eyes turn black) to communicate messages. <b>Martians</b> tend to be informal, preferring to use first names in conversation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Martians</b> use {{the same}} {{terminology}} for different generations as Japanese Americans. People who immigrated from Earth are called issei, the first generation born on Mars are nisei, and the second-generation <b>Martians</b> are sansei. Third-generation <b>Martians</b> are called yonsai.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Martians</b> later {{appeared}} in 2015 in All-New Invaders #11-15. The story was collected {{under the title}} [...] "The <b>Martians</b> are Coming".|$|R

5|$|The International Planetary Patrol Program {{was formed}} in 1969 as a {{consortium}} to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars. Their images allow <b>Martian</b> seasonal patterns to be studied globally, and they showed that most <b>Martian</b> dust storms occur when the planet is closest to the Sun.|$|E
50|$|The first book, A Princess of Mars, {{introduced}} the tall, gangly, four-armed, orc-like Green <b>Martians</b> {{and the more}} common humanoid Red <b>Martians.</b> John Carter spent his first ten years on Mars without knowing {{of the existence of}} the other races, aside from ancient paintings and frescoes that depicted White <b>Martians.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While the Green <b>Martians</b> were {{peaceful}} philosophers, the White <b>Martians</b> were savage warriors. A lengthy {{civil war}} between the two races ended when the few surviving White <b>Martians</b> were rounded up and exiled to the extra-dimensional [...] "Still Zone" [...] (apparently distinct from Superman's Phantom Zone, {{in which they were}} later imprisoned again).|$|R
5000|$|Martians: Primitive but {{intelligent}} humanoids {{who lived}} beneath the sands. <b>Martians</b> {{burst into flames}} when brought in contact with water. <b>Martians</b> killed many of the early human explorers on Mars, principally because they concealed their existence, and they weren't suspected. In the novel Protector, the <b>Martians</b> were wiped out when Jack Brennan caused an ice asteroid to crash into the surface of Mars, raising the average humidity of the atmosphere. Some <b>Martians</b> still exist on the [...] "Map of Mars" [...] on the Ringworld.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Martian</b> {{was listed}} on many critics' top ten lists.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix lander {{returned}} data showing <b>Martian</b> soil to {{be slightly}} alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the lander showed that the <b>Martian</b> soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Barack Obama named The <b>Martian</b> {{as among}} the best science fiction films he had ever seen.|$|E

50|$|The Jet Age of Tomorrow (or The Super 3) is an American {{production}} duo from Los Angeles, California {{that consists}} of producer-singer Matt <b>Martians,</b> and producer-rapper Pyramid Vritra. According to <b>Martians,</b> the group's music originated from instrumentals turned down by Tyler, The Creator and Hodgy Beats, who liked the tracks <b>Martians</b> sent them, but could not use them in their own music.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Day the <b>Martians</b> Came" [...] {{is a short}} {{piece about}} men in a bar making up jokes about the newly {{discovered}} <b>Martians,</b> who are pathetic primitive beings. All are re-workings of old racial jokes. Somebody suggests that discovering the <b>Martians</b> won't matter to anybody, but the black bartender responds that it might matter a lot to people like him.|$|R
5|$|During the {{company-wide}} crossover Infinite Crisis (2005), Oracle {{teams with}} the <b>Martian</b> Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also {{cut short by}} the Infinite Crisis storyline.|$|E
5|$|Even in the 1960s {{articles}} were published on <b>Martian</b> biology, putting aside explanations other than {{life for the}} seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published.|$|E
5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The <b>Martian</b> with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology was being used in more immersive storytelling, citing The <b>Martian</b> and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples.|$|E
50|$|As {{a race of}} shapeshifters, {{physical}} appearance has little meaning for <b>Martians.</b> The underlying psychological differences are what separated the peaceful Green <b>Martians</b> from the war-like Whites. White <b>Martians</b> have configured their physiology to reflect their philosophy, becoming a separate race from the Green and Yellow <b>Martians.</b> In the current DC continuity, their preferred form is that of angular, hairless humanoids with chalky white skin which often forms bony ridges or plates, giving them the appearance of armor. They have sometimes been seen to have a gaping mouth on their thorax and a horn {{on the same level}} on each side.|$|R
50|$|The Handling {{machine is}} one of the fictional {{machines}} used by the <b>Martians</b> in H. G. Wells' science fiction novel The War of the Worlds. It is a crawling device used by the <b>Martians</b> to lift and manipulate other objects. It {{is one of}} the four types of heavy machine the <b>Martians</b> bring with them when they invade Earth, along with the fighting machine, the flying machine, and the embankment machine.|$|R
50|$|Pečjak {{is perhaps}} best known for his SF novel for {{children}} and youth Drejček in trije marsovčki (Drejček and Three Little <b>Martians)</b> (1961), which concerns a little boy named Drejček (Andy) who meets three little <b>Martians.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, {{which had the}} benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, The <b>Martian</b> was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The <b>Martian</b> played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The <b>Martian</b> did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Richie and Florence {{are awarded}} the Medal of Honor by Taffy, she {{being the only}} {{surviving}} member of the government. Byron, who survived his brawl with the Martians, arrives in D.C. to reunite with his former wife Louise and their two sons Cedric and Neville (who saved Dale's life back in the White House using two guns they stole from a dead <b>Martian)</b> as the devastation is being cleaned up. Barbara, Cindy and Tom Jones emerge from a cave with some animals to see dozens of crashed <b>Martian</b> ships in the adjacent Lake Tahoe.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern <b>Martian</b> atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of <b>Martian</b> deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that <b>Martian</b> climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E
50|$|The series {{take place}} in the future, after mankind {{migrated}} to the planet Mars, home to the <b>Martians.</b> Before long, the humans begin persecuting the <b>Martians,</b> and the two species form a mutual hatred of each other.|$|R
50|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the <b>Martians</b> invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House, the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the <b>Martians</b> expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} the Earth, defacing world landmarks for amusement as they do so. That night, the <b>Martians</b> breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The <b>Martians</b> kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The <b>Martians</b> seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|R
50|$|M'gann M'orzz was {{originally}} sent by rocket from Mars to the Vega system, {{to escape the}} civil war between the Green <b>Martians</b> and the White <b>Martians.</b> To date, it is still unknown {{when she came to}} Earth from Vega.|$|R
