5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large clams and one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they <b>move</b> <b>like</b> inchworms.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they <b>move.</b> <b>Like</b> EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to <b>move</b> <b>like</b> a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae <b>move</b> <b>like</b> amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E

25|$|Giving {{the queen}} the knight's move: Similarly to the above, the odds-receiver's queen (rather than king) has the {{additional}} ability to <b>move</b> <b>like</b> a knight. This makes the queen very powerful, since {{she has the}} ability to administer mate without the assistance of any other pieces (for instance, an enhanced queen on h6 mates a king on h8, since Kg8 would still leave the king in check). Carrera considered this roughly equivalent to knight odds, although it varied depending on the players' strengths.|$|E
25|$|As {{inanimate objects}} cover the classes II, III and IV, it's not {{transparent}} into which class an inanimate object belongs. However, {{there are certain}} tendencies based on the semantic field of the nouns. Nouns {{that are able to}} <b>move</b> (<b>like</b> sun, moon, star, lightning, car, train) usually belong to class III, while products that traditionally {{have to do with the}} work of women (like clothes or berries and also milk) often belong to class II. Clothes made from leather are—as the word for leather itself—usually assigned to class III, due to their relation to animals.|$|E
25|$|About Wushu, Li {{said that}} he {{believes}} the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony, and considers it a sad development that today's Wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist. He believes Wushu now lacks individuality and competitors <b>move</b> <b>like</b> machines, whereas according to his views Wushu {{should not be considered}} a race where the fastest athlete wins. He would like to see Wushu as a form of art, where artists have a distinctive style. Li blames the new competition rules that, according to him, place limitations on martial artists.|$|E

25|$|In June 2013, Oracle changed Berkeley DB's license {{from the}} Sleepycat license to the Affero General Public License, thus restricting {{its use in}} a wide variety of applications. This caused the Debian project to exclude the library from 6.0 onwards. It was also criticized that this license is not {{friendly}} to commercial redistributors. The discussion was sparked over whether the same licensing change could happen to LMDB. Author Howard Chu made clear that LMDB is part of the OpenLDAP project, which had its BSD style license before he joined, and it will stay like it. No copyright is transferred to anybody by checking in, which would make a similar <b>move</b> <b>like</b> Oracle's impossible.|$|E
25|$|Giving {{the king}} the knight's move: The odds-receiver's king, in {{addition}} to being able to move in the usual manner, is able to <b>move</b> <b>like</b> a knight. Carrera considered this form of odds improper because it allows the odds-receiver to use his king to checkmate the enemy king from a knight's move away (for example, with the odds-receiver's king at g6 and the odds-giver's king at h8, the latter is in check and, if no legal response is possible, is checkmated). Carrera considered this form of odds equivalent to giving rook and pawn odds. Because of the king's unusual power, the odds-giver requires more material than usual in order to checkmate a bare king (for example, queen and another piece, or two rooks).|$|E
25|$|Lee, who {{was already}} {{concerned}} {{about the ability of}} his weakening army to maintain the defense of Petersburg and Richmond, realized that the defeat at Fort Stedman would encourage Grant to make a <b>move</b> <b>like</b> the one he was planning. Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to the western end of his line, and a mobile force beyond {{the end of the line}} to protect the junction at Five Forks, on the morning of March 29 when the Union infantry under Warren and Humphreys and the cavalry under Sheridan began their southwestward movements. Later that day Confederate forces under Major General Bushrod Johnson engaged Brevet Major General Charles Griffin's First Division of the V Corps at the Battle of Lewis's Farm.|$|E

500|$|According to Billboard, {{the album}} was {{recorded}} in engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. Additional recording sessions were held in Los Angeles. The title of the album comes from {{a line in the}} song [...] "Too Late"; one of the working titles for {{the album was}} Sharp Subtle Flavor. Ocasek decided to title the album <b>Move</b> <b>Like</b> This as a reference to the band's reputation for not moving around very much onstage.|$|E

500|$|<b>Move</b> <b>Like</b> This was {{released}} on May 10, 2011, and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The album received generally positive reviews from critics: in a three-and-a-half star review, Rolling Stone praised the [...] "skillful restraint" [...] of the band and Lee's production work, describing the album as [...] "taut, sleek, seamless, [...] efficient". The A.V. Club awarded the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, praising the [...] "catchy" [...] "Blue Tip" [...] and [...] "Sad Song", and noting the latter song's similarity to [...] "My Best Friend's Girl" [...] from the band's 1978 debut. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album {{four out of five}} stars, describing the album as [...] "as bright, infectious, and tuneful as the Cars at their prime." [...] Spin, however, granted the album a 5 out of 10 rating, criticizing the [...] "clunkiness" [...] of Ocasek's lyrics. NPR's Elizabeth Nelson called <b>Move</b> <b>Like</b> This a [...] "fine new album" [...] and singled out [...] "Blue Tip" [...] as [...] "an incandescent pop gem" [...] with a [...] "brilliant" [...] musical structure and [...] "an absolutely relentless sing-along chorus".|$|E
