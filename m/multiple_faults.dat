40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare different neural network based classifiers for the accurate and reliable assessment of the status of specific fault conditions in a system with <b>multiple</b> <b>fault</b> conditions present. The proposed strategy utilizes features extracted from vibrational data and employs selforganising maps (SOMs), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks to model the status of fault conditions, and to discriminate between different fault conditions. Different combinations of vibrational features are evaluated in terms of their ability to support the reliable identification of and discrimination between <b>multiple</b> <b>fault</b> conditions. The results indicate that both SOM and RBF neural classifiers can be trained to reliably identify specific faults in a system with <b>multiple</b> <b>fault</b> conditions present. It is furthermore shown that neural classifiers trained with data reflecting one type of fault mechanism only cannot reliably distinguish between observations with <b>multiple</b> <b>fault</b> conditions present.

This assumption may result to erroneous diagnosis statement in case where <b>multiple</b> <b>faults</b> occurs. Thus multiple fault diagnosis is a challenging field particularly in the control of large scale complex systems that {{can be viewed as}} hybrid systems. The main reason is that <b>multiple</b> <b>faults</b> are hard to detect because their consequences can mask or compensate to each other. The goal is to detect <b>multiple</b> <b>faults</b> as early as possible and provide a timely warning. A key issue is to prevent local faults to be developed into system failures that may cause safety hazards, stop temporarily the production and possible detrimental environment impact. In this paper we discuss the notion of <b>multiple</b> <b>faults</b> diagnosability of Hybrid Systems in the framework of Hybrid Input Output Automata (HIOA).
