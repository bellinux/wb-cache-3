Tuten Foot in the Electronic Door 4 Getting a foot in the electronic door: Understanding why people read or delete electronic mail For researchers, a key issue in developing electronic <b>mail</b> as a <b>survey</b> method is to understand what factors are at play as a potential respondent chooses to open or delete a mail message. This research investigated {{the process by which}} individuals make decisions about opening and reading versus deleting electronic mail and also assessed attitudes towards electronic <b>mail</b> <b>surveys.</b> The sample received an electronic mail message followed by a telephone interview. Results indicated that individuals delete mail when the subject line does not interest them or when they do not recognize the name of the individual sending the email. Those interviewed reacted favorably to electronic <b>mail</b> <b>surveys</b> for scientific research despite issues of anonymity. However, respondents overwhelmingly described a dislike for commercially based electronic <b>mail</b> <b>surveys.</b> Tracy L.

40|$|Although {{contingent}} valuation {{is the dominant}} technique for the valuation of public projects, especially in the environmental sector, {{the high costs of}} {{contingent valuation}} surveys prevent the use of this method for the assessment of relatively small projects. The reason for this cost problem is that typically only contingent valuation studies which are based on face-to-face interviews are accepted as leading to valid results. Particularly in countries with high wages, face-to-face surveys are extremely costly considering that for a valid contingent valuation study a minimum of 1000 completed face-to-face interviews is required. This paper tries a rehabilitation of <b>mail</b> <b>surveys</b> as low-budget substitutes for costly face-to-face surveys. Based on an empirical contingent valuation study in Northern Thailand, it is shown that the validity of <b>mail</b> <b>surveys</b> can be improved significantly if so-called Citizen Expert Groups are employed for a thorough survey design. contingent valuation, <b>mail</b> <b>surveys,</b> citizen expert groups, willingness to pay, Thailand, convergent validity,...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} participants who completed a <b>mailed</b> <b>survey,</b> compared to those initial non-responders who completed the same survey over the telephone. Study Design and Patient Populations: We conducted a <b>mailed</b> <b>survey,</b> in both Spanish and English, among women with abnormal Pap smears, {{who were members of}} a large managed care organization. Telephone follow up for non-responders was performed by a bilingual interviewer. A 20 -minute long distance telephone card was offered as an incentive to individuals who completed the telephone survey. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to {{describe the}} population characteristics of respondents who replied by mail, as compared to those who completed the survey by telephone. Results: Of the 1049 potentially eligible participants, 733 women completed the survey, for an overall response rate of 70 %. Fifty-six percent (N 5411) of the surveys were received by mail, and 44 % (N 5322) were completed by telephone. Thirty-four percent of the telephone surveys were completed in Spanish, compared to 13 % of the <b>mailed</b> <b>surveys</b> (P,. 001). Telephone respondents were less satisfied with their health care than were those who responded by mail. Conclusions: Among this insured cohort of women, Latinas who completed the survey in Spanish were more likely to participate in a telephone survey that offered an incentive, than in a <b>mailed</b> <b>survey.</b> These findings should be considered when planning health surveys in this population...|$|R

Most of the scientists accepted that global warming was occurring and appropriate policy action should be taken, but there was wide disagreement about the likely effects on society and almost all agreed that the predictive ability of currently existing models was limited. On a scale of 1 (highest confidence) to 7 (lowest confidence) regarding belief in the ability to make [...] "reasonable predictions" [...] the mean was 4.8 and 5.2 for 10- and 100-year predictions, respectively.

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} the effectiveness {{and costs of}} follow-up phone calls in improving response rates to a community survey. Methods: Non-responders to a postal survey were randomly allocated to receive a phone call or no phone call. The resources used for {{the development and implementation}} of the survey were documented. The response rates and cost per level of follow-up contact examined. Results: Follow-up phone calls led to a statistical significant increase in the number of responses to a community-wide survey, relative to no phone call. This relative increase in responses (n= 62 for the follow-up phone call group versus n= 1 for controls), did not increase the absolute survey response rate sufficiently (from 38. 5 % for two <b>mailed</b> <b>surveys</b> to 39. 8 % for two <b>mailed</b> <b>surveys</b> plus a phone call) to justify the phone call costs. Scenario analyses show increasing the initial response rate by 10 % and conducting a second <b>mailed</b> <b>survey</b> achieves greater marginal cost savings than increasing the response rate to the second mailout or the follow-up phone calls. Conclusions: These results suggest a follow-up phone call was not cost effective. Survey research ought to primarily focus on obtaining optimal initial response rates by using strategies identified in a Cochrane meta-analytic review...|$|R
