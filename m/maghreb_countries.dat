2500|$|Berber {{is spoken}} by large populations of Algeria, Morocco and Libya, and by smaller populations of Tunisia, {{northern}} Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso, Mauritania {{and in the}} Siwa Oasis of Egypt. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, {{have been living in}} Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> are considered to have Berber ancestors.|$|E
2500|$|After independence, all the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> {{to varying}} degrees pursued a policy of Arabisation, aimed partly at {{displacing}} French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy.

This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially Kabylie—and was addressed in both countries by introducing the Berber language in some schools and by recognising Berber as a [...] "national language" [...] in Algeria, though not as an official one.|$|E
40|$|Population {{development}} and emigration of <b>Maghreb's</b> <b>countries</b> Abstract The main aim of diploma thesis is {{to map the}} migratory situation and trends of all area since 1990 {{up to the present}} in context of the population development in region of <b>Maghreb's</b> <b>countries.</b> This all is in connection with the population growth of the states - natural and total. Apart from the analysis of the whole Maghreb as one unit, the demographic parameters are in detail assessed on the example Tunisia. It is estimated that migratory streams of the inhabitants of North Africa's countries are largely directed to Europe. The analasis is focused on the breakdown of the target countries, emigrants and on changes during the reporting period. The analasis uses conventional demographic indicators, its own methods of processing often difficult available data {{at the same time and}} empirical investigation. The initial basis of analyzing given issues show the theoretical conception of population development in Arabic countries, with emphasis on demographic transition and dependent migratory transition. Analysis revealed that none of <b>Maghreb's</b> <b>countries</b> has not yet completed demographic transition, the second stage of the demographic transition since 2000 suspended.

Their aim was to prevent people from citing religion as a justification for genital mutilation. The authors cited the work of Islamic legal expert Ibn al-Hajj as support for their assertion that [...] "uch practices were not present in the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> over the past centuries". FGM is [...] "not an instinctive habit, according to the Malkis; therefore, it was abandoned in northern and western regions of the country," [...] added the authors.|$|E
2500|$|To this day, {{couscous}} {{is known}} as 'the North Africa national dish'. [...] Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple. [...] It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries.</b> Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten {{in most of the}} Turkish southern provinces.|$|E

40|$|Algeria is {{the core}} of the Maghreb and shares land borders with seven <b>countries</b> <b>Maghreb</b> and Sahel <b>countries.</b> However, since 2011, none of the seven land borders is stable and se-cure. So, even if Algeria is {{considered}} as a stable country, this stability is fragile and is likely to be more precarious if the country has to face simultaneously an economic crisis and deli-cate presidential succession. Domestic incertitude coupled to regional conflicts puts the Algerian borders under unprecedented pressure. Consequently, almost all the governmental declarations expressed worries about the vulnerability of the borders, and assurances about the security services determination to assure the state security. However, to what extant this promise can be entirely fulfilled, regarding the borders’ characteristics and the specificity of the context? Why is the virtualization of the borders forced? As regards to the growing per-meability of the borders, can their militarization guarantee their security...|$|R

40|$|Migration from sub-Saharan Africa to European shores became {{increasingly}} difficult and dangerous. <b>Maghreb</b> transit <b>countries</b> return migrants to their southern borders, and member {{states of the}} Europe enforced its expulsion policy. In Mali {{this leads to the}} frequent arrival of failed migrants, too ashamed to return to their families. Often, these returnees are in need of medical care. Cut off from traditional social networks, they gather in the city. Since 2005, returnees increasingly engaged in self-help groups. The organisations are offering assistance, first aid and medical care for returnees. Initiated out of the transnational experience of returned migrants, the work of these organisations answers the needs of failed migrants as an emergent urban social group, and is located within the framework of international health organisations.

5000|$|Arab {{identity}} {{can also}} be seen through a lens of local or regional identity. Throughout Arab history, there have been three major national trends in the Arab world. Arabism rejects states' existing sovereignty as artificial creations and calls for full Arab unity. The regional national orientation recognizes distinct differences in identity between the Arab <b>Maghreb</b> (the Arab <b>countries</b> of North Africa), the Arab East and Arab states of the Persian Gulf, each working in their own regional interests and seeing themselves closer to their neighbors than Arabs in other [...] "regions". The third is the local national trend, which insists on preserving the independence and sovereignty of existing states, and reconciling these different forms of Arab nationalism remains an obstacle to the consolidation of a consistent concept of a nationalist Arab identity across the Middle East and North Africa.|$|R
40|$|There is global {{concern about}} the {{relation}} between international migration and {{the course of the}} AIDS epidemic. Maghreb is a North African region, which lies between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. It has been turned recently into a region of immigration, since {{there are more and more}} flows of West African migrants hoping to reach European countries. Here we provide an overview on HIV- 1 molecular epidemiology particularly in West African <b>countries,</b> <b>Maghreb</b> (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and southern European countries (Spain, France, and Italy). The studies conducted in several countries of the region revealed different features of HIV- 1 molecular epidemiology, especially for the distribution of viral subtypes and for transmitted drug resistance profiles. Furthermore, migration from West Africa to Europe seems to be a potential source of non-B subtype mobility to Maghreb and eventually to southern Europe, where HIV- 1 non-B variants significantly increased in the last 10 to 15 years. As genetic differences between subtypes might impact the drug resistance pathways, it is important to provide continuous surveillance programs for the early detection of new variants spreading in the population before they become more prevalent, and to identify resistance profiles in different infected populations, especially migrants...|$|R

50|$|What was {{the impact}} of {{aesthetic}} choices of films made during this period? Films such as Africa on seine, Borom sarret, The Black Girl, that were shot {{in the first decade}} of independence were precursors of militant and radical film-making whose content and themes were aligned to the spirit of the Charter of Algiers. During this period of political activism - with the exception of Ousmane Sembène, who recalls his film Emitaï (1971) the resistance of peasants and farmers in Casamance to requisitioning of rice during the Second World War - few filmmakers were interested in making films on resistance and colonialism - while filmmakers in the <b>Maghreb</b> or Arabic <b>countries</b> were focused on that genre. The majority of films shot in black francophone Africa were characterized mainly by social disputes, which illustrated themes that spoke of social ills and difficulties common in films such as Borom Sarret (1963, by Ousmane Sembène), regarded as the first short film to denounce neo-colonialism. In his other film Xala (1974) Sembène juxtaposes tradition and modernity. Touki Bouki in (1972), by Djibril Diop Mambety, marked a break with the narrative form of classical films of this period and was seen as among the most militant. The time for questions and the crisis The awakening of conscientious filmmakers to renew their activist past was supported by the revolutionary regime of Burkina headed by Captain Sankara in 1983. The third FEPACI congress was held on the ninth edition of FESPACO in 1985. The FEPACI headquarters was moved to Ouagadougou and filmmaker Gaston Kabore was appointed to the post of Secretary General and remained there until 1997. Gaston Kabore restored the Film Federation.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the account}} of a journey through the Sahara, from the <b>Maghreb</b> to the <b>countries</b> of the Sahel. The writer {{describes}} {{the history of the}} area and the technology, styles and backgrounds of its architecture. This is alternated with an account of the writer's experiences during the trip through a port of the continent whose roads are particularly difficult to negotiate. The journey leads from Algiers, whose ancient casbah {{is in a state of}} very bad repoir, to the cities of the M'zab in Northern Algeria. The medieval towns in this oasis have managed to preserve their historie city centres very well; they are characteristic of the Islamic architecture and urban development of the Maghreb. The natural beauty of Ihe Sahara makes a profound impression on the travellers. They are forced to drastically shorlen their intended course due to a serious breakdown of their car. The mud architecture of the Sahara and the Sahel is discussed extensively in its various aspects. A description is given of the old trading towns south of Ihe desert which were once visited by the caravans: Agadez, Goo and Djenné. The architectural style of the Sudan, represented most specifically in its mosques, reaches its climax here. In Mali the writer visits several villages of the animistic Dogon, a tribe of farmers whose architecture is intrinsically tied up with their philosophy of life and permeated with symbolism. Finally, the journey leads to Burkina Faso, in which country mud architeclure gradually gives way to the timber construction of the more humid, wooded regions of the south. Continuons influences from outside threaten the cultural heritage. The monuments and cities visited are often regarded as primitive by the local population. local and international investments in the preservation of these cultural expressions are therefore desirable.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s {{migrants}} from <b>Maghreb</b> and sub-Saharan <b>countries</b> irregularly cross the Strait of Gibraltar, {{in hopes of}} a better future {{for themselves and their}} families. Travelling in small, poorly equipped boats without experienced captains is a life-threatening endeavour and has cost the life of myriad border crossers. Many of these bodies will never be recovered and the bereaved will never know whether their relatives and friends are alive or not and thus they are often captured in a state of not-knowing. But even if a body is recovered, families rarely get notice of the demise, the circumstances of death, and the whereabouts of the remains. In this paper, I will depict the fate of recovered bodies at Spanish shores by focusing on their mobility and uncertain belongings after death. A dead body passes through different stages: the body might be stored in a morgue for months, moved within the same cemetery after years, or – once identified – repatriated or transferred to another country. Diverse and unknown national and religious belongings of the dead, which remain in Spain, are often homogenised by dominant local burial practices. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop an analysis of diverging post-mortem treatments by emphasising on different actors involved. To do so, I firstly show in how far border-related deaths influence and shape moralities, feelings, and actions of local people; secondly, I shift the focus to power relations within identification processes, which prevent or enable grief and mourning rituals. Finally, I will conclude that the analysis of the mobility (or immobility) and uncertain belongings reveals not only different forms of ethical practices of local actors but also mechanisms of power within the management of the dead bodies at Europe’s shores...|$|R
