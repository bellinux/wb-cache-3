40|$|The buccoadhesive tablets of Repaglinide were {{prepared}} {{with the objective}} of avoiding the first pass metabolism as well as to evaluate the sustained release component of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> and compared with the carbopol. The buccoadhesive tablets {{were prepared}} by direct compression method using different composition of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> as a primary polymer, and secondary polymer like HPMC K 4 M, Sodium CMC and Karaya gum. The formulations were evaluated for the hardness, thickness, weight variation, content uniformity, surface pH, swelling index, in-vitro bioadhesion, in-vitro mucoadhesion retention time, in-vitro drug release kinetics. The modified physical balance was used to measure the in-vitro bioadhesion strength, using fresh goat buccal mucosa as a model tissue. The best mucoadhesive performance and in-vitro drug release profile were exhibited by the tablet containing <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> and Sodium CMC in the ratio of 1 : 1. The mechanism and order of drug release from the tablets were non-Fickian diffusion (values of n between 0. 5 to 1. 0) and first order kinetics, respectively. The formulation containing 1 : 1 ratio of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> and Sodium CMC, showed good bioadhesion strength (33. 21 ± 4. 48), mucoadhesion time (399 ± 4. 76) and controlled release property (95. 3 % after 8 h) as well as acceptable surface pH (5. 9 ± 0. 4) to the buccal mucosa. The stability studies of buccoadhesive tablets were evaluated for their physico-chemical parameters such as colour, shape, thickness and drug contents which exhibit no changes, suggesting the satisfactory stability of buccal tablets in human saliva...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{repair or}} {{regeneration}} {{is a common}} and complicated clinical problem in orthopedic surgery. The importance of natural polymers, such as <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan,</b> and minerals such as HAp and β-TCP, has grown significantly {{over the last two}} decades due to their renewable and biodegradable source, increasing the knowledge and functionality of composites in technological and biomedical applications. This study compares the biodegradation process, bioactivity, structure, morphology, and mechanical properties of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> and microcrystalline chitosan/β-TCP complex; the latter according to the new method of preparation. The complex showed a homogeneous network structure with regular pores, good bioactivity, even after 60 days of conducting the hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation process, showing a bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. The complex indicates that it could be used successfully as a base for implants and scaffolds production in orthopedic surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented herewith was to obtain a composition of a selected chitosan usabili-ty form with poly-N-vinylopyrolidone which could be used as the basis for a modern dressing materi-al or a dressing confection of optimal biological activity., <b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> or gels of chitosan salts of diferentiated average molecular weight and similar deacetylation degree were used to obtain the composition with poly-N-vinylopyrolidone. Films were formed from the obtained compositions, which were next tested to assess their mechanical properties. Antibacterial tests were carried out for selected forms of chitosan, proving their activity against the Escherichia coli ATCC 11220 bacteria...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} chitosan-microcrystalline cellulose blends as direct compression excipients. Crab shell chitosan, α-lactose monohydrate, and microcrystalline cellulose powders were characterized. Blends of the <b>microcrystalline</b> cellulose and <b>chitosan</b> in ratios 9 [*]:[*] 1, 4 [*]:[*] 1, 2 [*]:[*] 1, and 1 [*]:[*] 1 as direct compression excipients were made to constitute 60 % of metronidazole tablets. Similar tablets containing blends of the microcrystalline cellulose and α-lactose monohydrate {{as well as those}} containing pure microcrystalline cellulose were also produced. The compact density, tensile strength, porosity, disintegration time, and dissolution rate of tablets were determined. Chitosan had higher moisture content (7. 66 %) and higher moisture sorption capacity (1. 33 %) compared to microcrystalline cellulose and lactose. It also showed better flow properties (Carr’s index of 18. 9 % and Hausner’s ratio of 1. 23). Compact density of tablets increased but tensile strength decreased with increase in the proportion of chitosan in the binary mixtures. In contrast to lactose, the disintegration time increased and the dissolution rate decreased with increase in the proportion of chitosan. This study has shown that chitosan promotes flowability of powder mix and rapid disintegration of tablet. However, incorporation of equal proportions of <b>microcrystalline</b> cellulose and <b>chitosan</b> leads to production of extended-release tablet. Therefore, chitosan promotes tablet disintegration at low concentration and enables extended-release at higher concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the influence of type of chitosan with different molecular weights, ie, 190 and 419 kDa, on properties of pellets prepared by extrusion/ spheronization. The formulations, consisting of acetaminophen as model drug, <b>chitosan,</b> <b>microcrystalline</b> cellulose (MCC), and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate with/without sodium alginate, were extruded using a twin-screw extruder and water as the granulating liquid. With 30 % wt/wt MCC and no added sodium alginate, spherical pellets were produced containing low and high molecular weight chitosan at a maximum amount of 60 % and 40 % wt/wt, respectively. With sodium alginate (2. 5 % wt/wt), pellets with either type of chitosan (60 % wt/wt), MCC (17. 5 % wt/wt), and acetaminophen (20 % wt/wt) could be produced indicating an improved pelletforming ability. Type and amount of chitosan and added sodium alginate affected physical properties of pellets including size, roundness, crushing force, and drug release. Low molecular weight chitosan produced pellets with higher mean diameter, sphericity, and crushing force. Additionally, the pellets made of low molecular weight chitosan and added sodium alginate showed faster drug release in 0. 1 N HCl but had slower drug release in pH 7. 4 phosphate buffer. This indicated that drug release from pellets could be modified by the molecular weight of chitosan. In conclusion, the molecular weight of chitosan had a major influence on formation, physical properties, and drug release from the obtained pellets...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to prepare composite surgical meshes modified by chitosan. The poly-propylene mesh OPTOMESHTM Macropore {{is used as}} the half product onto which a coating of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> with a lowered pH is deposited. The thus modified surgical mesh is sterilized by means of ethylene oxide and assessed in respect to physical–mechani-cal and biological properties. Cytotoxicity, irritating and allergenic testing {{was carried out in}} specialized medical institutions. All examinations made of the microcrystalline chitosan-coated meshes confirmed their biocompatibility as acceptable for potential uses in surgery. Hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of the meshes was estimated, too. It was found that after 180 days the chitosan coating had lost 50 % of its original weight when immersed in a bath at 37 °C containing 10 µg/cm 3 of lysozyme...|$|E
40|$|Arterial {{catheterization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently performed inpatient diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the development countries. Complications may occur after any catheterization from inadequate hemostasis, particularly in the setting of aggressive anticoagulation. This study suggests that <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> (MCCh) sealant installation via an arterial sheath at the completion of catheterization may improve hemostasis. Results using MCCh in eight heparinized dogs documented significant reductions in manual compression time (P = 0. 016) of the artery after withdrawal of both the sheath introducer and catheter. Comparative results were found in rats, wherein a created wound in the aorta could be sealed relatively quickly and easily. The biodegradability, optimalization, and a better pharmaceutical formulation of this potential hemostatic agent require further studies. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe cell’s {{cytoskeleton}} {{together with}} the cell membrane and numerous accessory proteins determines the mechanical properties of cell. Any factors influencing cell organization and structure can cause alterations in mechanical properties of cell (its ability for deformation and adhesion). The determination of the local elastic properties of cells in their culture conditions has opened the possibility for the measurement {{of the influence of}} different factors on the mechanical properties of the living cells. The effect of the chitosan on the stiffness of the non-malignant transitional epithelial cells of ureter (HCV 29) and the transitional cell cancer of urine bladder (T 24) was determined using scanning force microscopy. The investigations were performed in the culture medium (RPMI 1640) containing 10 % fetal calf serum {{in the presence of the}} <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> of the three different deacetylation degrees. In parallel, the effect of chitosan on production of lactate and ATP level was determined. The results showed the strong correlation between the decrease of the energy production and the increase in Young’s modulus values obtained for the cancer cells treated with chitosan...|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletal}} {{system in the}} human body is very important, provides support and gives shape to the body and provides a network between all soft tissues. The most common problems in hard tissues are bone fractures, defects or diseases which needed to be treated. The developments in artificial bone area seem to solve most of the hard tissue problems, on the other hand artificial bones themselves may cause other problems and in many cases they do not have sufficient mechanical properties and/or good biocompatibility. The importance of chitosan and its derivatives like mi-crocrystalline chitosan has grown significantly {{over the last two decades}} due to its renewable and biodegradable source, and also because of the increase in the knowledge of its functionality in the technological and biomedical applications. The excellent biocompability, biofunctionality, and non-antigenic property make the chitosan and its derivatives as a <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> an ideal material for tissue regeneration. To improve the suitability of chitosan for bone tissue engi-neering, the composites of MCCh and hydroxyapatite were studied. In the present work the cha-racterization of the MCCh and composites with HAp in form of films and sponges, is based on phy-sico-chemical tests, morphology, structure, particle size of HAp powder and distribution in th...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the mechanical and sorption features of homogeneous and composite membranes which consist of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>chitosan</b> (MCCh) and fibrin (Fb) in various proportions as well as the in vitro kinetics of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) released from ten types of membranes in the presence or absence of amoxicillin (Am). The films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, mechanical tests: breaking strength (Bs) and elongation at break (Eb), as well as SEM images, and swelling study. The influence of the form of samples (dry or wet) on Young’s modulus (E) was also examined. The homogeneous MCCh (M 1) and composite M 3 and M 4 (MCCh[*]:[*]Fb = 2 [*]:[*] 1 and 1 [*]:[*] 1) membranes were characterized by good sorption properties and higher mechanical strength, when compared with Fb (M 2) membrane. Connecting MCCh with Fb decreases release of PDGF-BB and increases release of Am. The most efficient release of PDGF-BB was observed in the case of M 4 (the optimum MCCh[*]:[*]Fb ratio was 1 [*]:[*] 1) membrane. It was found that the degree of PDGF-BB release from the membrane is influenced by the physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of the films and by its affinity to growth factor PDGF-BB...|$|E
