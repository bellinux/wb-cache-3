40|$|Two {{long-haired}} Siamese {{cats are}} reported with clinical manifestations of human mucopolysaccharidosis VI (<b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease)</b> : facial dysmorphia, dysostosis multiplex, paralysis. Urine {{of the two}} affected animals contained {{a high concentration of}} glycosaminoglycans, as detected by the dimethylmethylene blue test. Qualitative analysis, performed by thin-layer chromatography of the cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable material, showed dermatan sulphate. Excessive incorporation of [35 S]sulphate in the intracellular mucopolysaccharide of cultured fibroblasts and deficiency of arylsulphatase B in such cells indicate that these cats are affected by <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease.</b> They should thus be considered the first European case of feline mucopolysaccharidosis VI...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease</b> or {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type VI is {{an inherited}} severe metabolic disorder {{which is very}} rare. It {{is caused by a}} deficiency of the enzyme Arylsulfatase B and characterized by a heterogeneous clinical, radiological and genetic presentation. We report a case of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome in a child aged 9 years whose diagnosis was suspected clinically by the combination of a dysmorphic syndrome, prominent ophthalmological signs, hepatomegaly and normal intelligence...|$|E
40|$|The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of inborn errors of lysosomal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The {{importance of this}} group of disorders among the inborn errors of metabolism led us to report 19 cases. METHOD: We performed clinical, radiological, and biochemical evaluations of the suspected patients, which allowed us to establish a definite diagnosis in 19 cases. RESULTS: Not all patients showed increased GAG levels in urine; enzyme assays should be performed in all cases with strong clinical suspicion. The diagnosis was made on average {{at the age of}} 48 months, and the 19 MPS cases, after a full clinical, radiological, and biochemical study, were classified as follows: Hurler [...] MPS I (1 case); Hunter [...] MPS II (2 cases); Sanfilippo [...] MPS III (2 cases); Morquio [...] MPS IV (4 cases); Maroteaux-Lamy [...] MPS VI (9 cases); and Sly [...] MPS VII (1 case). DISCUSSION: The high relative frequency of <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease</b> contrasts with most reports in the literature and could express a population variability...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} (LSD) are inherited diseases caused, in {{the majority}} of them, by the deficiency of lysosomal enzymatic activities. Ob-jectives: We aimed to analyze the usefulness of DBS samples for diagnosis of 4 LSDs, with the availability of a large quantity of patient samples. Design and methods: Blood samples from previously diagnosed patients with Fabry, Gaucher, Hunter, and Maro-teaux-Lamy syndromes and normal control individ-uals, were collected and dispen-sed in filter paper, and used for enzymatic activity determination. Results: Diagnosis of hemi/homo-zygous patients with Fabry, Hunter and <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>diseases</b> using DBS samples showed ideal parameters of 100 % sensitivity and specificity. DBS assay for Gaucher disease would need a posterior confirmatory step. Conclusions: Leukocyte measu-rement is the only reliable way to diagnose Gaucher disease. For Hunter, Fabry and Maroteaux-Lamy disorders discrimination between patients and controls seems adequate by DBS...|$|R
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are {{characterized}} by mental retardation constantly present in the severe forms of Hurler (MPS I), Hunter (MPS II) and Sanfilippo (MPS III) diseases. On the contrary, mental retardation is absent in Morquio (MPS IV) and <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> (MPS VI) <b>diseases</b> and absent or only minimal in the attenuated forms of MPS I, II and III. Considering that MPS patients affected by mental disease accumulate heparan sulfate (HS) due to specific enzymatic defects, we hypothesized a possible correlation between urinary HS-derived glucosamine (GlcN) accumulated in tissues and excreted in biological fluids and mental retardation. 83 healthy subjects were found to excrete HS {{in the form of}} fragments due to the activity of catabolic enzymes that are absent or impaired in MPS patients. On the contrary, urinary HS in 44 patients was observed to be composed of high molecular weight polymer and fragments of various lengths depending on MPS types. On this basis we correlated mental retardation with GlcN belonging to high and low molecular weight HS. We demonstrate a positive relationship between the accumulation of high molecular weight HS and mental retardation in MPS severe compared to attenuated forms. This is also supported by the consideration that accumulation of other GAGs different from HS, as in MPS IV and MPS VI, and low molecular weight HS fragments do not impact on central nervous system disease...|$|R
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI; <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease)</b> {{results from}} the {{deficient}} activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase B (ASB; N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase E. C. 3. 1. 6. 1). The enzymatic defect leads to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycan, dermatan sulfate, primarily in connective tissue and reticuloendothelial cell lysosomes. Although MPS VI patients have normal intelligence and no neurologic abnormalities, the disease is clinically heterogeneous: severely affected individuals expire in childhood or early adolescence while those with the mild or intermediate phenotypes have a slower, milder disease course and a longer life span. The recent isolation of the full-length cDNA-encoding human ASB permitted {{an investigation of the}} molecular lesions underlying the phenotypic heterogeneity in MPS VI. The ASB cDNA-coding sequences were determined from two unrelated MPS VI patients with the severe (proband 1) and mild (proband 2) phenotypes. These patients had about 2 % and 7 % of normal ASB activity in cultured fibroblasts, respectively. Proband 1 was homoallelic for a T-to-C transition in nucleotide (nt) 349, which predicted a cysteine-to-arginine substitution in the ASB polypeptide at residue 117 (C 117 R). Proband 2 was heteroallelic, having a T-to-C transition in nt 707, which predicted a leucine-to-proline replacement at ASB residue 236 (L 236 P), and having a G-to-A transition in nt 1214, which predicted a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at ASB residue 405 (C 405 Y). These mutations did not occur in three other unrelated MPS VI patients or in 120 ASB alleles from normal individuals, indicating that they were not polymorphisms. The identification of these three ASB mutations documents the first evidence of molecular heterogeneity in MPS VI and provides an initial basis for genotype/phenotype correlations in this lysosomal storage disease...|$|E
40|$|Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) is the {{lysosomal}} {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4 -sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulfate moieties on the glycosaminoglycans, dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A. In man, a deficiency of this enzymatic activity causes the lysosomal storage disorder, <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>disease</b> (mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI; MPS VI). MPS VI in Siamese cats {{also has been}} described, and the comparative pathologic and biochemical abnormalities of the human and feline disorders have been well characterized. The present study describes the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding feline ARSB and the assignment of the feline ARSB gene to feline chromosome A 1. The full-length feline ARSB cDNA sequence is 1939 bp, including 3 and 328 bp of 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated sequences, respectively, and a 1608 -bp open reading frame encoding 535 amino acids. The predicted human and feline ARSB proteins are 91 % identical and 94 % similar. However, despite this high homology, the predicted feline ARSB polypeptide has nine cysteine residues, while the human enzyme has eight. The presence of the extra cysteine residue at position 451 in the feline enzyme may explain why feline ARSB is a homodimer and the human enzyme is a monomer. To facilitate comparative structure/function studies of the human and feline enzymes and to initiate somatic gene therapy trials in the MPS VI cats, a full-length feline ARSB cDNA was reconstructed from a 1440 -bp partial cDNA and an ARSB fragment amplified from feline first-strand cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The functional integrity of this cDNA was demonstrated by transient expression in human embryonic kidney cells. The polymerase chain reaction also {{has been used to}} analyze 38 feline/rodent somatic cell hybrids for the presence of the feline ARSB gene. Overall, there was 97 % concordancy between the presence of the feline ARSB gene and feline chromosome A 1. For each of the other chromosomes, at least 34 % of the hybrids were discordant. ARSB is the fifth feline gene to be assigned to chromosome A 1, providing further evidence that this feline chromosome is syntenic with human chromosome 5...|$|E
