A mixed method research approach was adopted which involved methods of data collection such as conducting a 7 week English language and English teaching methodology course. I worked with the PELTs in this course both as a teacher and as a researcher to investigate ways to assist the participants to develop better attitudes and <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>English</b> language and English teaching through action research whereby I adopted an “adopt, adapt, reject” teaching and research procedure to adopt methodological aspects that suited the participants, adapt those that required modification for the Libyan context and reject those that were not suitable.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} Expedition, {{an environment}} designed {{to facilitate the}} quick ramp-up of MT systems from practically any alphabetic language (L) into English. The central component of Expedition is a knowledge elicitation system that guides a linguistically naive bilingual speaker {{through the process of}} describing L in terms of its ecological, morphological, grammatical, lexical, and transfer information. Expedition also includes a module for converting the elicited information into the format expected by the underlying MT system and an MT engine that relies on both the elicited knowledge and resident <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>English.</b> The Expedition environment is integrated using a configuration and control system. Expedition represents an innovative approach to answering the need for rapid-configuration MT by preparing an MT system in which the only missing link is information about L, which is elicited in a structured fashion such that it can be directly exploited by the system. In this paper we report on the current state of Expedition with an emphasis on the knowledge elicitation system. 1...|$|R

40|$|English {{language}} learners (ELs) have shown lower performance in mathematics than non-ELs although mathematics {{is an area}} that uses the least amount of language among the subjects that are mainly tested. If this differential performance is due to the bias in test items, then validity of using ELs’ test scores in comparison to non-ELs’ is compromised. For this reason, studies have investigated whether the differential performance can be attributed to language load in the tests. The results of these studies were not consistent. Some studies did find its effect, whereas others did not. Some of the difficulties encountered by researchers in past studies investigating DIF include a large difference in sample size between the two groups and unclear distinctions between ELs and non-ELs.
