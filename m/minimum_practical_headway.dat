50|$|Regarding new regulations, the ACO {{also set}} {{a number of}} new {{restrictions}} with a view to limit maximum speeds. Prototypes were now given a maximum engine size of 2.5L.

40|$|Attempts to {{determine}} the energy spectrum (or spectral energy distribution) for all values of its wave number argument are a fundamental objective of turbulence theory. Detailed predictions of the energy spectrum are not yet possible {{for more than a}} very few classes of idealized flows. Nevertheless, to make <b>practical</b> <b>headway,</b> it is necessary to evolve a heuristic physical picture of turbulent flow. Of particular interest in partic 1 e-fluid interaction is the comparison of scale lengths in each region of the spectrum. When partic 1 e inertia can be neglected, the diffusion, energy-containing, and inertial subranges of the spectrum are of most interest. While the Kolmogorov theory on the energy cascade is useful for describing the energy processes in an idealized turbulent flow, its applicability to the prediction of turbulence is restricted to isotropic or homogeneous flows (or the isotropic portion of turbulent flows, namely the smaller-scale characteristics of the flow). Most practical flows of interest involve at least violation of isotropy through the introduction of shear and, in most situations, non-homogeneities as a result of shear flow variation. Turbulent energy spectra for such flows are significantly more complicated and must inc 1 ude the features representative of the coherent structures.

The flow in this geometry is highly non uniform, and the turbulence is produced by small fins fixed at the walls of an empty duct, so that the longitudinal vortices and the wake effects predominate over the wall turbulence.

40|$|The Advanced Neutron Source {{will employ}} two cold sources to {{moderate}} neutrons to low energy (< 10 meV). The cold neutrons produced are then passed through beam guides to various experiment stations. Each cold source moderator is a sphere of 410 -mm internal diameter. The moderator material is liquid deuterium flowing {{at a rate}} of 1 kg/s and maintained at subcooled temperatures at all points of the circuit, to prevent boiling. Nuclear beat deposited within the liquid deuterium and its containment structure totals more than 30 kW. All of this heat is removed by the liquid deuterium, which raises its temperature by 5 K. The liquid prime mover is a cryogenic circulator that is situated in the return leg of the flow loop. This arrangement minimizes the heat added to the liquid between the heat exchanger and the moderator vessel, allowing the moderator to be operated at the <b>minimum</b> <b>practical</b> temperature.

40|$|A {{shape for}} a next {{generation}} submarine has been drawn {{based on a}} survey of available knowledge. The reasons for each detailed portion of the shape are explained. The aim of the design is to produce a submarine with <b>minimum</b> <b>practical</b> resistance and with minimum water flow noise especially over the forward passive sonar while still carrying out all its normal functions. It is {{assumed the role of}} the submarine would be little different from the current vessel but may be powered differently and carry different equipment. The diameter of the hull has been increased while the length has been decreased compared to the present vessel. It is estimated the comparative resistance will be reduced by ten percent. The larger diameter will allow an extra deck over a portion of the length of the vessel giving greater flexibility to internal arrangements. All openings in the first five metres of the shape have been moved elsewhere including the torpedo tubes and interceptor array, to give the smoothest possible flow over the forward passive sensors. The nose shape is derived from a NACA forebody with a 14. 2 percent thickness-length ratio and shows a favourable value of the minimum pressure over its length. The question of achieving natural laminar flow over this short length is discussed and found to be possible but is unproven...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fundamental}} {{mechanisms of}} heat transfer through rigid polyure-thane (PUR) foam are reviewed {{in terms of}} three distinct elements, &lambda;g, &lambda;s and &lambda;r, which represent heat transfer by thermal conductivity through the gas phase, solid phase and by radiation respectively. It is demonstrated that values for &lambda;g and &lambda;s can be estimated, and from the measured &lambda;-value of the foam, an approximation of &lambda;r ob-tained by difference. This shows that there is considerable scope for improving the thermal insulation efficiency of these materials. Small reductions in &lambda;-value {{can be obtained by}} op-timisation of &lambda;g and &lambda;s elements, but the main scope for improvement is by reduction of &lambda;r. This can be partially achieved by the production of foam with very fine cells. However there are strong indications that the cell windows are transparent to radiative heat transfer and several other factors need {{to be taken into account}} in re-ducing &lambda;r to its <b>minimum</b> <b>practical</b> value. Combining all these factors, laboratory foams can be produced consistently with &lambda;-values 20 - 30 % lower than typical com-mercial material. &lambda;-value ageing, which results from air ingress into the cells of the foam, can be substantially eliminated by covering the foam with air impermeable barriers. How-ever recent developments have shown that by optimisation of foam formulations, the rate of ageing and the aged &lambda;-value can also be significantly reduced in uncovered foams...|$|R
40|$|In {{hemodialysis}} patients, radiographic imaging with iodinated {{contrast medium}} (ICM) application plays {{a central role}} in the diagnosis and/or follow-up of disease-related conditions. Therefore, safety aspects concerning ICM administration and radiation exposure have a great impact on this group of patients. Current hardware and software improvements including the design and synthesis of modern contrast compounds allow the use of very small amounts of ICM in concert with low radiation exposure. Undesirable ICM side effects are divided into type A (predictable reactions such as heat feeling, headache, and contrast-induced acute kidney injury, for example) and type B (nonpredictable or hypersensitivity) reactions; this chapter deals with the latter. The first onset cannot be prevented. To prevent hypersensitivity upon reexposure of ICM, an allergological workup is recommended. If this is not possible and ICM is necessary, the patient should receive a premedication (H 1 antihistamine with or without corticosteroids). Current imaging hardware and software improvements (e. g. such as additional filtration of the X-ray beam) allow the use of very small amount of ICM and small X-ray doses. Proper communication among the team involved in the treatment of a patient may allow to apply imaging protocols and efficient imaging strategies limiting radiation exposure to a <b>minimum.</b> <b>Practical</b> recommendations will guide the reader how to use radiation and ICM efficiently to improve both patient and staff safety...|$|R
