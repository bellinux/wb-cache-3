40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of {{methyl n-butyl ketone}} {{is known}} to be enhanced by combination with methyl ethyl ketone. This study was conducted to clarify the potentiating effect of aliphatic monoketones on the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone. Rats were subcutaneously injected in the back with 4 mmol/kg/day of methyl ethyl ketone, methyl n-propyl ketone, <b>methyl</b> <b>n-amyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> or methyl n-hexyl ketone mixed with an equimolar dose of methyl n-butyl ketone five days a week for 20 weeks. The maximum motor fibre conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves of the treated animals and controls. All the monoketones tested enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone. Of the compounds tested, methyl n-hexyl ketone, which had the longest carbon chain, enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone most strongly. These results suggest that the length of the carbon chain of the aliphatic monoketones combined with methyl n-butyl ketone was related to the enhancement of the neurotoxicity of the neurotoxic compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{symmetrical}} thioboranes (RS) 3 B, where R= <b>methyl,</b> n-propyl, n-butyl, <b>n-amyl</b> and phenyl, {{have been}} synthesized. Standard heats of formation {{and the energy}} (E) of the boron-sulphur bond were evaluated for each compound in the series. E(B-S) {{was found to be}} nearly constant except for trimethylthioborane. The synthesis and thermochemistry of tricyclohexylboron and compounds of the series 3 -nBXn where X-C 1, Br and n= 0, 1, 2, have been carried out. Standard heats of formation, enthalpies of transition and boron-carbon bond energies of these compounds are reported, the strength of the boron-phenyl bond was found to increase with successive replacement of phenyl by halogen, and this was interpreted in terms of structural features. The results of a single crystal X-ray crystallographic examination of triphenylboron are given. The synthesis and thermochemistry of the substituted derivatives are reported. The conjunctive effect of substituents in the aromatic ring on the adjacent dioxaboron ring was found to be negligible. Comparison of the experimental heats of formation with those calculated from a standard set of bond energies indicated that these molecules were strained to the extent. This was interpreted in terms of two opposing effects, (i) strain in the five-membered ring and (ii) resonance energy. A simple geometric method for estimating strain energies in boron hetero-cycles is derived and discussed. <p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{follows a}} {{feasibility}} study (187) which {{suggested that a}} process for purifying wet-process phosphoric acid by solvent extraction should be economically viable. The work was divided into two main areas, (i) chemical and physical measurements on the three-phase system, with or without impurities; (ii) process simulation and optimization. The object was to test the process technically and economically and to optimise the type of solvent. The chemical equilibria and distribution curves for the system water - phosphoric acid - solvent for the solvents n-amyl alcohol, tri-n-butyl phosphate, di-isopropyl ether and methyl isobutyl ketone have been determined. Both pure phosphoric acid and acid containing known amounts of naturally occurring impurities (Fe P 0 4, A 1 P 0 4, Ca 3 (P 04) Z and Mg 3 (P 0 4) Z) were examined. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the systems were also studied. The experimental results obtained for drop size distribution were compared with those obtainable from Hinze's equation (32) and {{it was found that}} they deviated by an amount related to the turbulence. A comprehensive literature survey on the purification of wet-process phosphoric acid by organic solvents has been made. The literature regarding solvent extraction fundamentals and equipment and optimization methods for the envisaged process was also reviewed. A modified form of the Kremser-Brown and Souders equation to calculate the number of contact stages was derived. The modification takes into account the special nature of phosphoric acid distribution curves in the studied systems. The process flow-sheet was developed and simulated. Powell's direct search optimization method was selected in conjunction with the linear search algorithm of Davies, Swann and Campey. The objective function was defined as the total annual manufacturing cost and the program was employed to find the optimum operating conditions for anyone of the chosen solvents. The final results demonstrated the following order of feasibility to purify wet-process acid: di-isopropyl ether, methylisobutyl <b>ketone,</b> <b>n-amyl</b> alcohol and tri-n-butyl phosphate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{airborne}} concentrations of analytes of occupa-tional health significance for workers engaged in commercial-scale processing of polyethylene were measured. Eight polyethylene resins, selected primarily from those produced using an advanced solution-phase process, were extruded under commercial-scale processing conditions appropriate to their application: blown and cast film; and blow-, injection-, and rotational-molding. Air samples {{were taken from}} operator breathing zones and representative workplace air using recognized {{occupational health and safety}} protocols. The compounds selected consisted of aldehydes (acetaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde, formaldehyde, n-valeraldehyde), ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, THF, <b>methyl</b> <b>n-amyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> ethyl butyl ketone, ketene), organic acids (acetic, formic, and propanoic), aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes), and other compounds (nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, paraffin wax fume). Of the 488 concentrations measured from operator breathing zones and workplace air, 466 were below sampling method detection limits. Twelve of the remaining 22 concentrations were less than 20 % of the established exposure limits, and were therefore considered to present a statistically insignificant exposure risk. Five of the remaining 10 measurements consisted of ketene concentrations, which were found to be below detection limits upon retesting. The other five concentrations, of ozone, were also retested and found to be below detection limits. It is concluded that commercial-scale polyethylene extrusion presents minimal inhalation hazards in an adequately ventilated workplace.
