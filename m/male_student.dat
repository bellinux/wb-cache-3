5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a <b>male</b> <b>student</b> {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid <b>male</b> <b>student</b> teachers.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a <b>male</b> <b>student,</b> and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the <b>male</b> <b>student</b> was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine four {{variables}} that impact African American <b>male</b> <b>students??????</b> perceptions of their transition from elementary school to middle school. This study determined what role social, emotional, physical, and academic variables have in the transition process from elementary school to middle school for African American males. The two guiding questions for this mixed methods study were: 1. What are African American <b>male</b> <b>students??????</b> perceptions of personal development variables on their transition from elementary school to middle school? 2. How do African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> describe their transitional experience from elementary school to middle school? Participants in this study were 149 African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> from five middle schools in southeast Texas. Findings of the study were derived from the use of a self-developed 52 -item questionnaire (Student Transition Perception Survey) with one free-response question and interviews of ten students (two from each school). The major findings in this study were: 1. Social variable ??????African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> felt that schools did not provide a positive school climate, teachers did not treat them with respect, and their parents were supportive of their education. 2. Emotional variable ??????African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> felt that schools did not make them feel successful, and they did not feel equal to their peers. 3. Physical variable ??????African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> were equally divided in the acceptance of their physical appearance and when they compared themselves to others. 4. Academic variable ??????African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> felt that teachers did not give them valuable attention in class. 5. When looking at the trend of student responses among the five schools, African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> shared similar feelings about the social, emotional, physical, and academic variables. 6. African American <b>male</b> <b>students</b> expressed their feelings about being unsafe, experiencing differentiated teacher treatment, declining grades, and difficulty in their middle school transition...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the study of apology {{strategies}} and the similarities and/or the differences of the types of apology strategies used by the female and the <b>male</b> <b>students.</b> My respondents consist of 20 female and 20 <b>male</b> <b>students</b> of the English Department. This study used the theory of Ogiermann (2009). I constructed my own Discourse Completion Test (DCT) questionnaire consisting of 10 simulated classroom situations. The quantitative approach was used in this study. The finding revealed that the first three most dominant types of strategies used by the both of them were expression of regret, acceptance of responsibility and justification. The similarities and/or the differences of the three most dominant types of apology between the female and the <b>male</b> <b>students</b> were found in the percentage use of apology strategies. Expression of regret was used 52. 8 % by the female students and 47 % by the <b>male</b> <b>students.</b> The female students used 53. 3 % and the <b>male</b> <b>students</b> used 46. 6 % in acceptance of responsibility. Justification was used 52. 7 % by the female and 47. 3 % by the <b>male</b> <b>students.</b> For that reason, the female and the <b>male</b> <b>students</b> tend to use the same types of apology strategies, although their percentages are only slightly different...|$|R
40|$|This study theorizes how Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> narrate their {{experiences}} at a traditionally White institution (TWI). To date, research focusing on Black men {{in higher education}} highlights the continual struggles of Black men against racism (Feagin, Vera, 2 ̆ 6 Imani, 1996; Harper, 2006, 2009, 2012; Smith, Yosso, 2 ̆ 6 Solórzano, 2007); however, what remains to be extensively theorized is Black male academic excellence. Thus, I {{argue that it is}} vital to progressively broaden what we know about Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> as intellectuals. In this study I forefront how Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> articulate their intellectual identities and educational experiences on a traditionally White campus. Guided by critical race theory (CRT), this study positions Black male undergraduate interviewees to speak to the following themes: 1) racism as everyday, 2) Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 educational experiences, and 3) counterstories that resist dominant racial ideologies. Their narratives are crucial because the voices and experiences of Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> are often marginalized in higher education in general, and the field of communication in particular. Ultimately, insight gained from this study encourages scholars to include Black <b>male</b> <b>students</b> who academically excel in the realm of academic inquiry, especially scholars who have an interest in the success of Black <b>male</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R
