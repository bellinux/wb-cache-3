Driveability characteristics were generally superior {{to those of the}} 1-barrel engine, but to avoid cutting into sales of the more expensive V8 engine, this 2-barrel setup was not offered in the North American market. Of particular note is the automatic choke design found in this export 2-barrel setup. Most Chrysler products used remote automatic chokes, with a bimetal coil spring mounted on the exhaust manifold, exposed to exhaust heat and operating a pushrod which rotated the choke lever on the carburetor. The export 2-barrel setup used an integral heat-tube style automatic choke: Air heated by the exhaust manifold was routed to a round bakelite housing on the carburetor air horn, which contained a bimetal spring acting directly on the choke lever.|$|E
40|$|Here are {{guidelines}} for deembedding the mounting pads in standard component models to achieve accurate EM simulation By default, Modelithics library models include <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> effects. Hence, when performing full wave electromagnetic (EM) analyses the pad geometries {{should not be}} included in the geometry setup used to define the EM analysis. However, there are reasons to include the pads in the EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models. Some of these reasons are: • Use of a pad size different from the one included with the model, or outside the range of pad dimensions if using a padscalable model. • Including the step effect when the feed line is different from the pad width. This step can also be included using an analytical model in a circuit simulation. • Including the effects of coupling between the pads and another part of the circuit. • Desire to simulate the pads along with other printed circuit patterns as a standard practice. Modelithics models include a feature that allows the pads to be deembedded from the model, thus leaving the part effectively without the pads. This feature, named simulation mode 2, is useful in the case that the pads need to be included in an EM simulation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide some {{guidelines for}} the use of Modelithics models when the effect of the pads is included in EM simulations.

40|$|Lecturepg. 7 Three {{vertical}} pumps at a wastewater {{transfer station}} {{a few miles}} away from the San Andreas Fault and next to an apartment building were the source of vibration and noise complaints. To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained pump base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> and flexible couplings on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone. The flexible couplings however actually increased vibration transmitted into the piping because of excessive stiffness. Based on the initial test results and site observations, a new isolation system was required. Although isolation theory is relatively simple, this paper describes how a detailed three-dimensional analytical treatment was required to properly determine the properties of the isolators, including the influence of adequate seismic restraints.

40|$|The {{interaction}} process {{of a power}} plant building with the soil base is studied basing on mathematical modeling of the construction process of Kambarata- 2 HPP, {{taking into account the}} excavation of foundation pit, the concreting schedule of the building construction, the HPP units putting into operation and territory planning. Mathematical modeling of stress-strain state of the system “power plant - soil base” in the process of construction was performed by using the computer program “Zemlya” (the Earth), which implements the method of finite elements. Such a behavior of soil was described using elastoplastic soil model, the parameters of which were determined from the results of the triaxial tests. As shown by the results of the research, the continuous change of settlement, slope, deflection and torsion of the bottom plate and accordingly change of stressed-strained state of power plant are noted during the construction process. The installed HPP construction schedule, starting from the construction of the first block and the adjacent mounting platform, is leading to the formation of initial roll of bottom plate to the path of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pad.</b> In the process of further construction of powerhouse, up to the 29 th phase of construction (out of 40), a steady increase in its subsidence (maximum values of about 4. 5 cm) is noted. Filling of foundation pit hollows and territorial planning of the construction area lead to drastic situation. In this case, as a territory planning points exceeded the relief, the plastic deformation in the soil evolves, resulting in significant subsidence of the bottom plate under the first block (up to 7. 4 cm). As a result, the additional subsidence of the soil of bottom plate edges lead to the large vertical movement in relation to its central part and it is bent around the X axis, resulting in a large horizontal tensile stress values of Sz (up to 2. 17 MPa) in the constructive elements of {{the upper part of the}} powerhouse. At the same time, the calculations performed on the assumption of instantaneous power plant construction forecast only a uniform slope of bottom plate in the direction of the headwater and do not allow us to track the process of stress-strain state of the power plant for adequate reinforcement of its elements...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support frame with screws. The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid support frames. The effect of angular deviations of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented support frames is modeled: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support frame with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support frame with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid support frame show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith collector angle, respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory support frame allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> is part of a complete optical mirror assessment. The data of standardized shape accuracy measurement serve for subsequent calculation of intercept factors and annual energy yields {{as well as for the}} evaluation of optimization approaches...|$|R
