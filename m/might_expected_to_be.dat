For example, a Node in a graph <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attached <b>to</b> an Edge, and similarly for ColorNode and ColorEdge. This paper analyzes a series of progressively richer constraints that such objects may place on each other, thereby establishing a stratification of several kinds of dependencies in class families. We examine the constraint specification mechanisms available with traditional object-oriented polymorphism, F-bounded parametric polymorphism, and virtual attributes, and explain the trade-o#s. ...|$|R

40|$|Scholars {{know little}} about attitudes toward transracial adoption, how to measure them, or why people hold the attitudes they do. We measure {{implicit}} and explicit attitudes towards transracial adoption. Explicit measures generally find support; implicit measures do not. We also look at correlations between transracial adoption attitudes and racial attitudes. These correlations vary for implicit and explicit measures. Racial bias is associated with explicit reluctance to adopt a black child. Color blindness, which we <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> correlated with positive attitudes toward transracial adoption, is associated with negative implicit evaluations of transracial families...|$|R

50|$|The game, {{which is}} built on the Unreal Engine 3, uses the Nvidia PhysX physics engine. This allows for a destructible environment, as well as {{advanced}} cloth and water effects. The PhysX engine allows players to block passages and create new ones, allowing for more realistic gameplay. For example, after entering the upper floor of a building, a sniper can blow up the stairs behind them to block access, but conversely a rocket blast to the wall that is providing cover will leave them vulnerable. The only parts of the environment that cannot be destroyed are core gameplay objects and/or objects that line the borders of a map. However, due {{to the amount of}} indestructible terrain, many actions which one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possible are not.|$|R

The initial ё (yo) or after a vowel, is often written as йо (yo), which has the same pronunciation: Ёкосука -> Йокосука (Yokosuka), Тоёта -> Тойота (Toyota).
