40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{emphasis of}} this research was to develop a technique which would be a significant improvement over those currently used for flight planning to avoid clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> (CAT). The technique should, ideally, be both quantitative in determining potential intensity and specific in locating regions of relatively high risk. Furthermore, it should not rely on specialized data but be functional using the currently available rawinsonde observation (raob) system. Encouraging results documented in an earlier investigation were considered compelling enough to warrant a closer look into the possibilities of a Specific Clear <b>Air</b> <b>Turbulence</b> Risk (SCATR) index approach to the clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> problem. Unlike that research, which considered sustained periods of flight in light to moderate clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence,</b> this study focuses on several cases of documented severe CAT. Results of these case studies suggest that a SCATR index is not an unrealizable goal and that uses of such an index, event in its current prototype level of development, are also apparent...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere is much disagreement as to (a) what causes clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> (turbulence {{which is not}} in or near convective clouds and is above 15, 000 feet in altitude) and (b) which meteorological parameters {{can be used to}} detect and forecast its occurrence. The approach to this problem has been to relate not one parameter to clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> but various parameters. By summing these parameters areas can be defined where there is a high probability of encountering clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> Each parameter has been based on a statistical study which found a relationship with clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The parameters used were horizontal and vertical shear, curvature, kinetic energy and their derivatives. The numerical forecasting program proposed here can be extended to the stratosphere when more reliable height and temperature fields are available. This program will have much more significance when intermediate forecast height fields, temperature fields and a grid of much smaller mesh length are available.

40|$|The "accepted " {{cause of}} clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> that plagues {{aircraft}} when flying at high altitudes is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability caused by wind shear. However, environmental Richardson numbers associated with air-craft turbulence reports {{are too high}} {{to assume that the}} turbulence is caused just by the environmental wind shear. Forecast techniques developed to date have assumed that there are layers of local Richardson number favorable for turbulence within the larger layer for which it was measured. The forecasts are probabilistic {{in the sense that the}} lower the environmental Richardson num-ber, the more likely somewhere in the layer there will be turbulence. Theory and observations demonstrate that gravity waves can locally modify the wind shear and sta-bility so as to produce turbulence. Analysis of model out-put associated with clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> events suggests that turbulence and indicators of large-scale atmospheric imbalance are related. Since highly unbalanced flow must undergo geostrophic adjustment which is a known cause of gravity waves, clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> may be caused by gravity waves. The conclusion, while preliminary, is that better clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> forecasts will likely come from an ingredients-based technique that includes both environmental wind shear and gravity wave forcing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the effect}} of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> on {{statistics}} relevant to a collision–coalescence process repre-sents a key challenge in the modeling of cloud microphysics. In this paper, collision-related statistics for gravity-driven motion of droplets are considered and various probability distributions associated with geometric configuration and relative motion of colliding droplets are theoretically derived. The theoretical results agree well with numerical results obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNSs). In the absence of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence,</b> the probability distributions, calculated {{at the beginning of the}} time steps used for collision detection, nontrivially depend on the time step size. Next, a novel theory is developed to quantify the effect of turbulence on the angle-of-approach and radial relative velocity |wr,c | for colliding pairs. A logical decomposition is used to construct extended collision volumes for a specific level of radial motion caused by <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> It is shown that the inward relative motion due to turbulent fluctuations dominates the effect of turbulence in modifying the probability distributions of and |wr,c|. Two key dimensionless parameters are identified in the theory: one measures the effect of finite time step size in numerical collision detection and the second measures the relative magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The theory is compared with 11 numerical experiments from DNS.

40|$|An open {{question}} in warm rain process and precipitation formation is how rain forms in warm cumulus {{as rapidly as}} it has sometimes been observed. In general, {{the rapid growth of}} cloud droplets across the size gap from 10 to 50 microns in radius has not been fully explained. Three aspects related to the <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> and stochastic coalescence are considered here in an attempt to resolve this {{open question}}. The first is the enhanced geometric collision rates caused by <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The second is the effect of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> on collision efficiencies. The third is stochastic fluctuations and correlations in the collision-coalescence process. Rigorous approaches are developed to address these issues. Preliminary results indicate that turbulence could shorten the time for drizzle formation to about a half of the time needed for the same growth process based on hydrodynamic-gravitational mechanism alone. To address the effect of stochastic correlations, we derive and validate a true stochastic coalescence equation. It is hoped that this new mean field equation will be useful in the future to improve the deterministic kinetic collection equation...|$|R
