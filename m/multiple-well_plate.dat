5000|$|The analyte is {{also called}} the ligand because it will {{specifically}} bind or ligate to a detection reagent, thus ELISA falls under the bigger category of ligand binding assays. The ligand-specific binding reagent is [...] "immobilized", i.e., usually coated and dried onto the transparent bottom and sometimes also side wall of a well (the stationary [...] "solid phase'/"solid substrate" [...] here as opposed to solid microparticle/beads that can be washed away), which is usually constructed as a <b>multiple-well</b> <b>plate</b> known as the [...] "ELISA plate". Conventionally, like other forms of immunoassays, the specificity of antigen-antibody type reaction is used because {{it is easy to}} raise an antibody specifically against an antigen in bulk as a reagent. Alternatively, if the analyte itself is an antibody, its target antigen can be used as the binding reagent.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{heterogenous}} assay, ELISA separates some {{component of}} the analytical reaction mixture by adsorbing certain components onto a solid phase which is physically immobilized. In ELISA, a liquid sample is added onto a stationary solid phase with special binding properties and is followed by multiple liquid reagents that are sequentially added, incubated and washed followed by some optical change (e.g. color development by {{the product of an}} enzymatic reaction) in the final liquid in the well from which the quantity of the analyte is measured. The qualitative [...] "reading" [...] usually based on detection of intensity of transmitted light by spectrophotometry, which involves quantitation of transmission of some specific wavelength of light through the liquid (as well as the transparent bottom of the well in the <b>multiple-well</b> <b>plate</b> format). The sensitivity of detection depends on amplification of the signal during the analytic reactions. Since enzyme reactions are very well known amplification processes, the signal is generated by enzymes which are linked to the detection reagents in fixed proportions to allow accurate quantification - thus the name [...] "enzyme linked".|$|E
30|$|The embryo {{toxicity}} test procedure followed the OECD guidelines for fish embryo {{toxicity test}}ing [27, 29]. The selected eggs {{were transferred to}} 24 -well multiple-well plates with freshly prepared test solutions. In 20 wells, selected eggs were placed individually in 2  mL of the individual test solutions. The remaining 4 wells per plate were filled with 2  mL of the dilution water and one egg per well as an internal control. The pH values of the control samples were 7.8 [*]±[*] 0.2. Moreover, the dilution solvent {{was used as a}} solvent control in another 24 -well <b>multiple-well</b> <b>plate.</b> All of the wells were covered with a transparent plastic film and were placed on a shaker (at a speed of 40  rpm) in a climate chamber at 26 °C[*]±[*] 1 °C with a 14 : 10 -h light/dark cycle. Each treatment group was tested in parallel in two independent replicates, and each medium was replaced every 24  h.|$|E
40|$|We {{established}} a large-scale, high-throughput protocol to construct Arabidopsis thaliana suspension-cultured cell lines, {{each of which}} carries a single transgene, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We took advantage of RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA clones and the Gateway cloning system for high-throughput preparation of binary vectors carrying individual full-length cDNA sequences. Throughout all cloning steps, <b>multiple-well</b> <b>plates</b> were used to treat 96 samples simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. The optimal conditions for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of 96 independent binary vector constructs were established to obtain transgenic cell lines efficiently. We evaluated the protocol by generating transgenic Arabidopsis T 87 cell lines carrying individual 96 metabolism-related RAFL cDNA fragments, and showed that the protocol was useful for high-throughput and large-scale production of gain-of-function lines for functional genomics...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Interaction between {{nitric oxide}} (NO) and caveolins {{appears to be}} a {{potential}} cellular signal pathway in ischemic brain injury. To elucidate the interaction of NO and caveolins in hypoxic neural cells, we investigated the expressions of caveolin- 1 and caveolin- 2 and NO production in human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells exposed to different periods of hypoxia. Methods: Human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells were grown as a monolayer in minimum essential medium (MEM, Sigma) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10 %, v/v), glutamine (10 mg/ml) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, 10 mg/ml). For hypoxic treatment, confluent monolayers in <b>multiple-well</b> <b>plates</b> were placed in a modular incubator chamber. The cells were consistently incubated with 2 % O 2 plus 5 % CO 2 balanced with N 2 gas for 8, 15, 24 and 36 hrs at 37 °C respectively. To understand the interactions of caveolin- 1, cholesterol and nitric oxide synthases in the hypoxic SK-N-MC cells, the cells were treated with different reagents to change the contents of NO and cholesterol. Results: The expression of caveolin- 1 mRNA and protein was transiently upregulated by 15 hrs of hypoxia but downregulated by 24 hrs or longer exposure to hypoxia, whereas the expression of caveolin- 2 mRNA down-regulated by hypoxia. In normoxic SK-N-MC cells, both S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP, NO donor) and 3 -morpholinosydnonimine (SIN- 1, peroxynitrite donor) up-regulated the expression of caveolin- 1. Moreover, in the SK-N-MC cells exposed to 15 hrs of hypoxia, pretreatments of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a non-selective NOS inhibitor), 1400 W (a inducible NOS inhibitor) or FeTMPyP (a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst) attenuated the increase of caveolin- 1 expression, but there were no obvious changes in the expression of caveolin- 1 by incubation of 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI, a selective neural NOS inhibitor) and l-N 5 -(1 -iminoethyl) -ornithine (L-NIO, a selective endothelial NOS inhibitor). Meanwhile, hypoxia treatment induced intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Pretreatments of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-cholesterol (MCD-CHOL) and oleic acid inhibited and enhanced the expression of caveolin- 1 respectively. Those results suggest that the upregulation of caveolin- 1 could be associated with iNOS-induced reactive nitrogen species production and lipid accumulation in the hypoxic neural cells. Furthermore, we compared the expression of eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS and NO production in wild-type and caveolin- 1 over-expressed SK-N-MC cells after 15 hrs of hypoxia treatment. Exposure to 15 hrs of hypoxia inhibited eNOS expression but induced iNOS expression and NO production in the wild-type cells. However, over-expression of caveolin- 1 prevented the loss of eNOS but downregulated the expression of iNOS and inhibited NO production. Conclusion: The results suggest that augmentation of caveolin- 1 in response to hypoxia stimulation could be a physiological regulating mechanism to inhibit iNOS-induced NO production. Overall, the complex interactions of reactive nitrogen species and caveolin- 1 could be an important signal pathway in the modulation of NO production in hypoxic neural cells.
