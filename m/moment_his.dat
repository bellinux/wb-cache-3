25|$|Between {{his move}} from Revista Nouă to Junimea, Bassarabescu had enlisted at the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the University of Bucharest (graduated 1897), while also {{working as a}} Finance Ministry clerk. At around that time, he had moved to Ploiești city, Prahova, where he would live {{for most of his}} life, and became a teacher of {{geography}} and French. Various sources have it that his relocation occurred in 1896 or 1897, but, according to literary historian George Călinescu, Bassarabescu had spent 1898 working as a substitute teacher in Focșani. Around that <b>moment,</b> <b>his</b> work appeared in the review Noutatea, put out in Iași by Berman Goldner-Giordano.|$|E
25|$|Mobutu found {{discipline}} in army life, {{as well as}} a father figure in Sergeant Louis Bobozo. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare <b>moment.</b> <b>His</b> favorites were the writings of French President Charles de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli. After passing a course in accounting, he began to dabble professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.|$|E

500|$|Somerset's {{appointment}} was {{in keeping with}} historical precedent, and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. In March 1547, he secured letters patent from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. In the words of historian Geoffrey Elton, [...] "from that <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> autocratic system was complete". He proceeded to rule largely by proclamation, calling on the Privy Council to {{do little more than}} rubber-stamp his decisions.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{commonly}} appears nude in the show, {{although in}} every case only his buttocks are visible. In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Bart appears in a sequence where he is skateboarding while fully nude; several different items cover his genitalia, but for a brief <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> penis can be seen. The scene {{was one of the}} first worked on for the film, but the producers were nervous about the segment because they thought it would earn the movie an R rating. Despite this, the film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "Irreverent Humor Throughout." [...] The scene was later included by Entertainment Weekly in their list of [...] "30 Unforgettable Nude Scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 June 1914, {{one person}} was killed and 20 were injured in a {{collision}} and subsequent derailment at Cannon Street. A train departing for [...] was in a side-long collision with a train arriving, across its path, from [...] and, although the collision occurred at low speed, part of the Plumstead service was derailed {{and one of its}} carriages overturned. The driver of the Plumstead service was blamed for a failure to observe, and a misreading of, signals which took his train into the path of the Hastings-bound service. An investigation found the man who died was likely leaning out of the window at the <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> carriage overturned, and he might have avoided serious injury had he been seated.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is viewed}} by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the {{observation}} room, which contains a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switch marked [...] "Live" [...] and [...] "Die". Pamela awakens in another cage {{on the other side}} of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. The <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> voice is unscrambled, Hoffman attacks and kills everyone in the room, learning from Perez that [...] "everyone" [...] in the law enforcement may know of his implication in the games. [...] He plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Meyers {{writes that}} Hemingway {{was very clear}} about the husband's role, because in this story he was writing about a {{familiar}} subject—the experiences of his boyhood in Michigan. The young father's role is to [...] "deflate the doctor", who finds victory in slicing open the woman's belly to deliver the infant, {{and to provide a}} counterpoint to the mother's strength and resilience. The father's suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of the white doctor whose skill is necessary, but who brings with him destruction. In her paper [...] "Screaming Through Silence: The Violence of Race in 'Indian Camp'", Amy Strong writes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] is about domination; the husband kills himself at the <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> wife is cut open by a white doctor. She thinks the theme of domination exists on more than one level: Nick is dominated by his father; the white outsiders dominate in the Indian camp; and the white doctor [...] "has cut into the woman, like the early settlers leaving a gash in the tree." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "The War of the Simpsons" [...] finished fortieth {{in the ratings}} for the week of April 29 to May 5, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 11.6, equivalent to approximately 10.8 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the twelfth best episode of the show with a sports theme (sport fishing). The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the Homer vs. Marge plot was [...] "good on its own", {{but it was also}} [...] "Grampa's big <b>moment.</b> <b>His</b> final revelation to Bart and Lisa is inspired." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the main concern with the episode [...] "stemmed from its start. The scenes at the party were so terrific that the episode could have tanked after that. Happily, it didn’t, as the show provided a consistently high level of entertainment. Between Homer’s excesses at marriage camp and the kids’ antics while Grampa watches them, the program packed in a ton of great gags." ...|$|E

500|$|Amid the {{political}} pressure, George {{was on his}} deathbed, suffering from severe asthma and dropsy. He died at 1:30p.m. on 28 October 1708 at Kensington Palace. The Queen was devastated. James Brydges wrote to General Cadogan, [...] "His death has flung the Queen into an unspeakable grief. She never left him till he was dead, but continued kissing him the very <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> breath {{went out of his}} body, and 'twas {{with a great deal of}} difficulty my Lady Marlborough prevailed upon her to leave him." [...] Anne wrote to her nephew, Frederick IV of Denmark, [...] "the loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for me to be able to bear it as I ought." [...] Anne was desperate to stay at Kensington with the body of her husband, but under pressure from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James's Palace. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural [...] "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead". Anne and the Duchess had been very close, but their friendship had become strained over political differences. The immediate aftermath of George's death damaged their relationship further. He was buried privately at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
500|$|The table below lists Ottoman sultans, {{as well as}} {{the last}} Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or {{signatures}} used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The [...] "Notes" [...] column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the <b>moment</b> <b>his</b> successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as [...] "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor. In 1617, the law of succession changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( [...] ekberiyet), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.|$|E

His leg, although shortened and withered, recovered enough for him to make a century at Lancing in 1917.
