This {{is not the same as}} blocking the thyroid's release of thyroid hormone, for which the adult dose is different (and is actually higher by a factor of 7 or 8), and for which KI anti-radiation pills (not a common medical treatment form of KI) are not usually available in pharmacies, or normally used in hospitals, or by physicians. Although the two forms of potassium iodide are completely interchangeable, normally in practice the SSKI solution, which is the historical <b>medical</b> <b>form</b> of high dose iodine, is generally used for all medical purposes save for radioiodine prophylaxis. For protection of the thyroid against radioiodine (iodine-131) contamination, the convenient standard 130mg KI pill is used, if available. As noted, the equivalent two drops of SSKI (equaling the dose of one KI pill) may be used for this purpose, if the pills are not available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Medical</b> <b>forms</b> are {{frequently}} used to document patient data or to collect relevant data for clinical trials. It {{is crucial to}} harmonize <b>medical</b> <b>forms</b> {{in order to improve}} interoperability and data integration between medical applications. Here we propose a (semi-) automatic an-notation of <b>medical</b> <b>forms</b> with concepts of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our annotation workflow encompasses a novel seman-tic blocking, sophisticated match techniques and post-processing steps to select reasonable annotations. We evaluate our methods based on refer-ence mappings between <b>medical</b> <b>forms</b> and UMLS, and further manually validate the recommended annotations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>forms</b> {{are very}} heterogeneous: on a European scale there are {{thousands}} of data items in several hundred different systems. To enable data exchange for clinical care and research purposes {{there is a need to}} develop interoperable documentation systems with harmonized forms for data capture. A prerequisite in this harmonization process is comparison of forms. So far – to our knowledge – an automated method for comparison of <b>medical</b> <b>forms</b> is not available. A form contains a list of data items with corresponding medical concepts. An automatic comparison needs data types, item names and especially item with these unique concept codes from medical terminologies. The scope of the proposed method is a comparison of these items by comparing their concept codes (coded in UMLS). Each data item is represented by item name, concept code and value domain. Two items are called identical, if item name, concept code and value domain are the same. Two items are called matching, if only concept code and value domain are the same. Two items are called similar, if their concept codes are the same, but the value domains are different. Based on these definitions an open-source implementation for automated comparison of <b>medical</b> <b>forms</b> in ODM format with UMLS-based semantic annotations was developed. It is available as package compareODM fro...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{simplest}} form of the Zodiac Man can be dated back to originate with the ancient Babylonians, while the Mayans and Egyptians had analogues as well. Hebrew, Chinese, Vedic, and ancient Mithraic cultures also shared similar concepts of the man being seen as a microcosm. Besides medical purposes, the stars influenced many things in medieval history, such as agriculture, weather, even personality traits. It was no shock that the stars’ movements also helped in diagnosing illnesses or deciding when a medical procedure would be taking place. In the 12th and 13th centuries ancient astrological studies were translated from Arabic to Latin and soon enough even became {{required by law to}} calculate the moon’s position before performing any sort of medical procedure. It was {{in the second half of}} the 16th century when the belief in astrology in its <b>medical</b> <b>form</b> was at its peak in England to everyone including all of its society. Almanacs and many other print forms of astrology were in high demand at this time due to astrology’s sudden popularity. Most believed that knowledge of the moon and astrology was absolutely essential. Although the 17th century was the beginning of the very gradual downfall of scientific belief of the Zodiac Man, the idea of it was popular for very long after the Middle Ages.|$|E
