5|$|<b>Metformin</b> has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The <b>metformin</b> pKa values make <b>metformin</b> a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of <b>metformin</b> through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of <b>metformin</b> is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on <b>metformin</b> impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of <b>metformin</b> are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than <b>metformin.</b>|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as <b>metformin</b> administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of <b>metformin</b> do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of <b>metformin</b> in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Broad {{interest}} in <b>metformin</b> was not rekindled until {{the withdrawal of}} the other biguanides in the 1970s. <b>Metformin</b> was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of <b>metformin</b> to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on March 3, 1995. Generic formulations are now available in several countries, and <b>metformin</b> is believed to have become the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug.|$|E
5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of <b>metformin</b> and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of <b>metformin</b> were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. <b>Metformin</b> should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended <b>metformin</b> unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found <b>metformin</b> improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with <b>metformin</b> {{administration}} because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} <b>metformin</b> inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of <b>metformin</b> and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because <b>metformin</b> decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} to counteract the weight gain caused by antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with <b>metformin,</b> primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release <b>metformin</b> and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of <b>metformin</b> is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> is not metabolized. It is cleared {{from the}} body by tubular {{secretion}} and excreted unchanged in the urine; <b>metformin</b> is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. <b>Metformin</b> is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics).|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> is {{recommended}} to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or angiogram), as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of <b>metformin</b> in the body. <b>Metformin</b> can be resumed after two days, assuming kidney function is normal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> is safe in {{pregnancy}} {{and women with}} gestational diabetes treated with <b>metformin</b> have less weight gain during pregnancy than those treated with insulin. Babies born to women treated with <b>metformin</b> {{have been found to}} develop less visceral fat, making them less prone to insulin resistance in later life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade name Glucophage among others, is the {{first-line}} medication {{for the treatment}} of type 2 diabetes, After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given <b>metformin.</b> It is unclear whether <b>metformin</b> slowed down the progression of prediabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).|$|E
5|$|Research {{is ongoing}} {{on the use}} of <b>metformin,</b> a {{diabetes}} medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that preoperative <b>metformin</b> administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of <b>metformin</b> has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observational}} {{studies and}} randomized, controlled trials found <b>metformin</b> {{to be as}} effective and safe as insulin {{for the management of}} gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns were raised and evidence on the long-term safety of <b>metformin</b> for both mother and child is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of <b>metformin,</b> by reducing clearance of <b>metformin</b> by the kidneys; both <b>metformin</b> and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase <b>metformin</b> concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of <b>metformin</b> is {{gastrointestinal}} irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence; <b>metformin</b> is more {{commonly associated with}} gastrointestinal side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs. The most serious potential side effect of <b>metformin</b> use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, {{and the vast majority}} of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the <b>metformin</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. <b>Metformin</b> is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of <b>metformin</b> was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, <b>metformin</b> increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. <b>Metformin</b> and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. <b>Metformin</b> also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of <b>metformin</b> in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given <b>metformin</b> for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with <b>metformin</b> performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend <b>metformin</b> as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|DPP-4 inhibitors {{combined}} with <b>metformin</b> include a sitagliptin/metformin combination and a saxagliptin combination (Komboglyze), and with alogliptin as Kazano among others.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe {{discomfort}}; {{it is most}} common when <b>metformin</b> is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate <b>metformin.</b> Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Canada, and {{elsewhere}} <b>metformin</b> combined with linagliptin is marketed under the trade name Jentadueto.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, <b>metformin</b> increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after <b>metformin</b> treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|Liquid <b>metformin</b> is {{sold under}} the name Riomet in India. Each 5ml of Riomet is {{equivalent}} to the 500-mg tablet form.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> {{decreases}} {{high blood}} sugar, primarily by suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; <b>metformin</b> treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of <b>metformin</b> is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with <b>metformin.</b> A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested <b>metformin</b> is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma <b>metformin</b> concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 1–4mg/l in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120mg/l in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200mg/l in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> {{may reduce}} insulin {{requirement}} in type 1 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of <b>metformin</b> and pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor) remains available in U.S. and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of <b>metformin</b> with pioglitazone and glibenclamide {{is available in}} India as Triformin.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{synthesis}} of <b>metformin,</b> originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine over heat.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} <b>metformin</b> overdoses {{reported}} to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of <b>metformin</b> have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|Aging (C.elegans and crickets). A 2017 {{review and}} {{meta-analysis}} {{found that people}} with diabetes who were taking <b>metformin</b> had significantly lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease than those on other therapies.|$|E
5|$|In a {{clinical}} trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 given immediate-release <b>metformin</b> (as opposed to placebo) reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> became {{available}} in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metformin</b> {{has also}} been {{reported}} to decrease the blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in people with hypothyroidism. The significance of this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Sulfonylureas act by {{increasing}} insulin {{release from the}} beta cells in the pancreas. <b>Metformin</b> is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular).|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} type 2 diabetes, <b>metformin</b> is often {{prescribed}} {{in combination with}} other drugs. Several are available as fixed-dose combinations, to reduce pill burden and simplify administration.|$|E
