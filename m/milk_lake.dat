This retreat has occurred during a period of reduced winter snowfall and higher summer temperatures. In this region of the Cascades, winter snowpack has declined 25% since 1946, and summer temperatures have risen 0.7°C (1.2°F) during the same period. The reduced snowpack has occurred despite a small increase in winter precipitation—thus, it reflects warmer winter temperatures leading to rainfall and melting on glaciers even during the winter. As of 2005, 67% of the North Cascade glaciers observed are in disequilibrium and will not survive the continuation of the present climate. These glaciers will eventually disappear unless temperatures fall and frozen precipitation increases. The remaining glaciers are expected to stabilize, unless the climate continues to warm, but will be much reduced in size.|$|E

50|$|It {{is located}} {{in the eastern part of}} the Texel Group. Eight to ten lakes of {{significant}} size such as the Grünsee (Green Lake), the Langsee (Long Lake), the two Milchseen (<b>Milk</b> <b>Lakes)</b> or the small Mückensee (Midge Lake) occupy a total area of 30 hectares. However, only the Kaser Lacke, the Pfitscher Lacke, the Mückenlacke (Midge Pond), the Grünsee (Green Lake), the Schwarzsee (Black Lake), the Schiefersee (Slate Lake), and the Kesselsee (Kettle Lake) belong officially to this group of lakes. They were eroded by glaciers on a relatively limited area at altitudes from 2117 to 2598 m or left behind in the rocks of the ancient gneises, granite gneisses, and mica schists. The largest body of water is the Langsee (2.377 m) which is alive with salvelinus. A particularly good view can be obtained from the summit of Spronser Rötelspitze (2.625 m). The owner of Auer Castle in the village Tirol has the fishing right in the Langsee.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that simple price {{limiters}} may have unexpected consequences in irregular commodity price fluctuations between bull and bear markets and complicated impacts {{on the size of}} buffer stocks. In particular, imposing a lower price boundary may lead to a huge buffer stock, e. g. to a ?butter mountain? or a ?<b>milk</b> <b>lake?</b> and this is a real problem for regulators since storage costs may become impossible to finance over time. The relation between price limiters and the size of buffer stocks is nontrivial and there may exist some optimal price limiters which require only weak market interventions and thus provide a rather inexpensive option to regulate commodity markets. In this paper, we use a simple commodity market model to explore the relation between price limiters and the average growth rate of the buffer stocks. It is found that these optimal price limiter levels are simply the minimum values of unstable periodic orbits of the underlying deterministic system. commodity markets; price stabilization; limiter control; butter mountains and milk lakes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this study}} was to {{document}} if lakes in National Parks in Washington have exceeded critical levels of nitrogen (N) deposition, as observed in other Western States. We measured atmospheric N de-position, lake water quality, and sediment diatoms at our study lakes. Water chemistry showed that our study lakes were ultra-oligotrophic with ammonia and nitrate concentrations often at or below detection limits with low specific conductance (< 100 μS/cm), and acid neu-tralizing capacities (< 400 μeq/L). Rates of summer bulk inorganic N deposition at all our sites ranged from 0. 6 to 2. 4 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 and were variable both within and across the parks. Diatom assemblages in a single sedi-ment core from Hoh Lake (Olympic National Park) displayed a shift to increased relative abundances of Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria tenera beginning in the 1969 – 1975 timeframe, whereas these species were not found at the remaining (nine) sites. These diatom species are known to be indicative of N enrich-ment and were used to determine an empirical critical load of N deposition, or threshold level, where changes in diatom communities were observed at Hoh Lake. However, N deposition at the remaining nine lakes does not seem to exceed a critical load at this time. At <b>Milk</b> <b>Lake,</b> also in Olympic National Park, there was some evidence that climate change might be altering diatom communities, but more research is needed to confirm this. We used modeled precipitation for Hoh Lake and annual inorganic N concentrations from a nearby National Atmospheric Deposition Program station, to calculate elevation-corrected N deposition for 1980 – 2009 at Hoh Lake. An exponential fit to this data was hindcasted to the 1969 – 1975 time period, and we esti-mate a critical load of 1. 0 to 1. 2 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 for wet deposition for this lake...|$|E
