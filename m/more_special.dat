5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it <b>more</b> <b>special</b> in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|The Huskies {{found their}} rhythm during the NCAA Tournament, {{in which they}} were a #2 seed; in the Elite Eight they beat top-seeded Penn State to advance to the Final Four at the New Orleans Arena. After beating Minnesota in the semifinals, UConn again {{defeated}} Tennessee for the National Championship. The win was even <b>more</b> <b>special</b> as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014.|$|E

5|$|With {{two games}} remaining, Yorke scored his 29th {{goal of the}} season at Middlesbrough to help his team return {{to the top of}} the table. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's late winner against Arsenal two days later all but ended Wenger’s chances of {{retaining}} the league championship. United now needed only four points, one of them gained at Ewood Park, relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process. Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day, coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2–1. The achievement was all the <b>more</b> <b>special</b> for Ferguson, who lifted his fifth domestic championship in seven seasons.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are <b>more</b> <b>special</b> abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought <b>more</b> <b>Special</b> Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E

5000|$|Byers joined The Specials {{when the}} band was called The Coventry Automatics and wrote several songs for the band. The most {{successful}} was [...] "Rat Race", which peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart in May 1980.

25|$|Lidström was an {{alternate}} {{captain of the}} Red Wings since the 1997–98 season, but was awarded the captaincy after the 2006 retirement of long-time Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman. It was an honour made <b>more</b> <b>special</b> {{by the fact that}} he became the first European captain in franchise history. In his first year of captaincy, Lidström led the Red Wings to the Western Conference Finals, but lost to eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Anaheim Ducks. In the off-season, Lidström joined an elite group by capturing the Norris Trophy as the League's outstanding defenceman for the fifth time. Lidström became the fourth defenceman in NHL history with as many as five Norris Trophy wins, joining Hockey Hall of Famers Bobby Orr (eight), Doug Harvey (seven) and Ray Bourque (five).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking <b>more</b> <b>special</b> interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

25|$|Clark {{later was}} the hostess of two <b>more</b> <b>specials,</b> another one for NBC {{and one for}} ABC—one which served as a pilot for a {{projected}} weekly series.

Clark starred in the BBC television series This is Petula Clark, which aired from mid-1966 to early 1968.|$|R
25|$|The {{season was}} {{made all the}} <b>more</b> <b>special</b> {{following}} Shawn Redhage's announcement that the 2016/17 season {{would be his last}} in the NBL. When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals {{for the first time in}} 31 years seemed like a real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name—380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)—while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and <b>more</b> <b>special</b> than any other neighbouring city.|$|E
500|$|Director Paul Lynch {{compared}} the production on [...] "Q-Less" [...] to a typical TNG episode. [...] On DS9, the shots were {{more complex and}} generally featured <b>more</b> <b>special</b> effects. Lynch said that the scene which showed Q seamlessly teleporting himself from one chair to another, changing his costume as he went, was particularly difficult. [...] The producers, particularly Rick Berman, were determined for DS9 {{to be the best}} that it could be, notes Lynch. The comedic elements of the episode required precise timing, with Lynch comparing it to the television series Moonlighting.|$|E
5000|$|Dakar also {{collaborated with}} The Specials. Her duet with Terry Hall, [...] "I Can't Stand It", {{appeared}} on the album, <b>More</b> <b>Specials.</b> After The Specials announced their break up in 1981, Jerry Dammers formed a new band called The Special AKA, along with Dakar and John Bradbury. Their first single release, [...] "The Boiler" [...] reached # 35 in the UK Singles Chart in 1982.|$|R
50|$|<b>More</b> <b>Specials</b> is {{the second}} album by ska band the Specials, {{released}} in October 1980.

The lyrics, like the previous album, were often intensely political.|$|R
