40|$|We {{address the}} problem of jamming-resistant {{broadcast}} communications under an internal threat model. We propose a time-delayed broadcast scheme (TDBS), which implements the broadcast operation as a series of unicast transmissions distributed in frequency and time. TDBS does not rely on commonly shared secrets, or the existence of jamming-immune control channels for coordinating broadcasts. Instead, each node follows a unique pseudo-noise (PN) frequency hopping sequence. Contrary to conventional PN sequences designed for <b>multi-access</b> <b>systems,</b> the PN sequences in TDBS exhibit correlation to enable broadcast. Moreover, they are designed to limit the information leakage due to the exposure of a subset of sequences by compromised nodes. We map the problem of constructing such PN sequences to the 1 -factorization problem for complete graphs. We further accommodate dynamic broadcast groups by mapping the problem of updating the assigned PN sequences to the problem of constructing rainbow paths in proper edge-colored graphs...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{of service}} (QoS) for a network is {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} various parameters specifying packet delay and loss tolerance requirements for the application. The unpredictable nature of the wireless channel demands for application of certain mechanisms to meet the QoS requirements. Traditionally, medium access control (MAC) and network layers perform these tasks. However, these mechanisms do not take (fading) channel conditions into account. In this paper, we investigate the problem using cross layer techniques where information flow and joint optimization of higher and physical layer is permitted. We propose a scheduling scheme to optimize the energy consumption of a multiuser <b>multi-access</b> <b>system</b> such that QoS constraints in terms of packet loss are fulfilled while the system is able to maximize the advantages emerging from multiuser diversity. Specifically, this work focuses on modeling and analyzing the effects of packet buffering capabilities of the transmitter on the system energy for a packet loss tolerant application.

The numerical evaluation reveals useful insights about the coupling effects of different QoS parameters on the system energy consumption and validates our analytical results. © 2002 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{incorporating}} user deployed local area networks with wide area networks {{to create an}} interoperable multi-access environment has been gaining popularity. For the case where this multi-access environment is managed by multiple entities, quality of service (QoS) remains guaranteed {{as long as the}} different operators cooperate and agree upon centralized radio resource management (RRM) schemes. For the environment where centralized RRM techniques can not be applied {{due to the lack of}} coordination between different operators, word of mouth (WoM) circulation appears to be a promising solution for providing guaranteed QoS. WoM circulation involves exchange of reputation grades about the QoS of localized networks among roaming users in a terminal to terminal fashion. But this kind of decentralized distribution of reputation grades may turn into a potential threat to the energy and memory reserves of the user equipment. To study the energy consumption involving WoM transfer between the roaming users, a <b>multi-access</b> <b>system</b> is simulated which has full coverage from the cellular network and only has partial coverage from a single access point (AP).

At each slot, each user transmits (is active) with a certain probability, independently of other users, and is heard by all base stations within the distance r. Both the users and base stations are placed uniformly at random over the (unit) area. We first consider a non-cooperative decoding where base stations work in isolation, but a user is decoded {{as soon as one}} of its nearby base stations reads a clean signal from it. We find the de-coding probability and quantify the gains introduced by multiple base stations. Specifically, the peak throughput increases linearly with the number of base stations m and is roughly m/ 4 larger than the throughput of a single-base station that uses standard slotted Aloha. Next, we propose a cooperative decoding, where the mutually close base stations inform each other whenever they decode a user inside their coverage overlap.

Compatible <b>multi-access</b> <b>system</b> should provide the means to control (i. e. admission congestion) the flow of traffic and at the same time maintain the QoS requirements. The essence of this work is to introduce an interaction between the physical layer and higher network layers, thus enabling more practical utilization of multi-user detection and supporting services with different QoS parameters. The traffic sources are classified according to their activities and QoS of parameters into two categories, namely stream and interactive traffic. As congestion arises, the interactive traffic users are granted higher priority than the stream traffic users. In this work, a new hybrid Multicode (MC) -CDMA/TDMA medium access control technique utilizing multi-user detection accompanied with a traffic flow control scheme is proposed and analyzed. Secondly, the End-to-End performance criteria of the proposed MAC such as packet delay, channel utilization, etc. are investigated under new Window Measurement-Based admission/congestion control policy where the status of the buffer at the base station is estimated taking into consideration the physical limitations of the base station (i. e. the number of transmission and reception moderns), call and burst level traffic, channel impairment, etc. Thirdly, the hybrid analysis/simulation routine is repeated to investigate and verify the performance of the above proposed MAC along with several versions of congestion policies. The whole system is studied under wide range of traffic load, and different system parameters.

40|$|Two {{expected}} {{characteristics of}} future wireless networks aresupport for multiple bearer services, {{which in turn}} enablemultiple end-user services, and the parallel use of multipleradio access technologies. This dissertation discusses radioresource management principles to improve capacity for suchmulti-bearer service, multi-access networks. More specifically, it is first focused on how to mostefficiently share the radio resource between bearer servicegroups within one access technology. A general principle forsharing resources in interference limited systems is proposed,and its expected performance estimated. The proposedinterference balancing principle maximizes capacity byadjusting the power budgets per bearer service group so thatthe maximum tolerable interference levels are equal for allbearer services. To verify its validity, the interferencebalancing principle {{is applied to the}} 3 rd generation cellularsystems GSM/EDGE and WCDMA in a set of multi-bearer servicecase studies. It is seen that interference balancing maystraightforwardly be introduced in these systems, and thatsignificant capacity gains over non-balanced scenarios can beachieved. Secondly, how to best share traffic load between thedifferent sub-systems in a multi-access scenario isinvestigated. The capability to handle bearer services, andthereby also end-user services, typically differs betweensub-systems. The overall <b>multi-access</b> <b>system</b> capacity istherefore affected by the allocation of bearer services on tosub-systems. Based on this, a simple principle for findingfavorable, under certain constraints near-optimum, sub-systembearer service allocations is derived. It is seen that for agiven service mix combined capacities beyond the sum of thesub-system capacities may be achieved by using the favorablebearer service allocations. Significant capacity gains are alsoseen in a case study in which the bearer service allocationprinciple is applied to a combined GSM/EDGE and WCDMAmulti-access system. The bearer service type may be said toreflect an expected radio resource cost for supporting a userin each sub-system. By taking into account the actual radioresource cost, which may differ from the expected cost, whenassigning users to subsystems, further capacity gains areachievable. NR 2014080...|$|E
