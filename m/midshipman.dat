5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of <b>midshipman</b> existed: <b>midshipman</b> (original rating), <b>midshipman</b> extraordinary, <b>midshipman</b> (apprentice officer), and <b>midshipman</b> ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer {{candidates}} who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E
5|$|Today, ranks {{equivalent}} to <b>midshipman</b> exist in many countries. Using U.S. <b>midshipman</b> or pre-fleet board UK <b>midshipman</b> {{as the basis}} for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK <b>midshipman</b> for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a U.S. ensign in role and responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1677, Royal Navy {{regulations}} for promotion to lieutenant required {{service as a}} <b>midshipman,</b> and promotion to <b>midshipman</b> required some time at sea. By the Napoleonic era, the regulations required {{at least three years}} of services as a <b>midshipman</b> or master's mate and six years of total sea time. Sea time was earned in various ways, most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating, either as a servant of one of the ship's officers, a volunteer, or a seaman.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} mentoring and <b>midshipmen</b> at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). The {{mission of the}} Naval Academy is essentially to develop leaders, and mentoring {{is closely related to}} leadership. Therefore, this study looked at possible correlations between mentoring and <b>midshipmen</b> at USNA. Specifically, the extent of mentoring on <b>midshipmen</b> at USNA, the degree of influence mentors had on <b>midshipmen,</b> salient features of USNA mentors, and other psychosocial outcomes of mentoring on <b>midshipmen</b> were investigated in this study. This study suggests <b>midshipmen</b> generally accept mentoring as an important concept, but only 45 % of USNA <b>midshipmen</b> have mentors. Female <b>midshipmen</b> {{were more likely to have}} a mentor at USNA than their male counterparts. USNA mentors were typically older than their protege, Caucasian, male and in the military. Peers were most trusted and utilized as mentors. This study also suggests that <b>midshipmen</b> having mentors were more satisfied with USNA, more likely to mentor others, and more likely to hold a leadership position on a sports team or in an extracurricular activity (ECA...|$|R

5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the <b>midshipman</b> a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a <b>midshipman</b> in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed <b>midshipman</b> would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the <b>midshipman</b> would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{utilized}} a multi-method {{approach to}} conduct exploratory research {{regarding the use}} and abuse of alcohol by <b>midshipmen</b> at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). Quantitative data were analyzed regarding <b>midshipmen</b> perceptions of abuse. Over 50 % of <b>midshipmen</b> consider alcohol abuse as a problem at the Academy. Focus groups were conducted in order to gather qualitative data concerning <b>midshipmen</b> drinking behaviors. <b>Midshipmen</b> representing all four classes at USNA reported significant pressures not only to drink underage but to binge drink. The probability of binge drinking at USNA {{may be related to}} the fact that <b>midshipmen</b> are restricted in their use of alcohol; there exists an attitude that they need to make up for lost time by over-indulging when they do have the opportunity. Sixty-five percent of the female and 77 % of the male <b>midshipmen</b> participants admitted binge drinking within the last six months (significantly higher than the national college average of 44 %). Fear of jeopardizing future careers prevents <b>midshipmen</b> from getting the medical assistance they need for alcohol poisoning or concerns about alcohol dependency. Recommendations include "playing down" the novelty of drinking, providing more opportunities for responsible use, establishing alternate avenues for reporting <b>midshipmen</b> for medical help, holding the 1 /c <b>midshipmen</b> accountable for modeling responsible alcohol use, and continuing to support the ADEO program and prevention education.

5|$|In the 17th century, a <b>midshipman</b> was {{a rating}} for an {{experienced}} seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a <b>midshipman,</b> and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a <b>midshipman</b> was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a <b>midshipman</b> or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to <b>midshipman</b> in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a <b>midshipman</b> was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E
