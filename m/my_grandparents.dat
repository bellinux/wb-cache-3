Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what <b>my</b> <b>grandparents</b> had to go through, not just <b>my</b> <b>grandparents</b> but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful."

500|$|At age six Starkey {{developed}} appendicitis. Following {{a routine}} appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, {{causing him to}} fall into a coma that lasted for days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff {{made an effort to}} stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song [...] "Bedtime for Drums" [...] as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: [...] "I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... <b>My</b> <b>grandparents</b> gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing.

2500|$|Kahlo's {{paintings}} often feature root imagery {{with roots}} {{growing out of}} her body to tie her to the ground, reflecting in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and finally in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for either good and/or ill. In <b>My</b> <b>Grandparents</b> and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth, and her own sense of unity with Mexico itself. In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations. Additionally, hair features {{as a symbol of}} growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off. Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her and/or a threat to harm her own body just like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves. Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors serve as a symbol of a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to [...] "cut up" [...] women, both metaphorically and literally. In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, and as a woman, Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.|$|E

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} deployment and usage of gigabit networks, traditional network anomaly detection based intrusion detection systems have not scaled accordingly. Most, if not all, systems deployed assume {{the availability of}} complete and clean data {{for the purpose of}} intrusion detection. We contend that this assumption is not valid. Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes, and the large amount of data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, the leitmotif of the research effort described in this dissertation is the design of a novel intrusion detection system that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when complete audit data is not available. In this dissertation, we take a holistic approach to anomaly detection to address the threats posed by network based denial-of-service attacks by proposing improvements in every step of the intrusion detection process. At the data collection phase, we have implemented an adaptive sam-pling scheme that intelligently samples incoming network data to reduce the volume of traffic sampled, while maintaining the intrinsic characteristics of the network traffic. A Bloom filters based fast flow aggregation scheme is employed at the data pre-processing stage to further reduce the response time of the anomaly detection scheme. Lastly, this dissertation also proposes an expectation-maximization algorithm based anomaly detec-tion scheme that uses the sampled audit data to detect intrusions in the incoming network traffic. ii In loving memory of <b>my</b> <b>grandparent...</b>|$|R
40|$|USDA {{programs}} {{available to}} private landowners {{can play a}} role in preventing wildlife declines through land use change. In the Fall of 2006 through a family decision, with the goal of improving wildlife on <b>my</b> <b>grandparent’s</b> 60 acre farm located in Switzerland County, Indiana, two contracts were signed, one being a WHIP contract and the other being a CP- 33 contract both funded by the USDA. Both contracts involved planting native, warm season grasses with different seed mixtures and rates on two adjacent sites with one being a pasture landscape (WHIP) and a crop field (CP- 33). The WHIP contract also included a shrub or tree planting component on two types of sites: a wetland site and other areas throughout the pasture. For both contracts, everything was completed in the Spring of 2007 following Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) guidelines, along with an Indiana Wildlife Biologist's plan for the farm. Since the completion of the contracts, additional shrub planting has occurred every year up to the Spring of 2010. Since the establishment phase of these two contracts, my family started the mid-contract management aspect in the Spring of 2010 outlined in both contracts by the NRCS and Biologist's plan and will continue this practice in the Spring of 2011.

Then one day at dinner my great-uncle William Middleton says, [...] "we should not make light of the troubles of children. They are worse than ours, because we can see the end of our trouble and they can never see any end," [...] and I feel grateful for I know that I am very unhappy and have often said to myself, [...] "when you grow up, never talk as grown-up people do of the happiness of childhood." [...] I may have already had the night of misery when, having prayed for several days that I might die, I had begun to be afraid that I was dying and prayed that I might live. There was no reason for my unhappiness. Nobody was unkind, and my grandmother has still after so many years my gratitude and my reverence. The house was so big that there was always a room to hide in, and I had a red pony and a garden where I could wander, and there were two dogs to follow at my heels, one white with some black spots on his head and the other with long black hair all over him. I used to think about God and fancy that I was very wicked, and one day when I threw a stone and hit a duck in the yard by mischance and broke its wing, I was full of wonder when I was told that the duck would be cooked for dinner and that I should not be punished.|$|E
60|$|My father was, from my {{earliest}} recollection, in comfortable circumstances, considering the times, his place of residence, {{and the community}} in which he lived. Mindful of his own lack of facilities for acquiring an education, his greatest desire in maturer years was {{for the education of}} his children. Consequently, as stated before, I never missed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attend till the time of leaving home. This did not exempt me from labor. In my early days, every one labored more or less, in the region where my youth was spent, and more in proportion to their private means. It was only the very poor who were exempt. While my father carried on the manufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned and tilled considerable land. I detested the trade, preferring almost any other labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment in which horses were used. We had, among other lands, fifty acres of forest within a mile of the village. In the fall of the year choppers were employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month. When I was seven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in the house and shops. I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at that time, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one at the house unload. When about eleven years old, I was strong enough to hold a plough. From that age until seventeen I did all the work done with horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn and potatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood, besides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood for stoves, etc., while still attending school. For this I was compensated by {{the fact that there was}} never any scolding or punishing by my parents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting <b>my</b> <b>grandparents</b> in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on the ice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground.|$|E
