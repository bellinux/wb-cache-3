However, the minimum total gap that an MEJ needs to avoid pounding is not well investigated. To provide guidance for the seismic gap of MEJs, the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> of adjacent bridge segments subject to strong earthquakes was studied experimentally. To date, no experimental investigation of excitation spatial variation effect on bridge on natural soil has been reported. This research addressed a bridge with three identical segments of 100 m. A 1 : 22 scale bridge model founded on compacted beach sand was tested using electro-magnetic inertial exciters. Different ground motions were applied to the model to simulate the effect of spatially varying ground motions. Soil-structure interaction (SSI) was studied by comparing the minimum total gaps with those obtained from the fixed-based experiments in the laboratory. The spatially varying ground motions were simulated based on the New Zealand design spectra for soft soil, shallow soil and strong rock conditions using an empirical coherency loss function. SSI was found to reduce the minimum total gap of an MEJ needed to avoid pounding between adjacent segments.

The dominant frequencies due to a passing train are determined for a specific train and speed from a recorded acceleration time-history. Using a simple model of an oscillator, the total energy harvested for the passage of one train is calculated. The stiffness, and hence the tuning frequency of the device, is varied in simulations to determine the optimum frequency at which to tune the device for a constant value of mass and damping in the device.

40|$|Abstract. Studies in the {{structural}} systems include two main approaches, design and analysis, which require response evaluation of structures {{to the external}} loads including live and dead loads. Structures behave statically and dynamically for static and dynamic loads, respectively. One {{of the most important}} dynamic loads acting on a structure is earthquake force. In order to find responses of structures subjected to earthquake, several schemes of direct integration can be used. This study deals with two methods of calculating dynamic responses of a single-degree of freedom oscillator, i. e., central difference method(CDM) and Newmark’s beta method(NBM), using recorded ground acceleration for 60 seconds. The <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> acceleration is obtained to determine <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> by which estimation of quality and quantity of failure occurred to a structure for a given earthquake is provided. Firstly both CDM and NBM are discussed. Second, for a specific damping ratio dynamic responses are evaluated for periods of range in between 0. 1 sec to 1. 5 sec to evaluate the effects of period on responses of system. Third, the effects of damping on dynamic responses of SDOF system are evaluated by considering different damping coefficients from ζ= 0 to 0. 5. The results are compared and discussed to investigate the range of periods and damping factors where methods can provide a better estimation of responses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTanks with {{floating}} roof have shown high vulnerability subjected to past earthquakes, such as Kobe, and Izmit. The {{main cause of}} damage {{is believed to be}} the interaction between the {{floating roof}} and the tank wall. In this paper a simplified method is presented for modeling the floating roof and its interaction with the tank wall, making it possible to use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for calculating the seismic response of tank-floating roof system. In the proposed method, assuming that the sloshing phenomenon is mainly suppressed by the floating roof, the seal between the roof and the tank's wall is modeled by introducing some radial pre-compressed ‘only-compression elements’ all around the roof, itself substituted by a rigid disk, and the tank's wall is modeled by 3 -dimensional shell elements. The dynamic effect of the impounded oil in the tank is taken into account by the use of added mass concept. If during the time history analysis the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> between the roof disk and the tank's wall in any radial direction exceeds the initial length of the pre-compressed only-compression springs the tank is considered to be vulnerable.

40|$|Geodetic {{evidence}} of crustal deformation in the Ionian area detected by GPS surveys {{is given in}} this paper. a network consisting of nine geodetic sites crossing the Ionian sea from Calabria (southern Italy) to northwestern Greece was repeatedly surveyed, starting in 1991, {{within the framework of}} the TYRGEONET project. The results, obtained from processing data from three GPS campaigns performed on the same network in 1991, 1994 and recently in 1995, show significant changes in the positions of five sites. The deformations in terms of displacements (coordinate differences), are obtained by applying a rigorous statistical approach that analyses their significance by an original interactive procedure based on the classical F (Fisher) test. although more substantial geophysical conclusions require more observations, the estimated <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> pattern is generally coherent with the features of the main tectonic structures identified for this area. The detected deformations for the greek sites confirm the activity of the Kefalonia right-lateral transform fault, and a right-lateral motion of the Mattinata fault (northern Apulia) seems to have been detected by the Italian sites. Moreover, within the time span analysed, the site of Matera shows a different behaviour from the three Adriatic sites (Tremiti, M. S. Angelo and Specchia Cristi), since <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> among Matera and these sites were detected. This fact may indicate the weakness of the assumption, reported in some papers, that Matera could be a representative site of the motion of the whole Adriatic plate. Furthermore, the site of Specchia Cristi shows the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> in the network, with a vector magnitude of about 5 cm with a 3 cm confidence interval at the 95 percent level. therefore, even if some additional GPS observations are needed to achieve a clearer picture of the tectonic behaviour of the Ionian Sea area, the detected <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> pattern of the Italian sites agrees with a possible rotational behaviour of the Apulian platform with respect to the Adriatic plate, as already hypothesized by Finetti (1982) ...|$|R

In the theory of shock isolation, mass-spring model has been mostly adopted to describe the shock response of a system. However, since the mass-spring model ignores the deflection of the fragile equipment and the coupling of the equipment with its supports, {{it may not be}} adequate to apply to flexible electronic components such as printed circuit board. In the present paper, a comprehensive study is carried out for both mass-spring systems and flexible beam structures. Particular attention is paid to the maximum force sustained by the connecter, the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> and the vibration amplitude with respect to shock duration. It is found {{that as long as the}} shock duration exceeds 0. 3 times of the basic period. the beam structure can still be simplified as mass-spring model. However, about 10 vibration modes should be considered in order to achieve a good estimation, if the shock duration is much shorter than the natural period. Results show that better cushion effect can be achieved when the shock duration exceeds 2. 5 times of the natural period of the response system. A notable phenomenon found in this research is that the maximum strain is independent of the dimension of the beam. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of obtaining the {{pertinent}} aseismic desigu data of tall elasto-plastic buildingstructures, the earthquake responses {{of a large number}} of bi-linear elasto-plastic, multi-story sheartype structural models having various distributions of stifihess and shear strength at the elasticlimit are analyzed systematically by using an analog computer. The distributions of stiffness and shear strength of standard model are expressed in theform, {~rd={fiJ={l -A(I- l/ss-l) ~} in which ~l and s-' are variable structural parameterscorresponding to the distribution characteristics, I and a denote the number of mass ordered fromthe base to top and the number of the degree-of-freedom of the structural model, respectively. Also, to find the effect of the fluctuation of the strength distribution on the earthquake responses,the models having the irregular distribution of shear strength are considered in this study. On the other hand, the mass distribution is supposed to be uniform over the height. Asregards the damping characteristics, it is assumed that its distribution is identical to the stiffnessdistribution and that each structural model has 2 % critical damping with respect to the funda-mental harmonics. Also it is assumed that the rigidity ratio of the second to the first branch ofthe hi-linear hysteresis 1 oop is uniformly 0. 2 over the bight. As regards earthquake excitations, the five typical wave-shape functions of acceleration recordsof the past strong earthquakes are considered and the time-constant represented by the duration-time is yarned for giving various reference frequencies to the spectral characteristics of eachwave-shape function. On the other hand, the maximum amplitude of acceleration for each wave-shape function is adjusted so as to give the same level of the average value of the maximum ductilityratios of the multi-story structural model. Defining the optimum distribution of shear strength as that giving rise to the uniform distri-bution of the maximum ductility ratio over the height, the following remarks are obtained basedon this analysis: 1) The distribution of the maximum ductility ratio is strongly dependent on the distributionof shear strength whereas the distribution of the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> depends uponthat of stiffness. 2) The increment of the average value of the maximum ductility ratios over the height is almostinversely proportional to that of the average value of shear strengths of a multi-story structuralmodel for a given earthquake excitation. 3) For practical purpose, the optimum distribution of shear strength is determined by averag-ing the distributions of the maximum shear force or those of the maxtmum equivalent shear force,which is defined as the maximum elastic shear force giving the same potential energy to the elasto-plastic energy corresponding to the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement,</b> f'or various models havingdifferent distribution characteristics and for earthquake excitations having appropriate wave-shape functions and time-constants. 4) The optimum distribution of shear strength is yarned depending upon the level of the averagevalue of the maximum ductility ratios as well as the range of the fundamental natural frequency ofstructures. Hence, in general, it has to be determined according to the allowable ductility ratioof structures and the relation between the natural frequencies of structures and the dominant fre-quencies of excitations...|$|R

It is generally agreed that bridges with skew angles greater than 20 ° exhibit complex response characteristics under seismic loads. Saiidi and Orie (1992) noted the skew effects and suggested that simplified models and methods of analysis would result in sufficiently accurate predictions of seismic response for bridges with skew angles less than 15 °. On the other hand, Maleki (2002) concluded that slab-on-girder bridges with skew angles up to 30 ° and spans up to 20 [*]m have comparable response characteristics to straight bridges, and therefore, simplified modeling techniques such as rigid deck modeling were justified in many cases. Bjornsson et al. (1997) conducted an extensive parametric study of two-span skew bridges modeled with rigid deck assumption.

For this purpose a 16 -ply unidirectional CFRP composite laminate specimen with end-notched flexural (ENF) geometry is tested in a 3 -point bend test set-up. The initial crack length to span ratio is a/L = 0. 325. The long span of 160 mm induces a gradual evolution of shear-dominated interlaminar damage and fracture. Finite element (FE) simulation of the test is performed with interlaminar cohesive behavior assumed for the midthickness pre-cracked interface. The measured load-deflection of the ENF specimen is used to validate the FE model with cohesive interface. Hypothetical elastic CFRP composite beams with and without interlaminar edge crack are also modelled as reference cases. Results show that the initial crack reduces flexural stiffness by 30. 2 pct. with insignificant lamina damage.

40|$|At {{the end of}} May 2012, a seismic {{sequence}} {{struck the}} Emilia region in northern Italy, with two main events of local magnitude ML 5. 9 and 5. 8. Emilia has been classified as a seismic area only recently. Consequently {{almost all of the}} precast buildings that have been erected in the past decade haven't been designed with provisions for seismic resilience. Surveys after the earthquake allowed the identification of the damage types and their location: column base, column top, on shed beam, on roof element, on cladding/ infill panels. The scenario confirmed structural damages surveyed after the earthquake in L'Aquila (Menegotto, 2009), (Colombo, 2012). Particularly, it has been pointed out that the weakest elements in precast buidings are connections. Indeed, in precast structures, unlike traditional RC buildings, the design and construction of efficient connections is still a open issue. The connections of cast-in-situ structures present a higher degree of continuity between adjacent elements, also due to passing reinforcing bars. In case of seismic events, joints represent a source of energy dissipation and allow for a redistribution of internal forces (if properly designed). These characteristics lack in many precast buildings, especially in those with industrial applications, which are usually characterized by beams/roof elements simply supported by columns. In such structures, seismic improvement can’t be performed through the introduction of rigid connections, which would increase the stiffness of the structure (which is initially flexible) and lead to unpredictable and sometime negative results such as an increase of the base shear. Moreover, it is not simple to design connections strong enough to resist to stresses induced by earthquakes. Passive control techniques use devices that don’t need energy to work, thus they are very reliable because they won’t malfunction if a black-out occurs. They seem a promising solution for seismic improvement of precast existing buildings. A possible intervention is the introduction of dissipative connections, which would lead to an increase of the behavior factor through energy dissipation. Dissipative connections can be located between different structural/non-structural elements: between roof elements and edge beams, between pillars and edge beams, or between infill panels. This work is focused on the introduction of dissipative connections between roof elements and the substructure. In particular, the objective is finding an algorithm to define the yielding force of connections in function of the <b>maximum</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> allowed between roof elements and substructure. The complex phenomenon, which involves plasticity and the dynamic response of the system, is described through simple equations {{in order to have a}} powerful but simple instrument for design.

40|$|Industrial {{facilities}} must {{be thoroughly}} designed to withstand seismic action as they exhibit an increased loss potential {{due to the}} possibly wide-ranging damage consequences and the valuable process engineering. The design must consider both the primary structure and the architectural or technical secondary structures. In this work integrated design concepts are developed for both parts. Regarding the load carrying system (primary structure) the design approach {{is based on the}} well-established nonlinear-static capacity spectrum method. The method is expanded to consider the unique situation in plant engineering in respect of large eccentricities between the floor mass- and stiffness centres, the influence of higher vibration modes and the numeric modelling of existing structures. As it is a displacement based design procedure it directly provides <b>maximum</b> expected <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> for the design of deformation-sensitive secondary structures like pipes and multi-storey distillation columns. It facilitates performance based design which can easily be used to optimize the structure in order to minimise repair costs and possible down time in case of minor earthquakes. The design concept is illustrated by an application example of a typical production unit. Studies of past earthquakes have shown that in highly industrialised regions the damage of or because of secondary structures can widely exceed the primary damage. Several international codes and standards offer simplified design approaches to cover non-structural components. These design expressions are analysed, and it is shown, that they are not sufficiently general for the most typical practical cases in plant engineering. To amend this, an alternative design approach is developed interpreting the characteristics of floor spectra. The new approach takes the natural periods of the primary and the secondary structure into account and realistically considers the amplification effects of resonance of the non-structural component with higher vibration modes of the primary structure. The concept is validated by comprehensive numerical parameter studies. It furnishes easy-to-use design expressions which can be universally applied to acceleration-sensitive non-structural elements, leading to cost-efficient design alternatives...|$|R
40|$|We {{reproduce}} a magnetospheric reconfiguration under southward interplanetary {{magnetic field}} (IMF) conditions using numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations. To investigate the <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> of the geomagnetic conjugate points, we trace both footprints of the geomagnetic field lines during the magnetospheric reconfiguration under {{positive and negative}} IMF By conditions. Several substormlike features, namely, {{the formation of a}} near-Earth neutral line, a fast earthward flow, and tailward releases of the plasmoid, occur about 1 h after a southward turning of the IMF. The surveyed field line traced from the near-Earth magnetotail was strongly distorted duskward in the north and south after the substorm onset for positive and negative IMF By, respectively. The <b>maximum</b> of the <b>relative</b> longitudinal <b>displacement</b> of both footprints is 4. 5 and 5. 5 h in magnetic local time for positive and negative IMF By, respectively. While observational studies have indicated that the IMF orientation is the main factor controlling the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> of the conjugate points, the present simulation-based study with a constant IMF orientation shows {{for the first time that}} the combined effects of plasma pressure, magnetic field intensity, and the field-aligned current density distribution along the field line are likely to be major factors controlling the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> of conjugate points...|$|R
40|$|Many {{vibration}} isolators can {{be modeled}} with a discontinuity in the stiffness and damping coefficients. The sudden {{change in the}} values of the coefficients can be represented as a piecewise linear or nonlinear function. Soft suspensions are best for isolation; however, a nonlinear hardening suspension is required to minimize <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> at high amplitudes. Often, the physical design limits the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement.</b> Taking advantage of nonlinearity in the suspension is not enough in limiting the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> at very high amplitude. Therefore, a secondary suspension must be involved to limit very high <b>relative</b> <b>displacements.</b> In this investigation, the averaging method was applied to the differential equation generated from the model to find the frequency response.

"This paper proposes a <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> sensor developed to measure directly the relative slip between slab and girder in composite bridges for assessing the health condition of shear connections. The structure, design principle, features, and calibration of the developed <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> sensor are presented. The design of the sensor ensures that there are no voltage outputs for the tension, compression, bending, and torsion effects, but only for the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> between the two connecting pads of the sensor. The accuracy of the developed sensor in measuring the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> response and using it for monitoring the conditions of shear connectors was tested on a composite bridge model in the laboratory. Shear connection condition was monitored under ambient vibrations, then static load tests were conducted to introduce cracks into the composite bridge. Both the vertical deflections and <b>relative</b> <b>displacements</b> were used for the crack detection. Experimental studies demonstrate that the developed sensor is very sensitive to the <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> and has a decent performance for the structural health monitoring of composite bridges.

The developed sensor is an innovative design offering some advantages and unique features, and is a much easier and cheaper method of structural health monitoring due to the simplicity of its direct measurement of <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> {{without the need for}} a stable reference point. To investigate the potential applications of the developed sensor to the damage detection of joint conditions, a steel truss bridge model is fabricated in the laboratory and installed with the developed sensors to detect the loosen bolt damage in the gusset plates by using measured <b>relative</b> <b>displacements.</b> Those measured <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> measurements from the free vibration tests of both the undamaged and damaged truss models are analyzed, and a damage index based on the wavelet packet energy percentage change is used to detect the existence of the loosen bolt damage in steel truss bridges.
