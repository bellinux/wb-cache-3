5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} <b>masking</b> <b>agent</b> which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E

5000|$|Chromium(III) sulfate (Cr(H2O)62(SO4)3) {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as the most efficient and effective tanning agent. Chromium(III) compounds of the sort used in tanning are significantly less toxic than hexavalent chromium. Chromium(III) sulfate dissolves to give the hexaaquachromium(III) cation, Cr(H2O)63+, which at higher pH undergoes processes called olation to give polychromium(III) compounds that are active in tanning, [...] being the cross-linking of the collagen subunits. The chemistry of Cr(H2O)63+ is more complex in the tanning bath rather than in water due {{to the presence of}} a variety of ligands. Some ligands include the sulfate anion, the collagen's carboxyl groups, amine groups from the side chains of the amino acids, and <b>masking</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>Masking</b> <b>agents</b> are carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, used to suppress formation of polychromium(III) chains. <b>Masking</b> <b>agents</b> allow the tanner to further increase the pH to increase collagen's reactivity without inhibiting the penetration of the chromium(III) complexes.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} aroma, taste and texture modalities to overall perception, {{as well as}} the interactions which can occur between them, were studied during the consumption of natural foods, i. e. apples. Aroma, taste and texture perceptions were masked in that order by employing different <b>masking</b> <b>agents,</b> separately or combined, allowing one or several of these senses to be omitted during various matching tasks. By means of Common Components and Specific Weight Analysis (CCSWA), matching results were compared to those of rating tests performed by a trained panel, without <b>masking</b> <b>agents.</b> Taste was the modality which contributed most to apple discrimination, followed by texture and aroma. While taste did not seem to interact with texture, its perception may have been amplified by odorant information. A perceptual taste–taste interaction may also occur during apple consumption. The use of <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> could thus become a useful tool to better understand the perception of several sensations of real natural foods whose formulation cannot be modulated...|$|R

50|$|In {{sports a}} <b>masking</b> <b>agent</b> {{is used to}} hide or prevent {{detection}} of a banned substance or illegal drug like anabolic steroids or stimulants.

40|$|The {{optional}} Escherichia coli prr locus restricts phage T 4 mutants lacking {{polynucleotide kinase}} or RNA ligase. Underlying this restriction is the specific {{manifestation of the}} T 4 -induced anticodon nuclease, an enzyme which triggers the cleavage-ligation of the host tRNALys. We report here the molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence and mutational analysis of prr-associated DNA. The results indicate that prr encodes a latent form of anticodon nuclease consisting of a core enzyme and cognate <b>masking</b> <b>agents.</b> They suggest that the T 4 -encoded factors of anticodon nuclease counteract the prr-encoded <b>masking</b> <b>agents,</b> thus activating the latent enzyme.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{formulate}} and evaluate taste masked Almotriptan orally disintegrating tablet by using different taste <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> and different superdisintegrants in different ratios, Almotriptan is a triptan class anti-migraine drug with rapid action, highest bioavailability and low side effects compared to other triptan class of drugs used in the treatment of migraine, Thus formulating Almotriptan as an orally disintegrating tablet is extremely advantageous. However due to its bitter taste formulating Almotriptan into an orally disintegrating tablet is a challenge. Two taste <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> namely Eudragit EPO and Precirol A To 5 are used to taste mask the drug. The oral disintegrating tablets of Almotriptan were prepared using different superdisintegrants and the effect of different superdisintegrants at different concentration on in-vitro release was studied. Almotriptan release from ODT was directly proportional to the concentration of the superdisintegrant used.

40|$|Among the {{alternative}} mineral tanning agents investigated for replacing chromium, titanium (IV) -based salts {{are one of}} the most promising ones for the development of novel and cleaner tanning processes in the leather industry. The molecular mechanism of the solvation of titanyl salts and their interaction with <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> was investigated in the present work. A computational study based on the quantum mechanical density functional theory was carried out, focusing on the behavior of complexes between titanyl oligomers of suitable length and different <b>masking</b> <b>agents.</b> The optimized structure of a titanyl octamer was calculated. Different carboxylic acids, and their corresponding anions, containing at least two polar functional groups suitable for the complexation of the titanyl, were considered as masking agents: glycolic, lactic, malic, citric, and phthalic acid. The most significant geometric and energetic parameters of the different titanyl-masking agent complexes were calculated. The results obtained indicate that the lactic acid system shows the best binding energies and the best flexibility. The OH–CRR’–COOH structure appears to be well fitted to complex the titanyl chain. The effect of the R and R’ sidechains on complex stabilization seems to be related to electrostatic factors (presence of charge) rather than to steric hindrance...|$|R

50|$|Diuretics, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ‘water pills’, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues {{of the body}} and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart’s pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs.
