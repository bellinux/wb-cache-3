We present a direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cut-off</b> energy in the nuclear {{continuum of}} the nearby Seyfert 1. 9 galaxy MCG– 05 - 23 - 016 with unprecedented precision. The high sensitivity of NuSTAR up to 79 [*]keV allows us to clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum from that of its reflection component. Using a simple phenomenological model for the hard X-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to 116 ^(+ 6) _(- 5) [*]keV with 90 % confidence. Testing for more complex models and nuisance parameters that could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off is detected robustly. We further use simple Comptonized plasma models to provide independent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons in the corona and its optical depth. At the 90 % confidence level, we find kT_e = 29 [*] ± [*] 2 [*]keV and τ_e = 1. 23 ± 0. 08 assuming a slab (disk-like) geometry, and kT_e = 25 ± 2 [*]keV and τe = 3. 5 ± 0. 2 assuming a spherical geometry. Both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their two principal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. With the optical depth in the τ_e ≳ 1 regime, the data are pushing the currently available theoretical models of the Comptonized plasma to the limits of their validity. Since the spectral features and variability arising from the inner accretion disk have been observed previously in MCG– 05 - 23 - 016, the inferred high optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot be homogeneous...|$|R

We performed broadband (0. 3 - 100 keV) spectral analysis by simultaneously fitting the soft and hard X-ray spectra obtained by XMM and INTEGRAL/IBIS-Swift/BAT, respectively, in order to investigate the general properties of these parameters, in particular their distribution and mean values. We find a mean photon index of 1. 73 {{with a standard deviation}} of 0. 17 and a mean high-energy <b>cut-off</b> <b>of</b> 128 keV {{with a standard deviation of}} 46 keV for the whole sample.

This calibration is then applied to the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the lower <b>cut-off</b> <b>of</b> the N-H I-N-H I distribution recently presented by Rudie et al. We infer a power-law T-delta relation, T = T- 0 delta(gamma - 1), with a temperature at mean density, T- 0 = [1. 00 (- 0. 21) (+ 0. 32) ] x 10 (4) k and slope (gamma - 1) = 0. 54 +/- 0. 11. The slope is fully consistent with that advocated by the analysis of Rudie et al.; however, the temperature at mean density is lower by almost a factor of 2, primarily due to an adjustment in the relationship between column density and physical density assumed by these authors. These new results are in excellent agreement with the recent temperature <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> Becker et al., based on the curvature of the transmitted flux in the Ly alpha forest.

Polar cap absorption (PCA) models have therefore been adapted to assimilate real-time <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> zenithal cosmic radio noise absorption (~ 30 MHz) from a large network of online riometers in Canada and Finland. Two types of PCA model have been developed and improvements to model accuracy following optimisation are quantified. Real-time optimisation is performed by age-weighting riometer measurements in a non-linear regression. This reduces root-mean-square errors (RMSE) from 2 - 3 dB to less than 1 dB and mean errors to within ± 0. 2 dB over a wide latitude range. This paper extends previous work by further optimising the models’ dependences on solar-zenith angle to account for differences in the ionospheric response at sunrise and sunset (the Twilight Anomaly). Two models of the rigidity cutoff latitudes are compared and one is optimised in real time by regression to riometer measurements. Whilst measurements from the NASA POES satellites may provide a direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the rigidity <b>cut-off,</b> {{it is observed that}} proton flux measurements from POES often need correcting for relativistic electron contamination for several hours {{at the start of a}} PCA event.

A standardized protocol for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> grip strength {{has been proposed}} in 2011 to enable consistent <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> grip strength and comparisons between studies. It is unknown whether this protocol has been adopted in sarcopenia research and practice. The aim {{of the study was}} to provide insight into current measurement practice, including the use <b>of</b> <b>cut-off</b> values for low muscle strength. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, followed by a methodological quality assessment and extraction of relevant data. Inclusion criteria included a description of the grip strength protocol, EWGSOP standards were used to define sarcopenia, data was collected after 2010 and participants were 65 years and older. Results: Twenty-seven observational papers were included in the review. The methodological quality was acceptable/good. Overall, information about the protocol was limited with a large variability in measurement approach. Most non-Asian studies used cut-off values for low grip strength of 30 kg for men and 20 kg for women. Asian studies showed more variability in choice <b>of</b> <b>cut-off</b> values. Discussion: The proposed grip strength measurement protocol has been poorly adopted since its publication. Although there seems to be some agreement on cut-off values in non-Asian studies, proposed cut-off values need to be evaluated in specific diseases and settings and its predictive abilities regarding outcomes such as mobility limitations and falls needs to be determined. Asian research on cut-off values is still ongoing. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric Medicine Society. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The important feature of the model with which the hot electrons temperature values were obtained is predicted existence of the hot electrons maximum energy (electron spectrum "cut-off energy").

METHODS: We searched Medline (from 1948), Embase (from 1980) and CINAHL (from 1991) to June 2014 to identify studies with information on the normal range of CRT in healthy children, the validity of CRT compared with reference standard measures of haemodynamic status, reliability and factors influencing <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> CRT, such as body site, pressing time and temperature. FINDINGS: We included 21 studies on 1915 children. Four studies provided information on the relationship between CRT and measures of cardiovascular status, 13 provided data on the normal range of CRT, 7 provided data on reliability and 10 assessed the effect of various confounding factors. In children over 7  days of age, the upper limit of normal CRT is approximately 2  s when measured on a finger, and 4  s when measured on the chest or foot, irrespective of whether the child is feverish or not. Longer pressing times and ambient temperature outside 20 °C- 25 °C are associated with longer CRT. Evidence suggests that {{the use of}} stopwatches reduces variability between observers.

Recent stated preference studies show that strategies used by respondents in hypothetical settings are consistent with how they normally process information in real markets. Of the different discrete choice models using cut-offs, the Swait (2001) model allows different heuristics to be captured. The few applications <b>of</b> this soft <b>cut-off</b> approach mainly focus on the effects <b>of</b> <b>cut-offs</b> on attribute estimates and willingness to pay, but scant {{attention has been paid}} to the consequences <b>of</b> <b>cut-off</b> elicitation. We focussed our investigation on the effects <b>of</b> self-reported <b>cut-offs</b> on choice consistency. In line with studies on context and complexity effects in choice modelling, we parameterize the scale parameter on the basis of two alternative measures related to the stated cut-offs: (1) the number of potential violations included in the choice cards, and (2) the number <b>of</b> <b>cut-offs</b> stated at the most severe level. Moreover, we investigated whether different treatments (hypothetical vs. real-money) affect cut-off elicitations, violations and choice consistency. We tested our models using an empirical dataset generated by a field choice experiment on consumers׳ preferences for apples. The data show that most respondents stated they had cut-off values in mind when buying apples, but, as expected, in most cases they violated them in their actual choices. Estimation of heteroskedastic logit models shows that the proposed measures related to stated cut-offs have a systematic effect on the variance of the error term, but only in the hypothetical treatment. That is, respondents were found to be less consistent as the number of potential violations or the number <b>of</b> <b>cut-offs</b> stated at the most severe level increased.
