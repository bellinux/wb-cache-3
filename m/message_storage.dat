40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a (491, 3, 6) time-varying low-den-sity parity check convolutional code (LDPC-CC) decoder chip. This work combines the algorithm level, node level, and bit level optimizations to achieve over 2 Gb/s throughput with acceptable hardware cost and power. The algorithm level optimization is the on-demand variable node activation scheduling with concealing channel values, {{which can not}} only achieve twice faster decoding convergence speed than log-belief propagation (log-BP) algorithm, but also reduce the 17 % <b>message</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The node level optimization duplicates the check node units and variable node units and unfolds the <b>message</b> <b>storage</b> first-in–first-outs (FIFOs) so that the throughput becomes twelve multiplying with clock frequency. In the meantime, the bit level optimization is employed to retime the critical path such that the higher clock frequency can be achieved and <b>message</b> <b>storage</b> size is slightly reduced. Furthermore, a novel hybrid-partitioned FIFO is proposed to provide sufficient memory bandwidth to processing units and alleviate power consumption. With these schemes, a test chip of proposed LDPC-CC decoder has been fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology with core area of. Maximum throughput 2. 37 Gb/s is measured under 1. 2 V supply with energy efficiency of 0. 024 nJ/bit/proc.

40|$|Abiding geocast {{is a time}} stable geocast {{delivered}} to all nodes that are inside a destination region within {{a certain period of}} time. Services like position–based advertising, position–based publish–and–subscribe, and many other location–based services profit from abiding geocast. For vehicular ad hoc networks, abiding geocast allows realization of information and safety applications like virtual warning signs. Similar to real traffic or warning signs, they are attached to a certain geographical position or area. When a vehicle enters such an area, the virtual warning sign is displayed for the driver. This paper discusses the design space, the semantics, and three reasonable approaches for abiding geocast in an ad hoc network. The first one is a server solution to store the messages. The second approach stores the messages at an elected node inside the geocast destination region that temporarily acts as a server. The last one complements the exchange of neighbor information necessary for many unicast routing protocols with abiding geocast information. We compare the proposed protocols with a probabilistic network load and delivery success ratio analysis. The results show that the approaches with local <b>message</b> <b>storage</b> cause less network load. However, we also observed that in some cases the delivery success ratio of the approaches with local <b>message</b> <b>storage</b> is lower...|$|E
