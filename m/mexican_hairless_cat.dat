50|$|According to the New York Tribune, also of 31st December, 1908, “Death, too, has {{invaded the}} exhibit, for the <b>Mexican</b> <b>hairless</b> <b>cat</b> {{died on the}} way to the scene of her {{expected}} triumph. This cat, which was the property of Miss. L. Spink, of Big Lake, Minnesota, is said to be the last of a famous Aztec race.” The owner’s name appears to be an error.|$|E
50|$|This {{indicates}} that the Mexican Hairless, or Aztec, breed were a pair of hairless siblings given a fictionalised account of their origin and the romantic suggestion {{that they were the}} last of their breed. The term <b>Mexican</b> <b>Hairless</b> <b>Cat</b> became a generic term for any hairless cat until 1931 when hairless kittens were born to ordinary furred cats in France and were exhibited by Professor E. Letard.|$|E

50|$|Mrs. Palladino {{replied in}} The Albuquerque Journal, 3 April 1956 that her father, the late Thomas J. Shinick, {{had given her}} two <b>hairless</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>cats</b> as pets. The year was about 1894. She called them Dick and Nellie. She played with them for years. One morning Dick didn’t come home, and the fam,ily {{told her that the}} milkman had stolen him. When Nellie was about 15 years old, her father decided that because <b>hairless</b> <b>cats</b> were so rare, the Smithsonian Institution might be interested. Officials of the {{institution}} asked to see Nellie while she was alive. Mrs. Palladino said Nellie had arrived in Washington in good condition, but died a month later, after which she was exhibited as a taxidermy specimen.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 March 1956, The Albuquerque Journal printed another {{request for}} information: [...] "John White, {{head of the}} {{department}} of information of the state extension service and the Experiment Station at New Mexico A&M College, has a letter from an El Pasoan who wants information on what is called the Mexican, and sometimes New Mexico, <b>hairless</b> <b>cat.</b> White is stumped. So are the others in the department. The El Paso man first wrote to Mexico City College, Mexico City, for information. The college apparently told him the animal was mouse-colored and the underparts were pinkish. The animal also has a ridge of fur along the back and upper surface of the tail. Mexico City College advised the El Pasoan to write to New Mexico A&M. Many know of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>hairless</b> dog, but, says white, if anyone has seen a New Mexico <b>Hairless</b> <b>cat,</b> or knows there is such an animal, he’d like to hear about it." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1902, {{a couple}} from New Mexico {{received}} two <b>hairless</b> <b>cats</b> from local Pueblo Indians. These were purportedly the last survivors {{of an ancient}} Aztec breed of cat. The cats were litter-mates and noted to be 25% smaller than local shorthair cats. They were normally whiskered and seasonally coated, growing a ridge of fur down the mid-back and tail during the colder seasons. These were not the first <b>hairless</b> <b>cats</b> exhibited in the USA, but they became the most famous. An earlier detailed report {{of a pair of}} <b>hairless</b> <b>cats</b> in The Boston Post, January 22, 1878. Two <b>hairless</b> <b>cats,</b> “Scud,” a male, and “ Mystery,” a female, owned by William P. Marshall, were exhibited. These cats were a brother and sister. Although novelties, they had an ordinary background, being born to a normal shorthair cat, and did not become a sensation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>Hairless</b> <b>cat,</b> Aztec cat or New Mexican Hairless was a purported {{breed of}} cat first {{documented}} in 1902 by Mr. E.J.Shinick {{who owned a}} pair of hairless cats. The cats were novelties at this time because of their lack of a coat (fur), although they grew light fur along the back and tail in winter. These cats also had long Whiskers and eyebrows. Because they had no coat, they lost more body heat than coated cats. This made them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking. They are well documented in media reports in the early 20th Century.|$|E
5000|$|After that time, other {{randomly}} occurring hairless cats {{were also}} called (New) Mexican Hairless or Aztec cats. The term became generic instead of {{referring to the}} cats' location of origin. Charles Henry Lane reported in his book [...] "Rabbits, Cats and Cavies" [...] (1903) [...] that a <b>Mexican</b> <b>Hairless</b> <b>Cat</b> called [...] "Jesuit" [...] belonged to the Hon. Mrs McLaren Morrison (a notable cat breeder and collector of rarities). This was the only specimen Mr. Lane had seen and he believed {{it to be the}} only one ever exhibited in England. A portrait of the cat was included in his book. Jesuit could only have been another random mutation, because Nellie was too valuable to leave the USA.|$|E

It is not related to the better known <b>hairless</b> breed of <b>cat</b> the Sphynx, also known as the Canadian hairless, whose characteristic hairlessness is caused by a recessive gene, whereas the Don hairlessness is caused by a dominant gene.|$|R
