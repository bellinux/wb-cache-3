40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Seed {{moisture}} is {{a primary}} factor influencing seed quality during harvesting, storage, and marketing of grass seed. However, the Association of Official Seed Analysts' Rules for Testing Seeds do not contain methods for moisture testing. The oven methods in use by seed testing laboratories in the U. S. are diverse and many produce erroneous results. The International Seed Testing Association Rules for Seed Testing contain methods for 95 kinds of seeds, {{but many of the}} methods are empirical in nature and lacking in accuracy. The objective of this research was to develop accurate oven moisture testing methods for seeds of temperate grass species. The test variables investigated were oven temperature, time of drying, grinding the seed, and original moisture level of the seed. Chi-square analysis was used to determine if the results of the oven methods were within +̲ 0. 5 % of those obtained by the Karl Fischer reference method. The species included were perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis Huds.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.). Drying to constant weight at temperatures of 90, 100, and 105 °C gave <b>moisture</b> <b>percentages</b> lower than the true value. Drying periods of 6 h or less at 130 °C gave <b>moisture</b> <b>percentages</b> in agreement with Karl Fischer results. Ground and whole seed gave similar <b>moisture</b> <b>percentages</b> after drying to constant weight, but moisture was removed more rapidly from ground seeds. The required drying time for greatest accuracy depended on the original moisture content of the seed. Moisture was removed most rapidly from the highest moisture seed; thus, {{it is not possible to}} select one drying period that will provide the same degree of accuracy on seed with different moisture levels. Seed moisture tests on these six temperate-climate grass species should be conducted on whole seeds at 130 °C. The drying periods should be 3 h for perennial ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and red fescue, 1. 5 h for orchardgrass, and 1 h for bentgrass...|$|R

50|$|The {{genesis of}} the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an {{important}} application was the steam engine. Low quality steam would contain a high <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage</b> and therefore damage components more easily. High quality steam would not corrode the steam engine. Steam engines use water vapour (steam) to drive pistons or turbines which create work. The quality of steam can be quantitatively described by steam quality (steam dryness), the proportion of saturated steam in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a steam quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a steam quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam.|$|E

The texture of the soil ranged from loamy sand to sandy loam at the surface and sandy loam to sandy clay loam at the subsurface.

Increasing the {{moisture content}} of the gas stream by spraying water or injecting steam into the duct work preceding the ESP lowers the resistivity.

This study examined the accuracy of combine-mounted yield sensors with traditional weigh wagon methodology in on-farm corn hybrid strip trials. Data from combine-mounted sensors for plot weight, <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage,</b> and yield were compared with weigh wagon weight, handheld moisture testers, and calculated yield in six nonreplicated strip trials in 2012, 2013, and 2014 in east-central South Dakota. A total of 195 total entries were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regressions for weight, <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage,</b> and yield were calculated for each environment and for all environments combined. The Pearson correlation coefficients across all environments were 0. 998 for weight of grain in pounds, 0. 928 for grain moisture content percentage, and 0. 983 for yield in bushels per acre corrected for moisture content. The probability of nonsignificance for weight, <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage,</b> and yield was P 3 ̆c 0. 0001.

The water status parameters include leaf water content per unit leaf area (LWC), specific leaf water content (SWC), leaf <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage</b> on fresh weight (LMP), relative leaf water content (RWC) and relative leaf <b>moisture</b> <b>percentage</b> on fresh weight basis (RMP). Furthermore, effective spectral reflectance and reflectance ratio were identified for estimating the LWC, SWC, LMP, RWC and RMP.

Moreover, these experimental formulas {{could be used to}} estimate the leaf moisture conditions of the soybean under nutrition and water stresses, but satisfactory results were not reached for the case of maize.
