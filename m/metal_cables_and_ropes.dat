50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Tiger Moth design is its differential aileron control setup. The ailerons (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an externally mounted circular bellcrank, which lies flush with the lower wing's fabric undersurface covering. This circular bellcrank is rotated by <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> chains from the cockpit's control columns, and has the externally mounted aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bellcrank's centre, when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an aileron control system operating, with barely any travel down {{at all on the}} wing {{on the outside of the}} turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.|$|R
40|$|Polymers with a rodlike {{conformation}} can be spun into ultra {{high strength}} fibres which find {{applications in the}} manufacture of light weight composites, <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> protective clothing, among others. The polymerization of such rodlike molecules, which are made by solution polycondensation, is qualitatively different from flexible molecules. For rodlike polymers, nearly parallel orientation of the reacting pair of is a necessary condition for reaction, and this results in slowing of the reaction due to very slow rotational diffusion of the molecules. Flow can easily orient rodlike molecules due to their anisotropic shape and low rotational diffusivity, and thus has an impact on polymerization kinetics. The role of polymer dynamics on the polymerization kinetics of rodlike molecules is reviewed, as is the effect of dynamics on the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of the product. The implications for practical applications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainties {{about the}} long term bearing {{capacity}} of aramid fibres have made designers reluctant to utilize them for external pre-stressing for cable-stayed bridges. Recent research carried out on cable-stayed bridges {{has found that the}} steel cables, although well protected from the external environment, are subject to corrosion, resulting in a risk of structural defects and malfunctions. The question that prompted this study is whether simple and non-destructive non-linearity tests can be used for assessing structural damage in aramid fibres or elements. The concept is to detect weak non-linearities in the dynamic response measured on fibres <b>and</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> to use the level of non-linearity as an indicator for evaluating the residual life span of aramid elements, <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ropes.</b> In perspective, a non-linearity test may be easily integrated in structural health monitoring protocols to be employed on aramid <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> elements to collect timely notifications about possible anomalies in the structural behaviour. In order to investigate the sensitivity of such an approach to structural health monitoring, non-linearity characterisation tests were conducted on aramid fibres by applying controlled sweep-sine excitations at different loading levels. In order to have a comparative term and to test the setup machine, a similar characterisation procedure was also applied to a novel material, the silicon carbide, which is known to exhibit a purely brittle behaviour, with no appreciable plastic deformatio...|$|R

50|$|Although Herodotus {{appears to}} be clear in saying that the initial bridges were {{destroyed}} by a storm,{herodotus 7.34} very little information {{can be derived from}} this phrase. It is left to speculation whether and to what extent ships, <b>cables,</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> logs were recovered, saved, repaired and reused. On the other hand, there is no indication of a total loss and that all elements of the bridges had to be procured again. The preparation of the bridges lasted months, if not years. Therefore, replacement deliveries of ships, <b>cables,</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> logs would have taken at least some months. The initial placement of the wooden logs and the earth cover must initially have taken several days. Even if one assumes that no replacement deliveries were necessary and that all items could have been repaired, those repairs must have taken several days. During this time, the army waiting at the shore would have got into a very serious situation, since the provisions of food, fodder and water had not been calculated to cope with a prolonged stay.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation on the long-term {{behavior and the}} structure-property relation in high performance polymeric fibers. These fibers have wide applications in structural <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> reinforced composites. Therefore, the understanding of their structure-property relation and their behavior under external mechanical stress is very important. ^ The fatigue and creep behavior were studied. A general lifetime equation was derived to correlate the material lifetime with the applied stress level. The failure criterion of “critical strain” was identified. The failure mechanism was {{shown to be a}} deformation route. The fatigue lifetime was predicted from known material constants. Several material parameters were defined to characterize the fatigue and creep properties. The fatigue property is characterized by the fatigue strength and fatigue strength index; while the creep property is characterized by the creep strength and creep strength index. The fatigue strength index was used to show that fiber with a rigid chain structure, such as Kevlar®, Techanora ® and Vectran®, generally have better fatigue resistance than a flexible chain fiber, such as Spectra®. ^ Twisting was found to influence yarn properties. A model based on composite theory was developed to predict the change in the yarn modulus with the degree of twist. ^ The desire for nondestructive prediction of the residual lifetime of a used material initiated the efforts to find a signature of the stress and thermal history in Kevlar® fibers. To achieve this, a new testing methodology has been developed. An iso-strain force-temperature test (IFTT) was shown to yield quantitative information on the stress and thermal history as well as the information of relaxation and transitions in many materials. The IFTT behavior of a Kevlar® fiber maps well with its structure examined by X-ray diffraction. The IFTT was also used to screen the processing for property enhancement via post-treatment. ^ Different post-treatment routes have been investigated for Kevlar ® fiber. Tension, heat, hydrostatic pressure, and different media of water, mercury and silicon oil have been utilized to alter the materials. The evolution of its property and structure have been carefully examined. It is shown that the modulus of PPTA is determined by two structure parameters: misorientation and a paracrystalline parameter. ...|$|R
