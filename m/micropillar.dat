40|$|The uniform {{dispersion}} of cells in a microchamber {{is important to}} reproduce results in cellular research. However, achieving this is difficult owing to the laminar flow caused by the small dimensions of such a chamber. In this study, we propose a technique to achieve a uniform distribution of cells using a <b>micropillar</b> array inside a microchamber. The cells deform when they pass through {{a gap between the}} micropillars. The deformation causes a repetitive clog-and-release process of cells at the gaps between the micropillars. The <b>micropillar</b> array generates random flow inside the microchamber, resulting in the uniform distribution of the cells via cell accumulation. In the experiment, the distribution of cells in the microchamber with the <b>micropillar</b> array is uniform from end to end, whereas that in the microchamber without the <b>micropillar</b> array is centered. The deviation of the cell distribution from the ideally uniform distribution in the microchamber with the <b>micropillar</b> array is suppressed by 63 % compared with that in the microchamber without the <b>micropillar</b> array. The doubling time of the cells passed through the <b>micropillar</b> array did not change relative to that of normal N 87 cells.
