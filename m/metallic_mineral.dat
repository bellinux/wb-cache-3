25|$|The {{industry}} sector {{was the worst}} performing sector of the regional economy with a continuous decline from 2001-2003. Although the sector's slide slightly decelerated in 2002 (-6.7% in 2002 from -13.3% decline in 2001), it contracted by -12.1% in 2003. The construction subsector had the largest decline of 16.6%, 11.3% and 33.5% in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. The mining subsector also posted negative growth rates but the decreasing trend in this subsector decelerated. The manufacturing offset the decrease in the two sub-sectors by growing at 8.9% in 2003, making it the biggest contributor to this sector. It {{should be noted that}} even with the negative performance of the mining and quarrying sector, Caraga was the second highest producer of metallic minerals, with <b>metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> productions valued at PhP 1.25 billion in 2001 (Philippine Yearbook, 2003).|$|E
2500|$|In post-glacial times Northeastern Minnesota {{was covered}} by forest broken only by these {{interconnected}} lakes and wetlands. [...] Much of the area has been little changed by human activity, as there are substantial forest and wilderness preserves, most notably the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and Voyageurs National Park. [...] In {{the remainder of the}} region, lakes provide recreation, forests are managed for pulpwood, and the underlying bedrock is mined for valuable ores deposited in Precambrian times. [...] While copper and nickel ores have been mined, the principal <b>metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> is iron. [...] Three of Minnesota's four iron ranges are in the region, including the Mesabi Range, which has supplied over 90% of the state's historic output, including most of the natural ores pure enough to be fed directly into furnaces. [...] The state's iron mines have produced over three and a half billion metric tons of ore.

40|$|Three-dimensional CT {{images of}} the Allende {{meteorite}} with a high resolution of 10 μm have been obtained nondestructively by a monochromatic X-ray computed tomography (CT) based on synchrotron radiation (SR). The <b>metallic</b> <b>minerals,</b> matrix and chondrules can be clearly observed in the CT images. The CT values, which express the image intensity, allow a quantitative elemental analysis including such as difference in the <b>metallic</b> <b>minerals,</b> i. e., pentlandite and troilite, using the comparison of CT images and elemental images measured by a computer-aided microanalyzer (CMA). The three-dimensional CT images indicate that the <b>metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> surround some chondrules, and the largest chondrule has two humps and well crystallized olivine in its center. These observations suggest that the three-dimensional SR-CT system is a useful method for identification of internal structures of stony meteorites.
