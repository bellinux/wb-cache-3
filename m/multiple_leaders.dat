Apart from the fertiliser options, current operational plantation establishment practices were used. Application of a nitrogen-phosphorus fertiliser shortly after planting produced increased growth for E. nitens amounting to 30 m 3 /ha by age 7 years. Eucalyptus regnans also responded to fertiliser application, but overall growth was {{less than half that}} of the E. nitens. This slower growth was due to early severe and repeated insect attacks. Insect attack also caused increased double and <b>multiple</b> <b>leadering</b> in the E. regnans. Normal rates of nitrogen-phosphorus fertiliser application (25 g N and 11 g P/tree) resulted in an increase in branch size compared with trees without fertiliser, and the mean largest branch diameter was increased by 6 mm for E. nitens. <b>Multiple</b> <b>leadering</b> also increased, from 2 % to 10 %.

50|$|Large pruning wounds, such {{as those}} left behind in trees after topping, may become entry points for {{pathogens}} and may result in extensive decay. Decay undermines, to greater or lesser extent, the long-term health and physical stability of trees; most notably in those species which compartmentalize decay less effectively. Should a tree survive topping, tissue regrowth {{at the site of}} the original topping wound(s) is generally profuse. These new <b>multiple</b> <b>leaders</b> are less well-attached than was the original treetop, partly due to the effect of advancing decay at the wound site. As these weakly attached trunks increase in size, they become more prone to fall from the tree. Wind can increase this potential. Previously topped trees can present significant hazards and should be inspected by a qualified arborist, who can recommend possible solutions, such as removal, cabling, bracing, or ongoing inspection.Aesthetic appeal is also compromised by topping, as the natural shapes of trees are lost.|$|E

5000|$|Esen's {{aggressive}} actions irritated {{and threatened}} the Ming dynasty. The Ming had {{for some time}} pursued a [...] "divide and rule" [...] strategy in dealings with their northern neighbors, maintaining trade and tribute relationships, functioning {{as a kind of}} state-subsidized monopoly, with <b>multiple</b> <b>leaders</b> who they could then turn against one another by inciting jealousy or suggesting intrigue. A unified Mongolia under one ruler was, however, much less susceptible to such tactics. Many of the tribes brought under Oirat dominion by conquest had inhabited areas claimed by the Ming, and other tribes had been pushed south into Chinese territory seeking to escape Oirat subjugation. The Chagatayid Hami oasis, furthermore, had paid tribute to the emperor before Esen convinced its ruler to pay tribute to the Oirats instead. Throughout the 1440s, Esen increased both the frequency of tribute missions to China and the number of representatives sent on each mission, meaning that the Chinese were obliged to provide ever-more expensive hospitality to the Mongols, irrespective of the actual trade or tribute being negotiated. According to surviving Chinese accounts, the Oirats demanded more and more lucrative tribute and trade agreements further skewed in the Mongol favor.|$|E
5000|$|Shared {{leadership}} is also commonly {{thought of as}} the [...] "serial emergence" [...] of <b>multiple</b> <b>leaders</b> over the life of a team, stemming from interactions among team members in which at least one team member tries to influence other members or the team in general. [...] While the definition clearly has several variants, they all make the fundamental distinction between shared leadership and more traditional notions of hierarchical leadership. As Pearce, Manz and Sims (2009) summarize, all definitions of shared leadership consistently include a [...] "process of influence" [...] that is [...] "built upon more than just downward influence on subordinates or followers by an appointed or elected leader." [...] Nearly all concepts of shared leadership entail the practice of [...] "broadly sharing power and influence among a set of individuals rather than centralizing it {{in the hands of a}} single individual who acts in the clear role of a dominant superior." [...] Therefore, shared {{leadership is}} an emergent team property of mutual influence and shared responsibility among team members, whereby they lead each other toward goal achievement. It differs from team leadership, team processes and team work in that shared leadership describes a set of cooperatively oriented cognitions, attitudes, and actions through which team members convert member inputs to team outputs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In nano-based microarchitectural design, {{achieving}} higher {{clock frequency}} is confronted with thermal restrictions {{especially with the}} presense of temperature-variant leakage power. While a module temperature depends both on power density and the thermal coupling with the neighboring blocks, thermal-aware floorplans have been introduced to reduce peak temperature. The major drawback is that the thermal behavior is input application dependent. Considering average or peak power density may lead either to underestimation of the thermal crisis or to degradation in performance. To provide more realistic temperature estimation, we propose to apply multiple power profiles during floorplanning. Using the proposed statistical methods to determine the closeness between the power profiles, we apply our clustering algorithm to identify power profiles with close thermal behavior. We then generate a set of power profiles as leader power profiles to be incorporated in a thermal-aware floorplanner. Our empirical results show that using the single leader power profile (average or peak) leads to 37 % degradation in critical wire delay and 20 % degradation in wire length, compared to using the <b>multiple</b> <b>leader</b> power profiles. Our correlation metrics coupled with the clustering algorithm gives comparable improvements in the floorplanning with improved runtime as well. I...|$|R
