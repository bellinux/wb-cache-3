40|$|This article {{presents}} a field research about organizational culture and social network that {{was carried out}} in Service Company. The central question of this research is: How the values of organizational culture are interconnected with social networks? The goal was verify if there is an influence of the culture of the organization in the characteristic of the Social Groups, with emphasis in centrality. The national and international literature focuses that that to work with centrality means to identify the position of the actors are in relation to the exchanges and network communication; The centrality in the network brings the idea of power, that means, as much centered the person is, it has a better position in relation to exchanges and communication as highlight Hanneman e Riddle (2005). Regarding the methodological procedures this is a exploratory study with quantitative nature. The research was made with two set of questions that were elaborated by Nelson (2006) and Nelson e Vasconcelos (2007). The first is related to the organizational culture and is called Aggregated Values Profile (AVP), that identify the presence and priorities attributed inside the organization in relation to the subjects: Work “task”; “social” Relations; “power” Control and Cognitions “thoughts”. The second related to the formed network, whose tools are made by the presentation of a list with all the participants of the research and was asked to each member, information about the nature of nearest contact and each name. The places for name and position came already filled by the researchers, the place for approval and for the number of E-mails received and sent were filled by chance from the respondent, and the field dependency was answered considering the scale 1 to 6, where 1 represents “fill” and 6 represents “a lot” dependency from another person. It was taken a sample of 58 respondents, all of them workers from the Service Company were the research was carried out. The data were worked out by the a non-parametric statistical technique, from Mann Whitney, to the cultural values, and the data for Social Network the numbers were found trough Ucinet 6. 0 Software, from Borgatti, Everett and Freeman (2002). The results shows that the central points, that means, those that have a higher number of contact in the network, are more aligned with the values of the organizational culture. That means that they can influence and participate in the dissemination of values that are found in the organizational culture. What one can perceive when analyzing the list of the names and position of the workers is that that the four more centralized actors in the network have management position or have some kind of leadership in the researched organization. The first is <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> the personnel department, the second element is more central <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legal</b> <b>department,</b> the third element most central and sub-operations manager and works closely with the Operations Manager, the fourth element is operational supervisor. The benefits and the minimization of the costs in the social interactions if the company make use of those central elements in Coaching Program e or Mentoring, or in other changing actions, can help in bringing the workers out of the area of comfort and help in disseminate quickly the Mission, Vision and Values or the Organization...|$|R
