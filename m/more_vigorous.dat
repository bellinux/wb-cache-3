5|$|Rai school sugata {{resembles that}} of the late Heian/early Kamakura period being both gentle and graceful, but grander and with a <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> workmanship. Starting with Kunimitsu, the kissaki becomes larger. The jihada is small-grain mokume-hada, dense with ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei. The quality of the jigane is {{slightly}} inferior {{to that of the}} Awataguchi school. The hamon shows medium suguha with chōji midare.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|Long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis VII continued during the 1160s, the French king slowly becoming <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> in opposing Henry's increasing power in Europe. In 1160 Louis strengthened his alliances in central France with the Count of Champagne and Odo II, the Duke of Burgundy. Three {{years later the}} new Count of Flanders, Philip, concerned about Henry's growing power, openly allied himself with the French king. Louis's wife Adèle {{gave birth to a}} male heir, Philip Augustus, in 1165, and Louis was more confident of his own position than for many years previously. As a result, relations between Henry and Louis deteriorated again in the mid-1160s.|$|E
5000|$|The terms [...] "species tulips" [...] and [...] "botanical tulips" [...] {{refer to}} wild species in {{contrast}} to hybridised varieties. As a group they {{have been described as}} being less ostentatious but <b>more</b> reliably <b>vigorous</b> as they age.|$|R
50|$|The Sun style (孙氏) t'ai chi ch'uan is {{well known}} for its smooth, flowing {{movements}} which omit the <b>more</b> physically <b>vigorous</b> crouching, leaping and fa jin of some other styles. Its gentle postures and high stances make it very suitable for martial arts therapy.|$|R

5|$|The Baška tablet, a stone {{inscribed with}} the glagolitic {{alphabet}} {{found on the}} Krk island and dated to 1100, {{is considered to be}} the oldest surviving prose in Croatian. The beginning of <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> development of Croatian literature is marked by the Renaissance and Marko Marulić. Besides Marulić, Renaissance playwright Marin Držić, Baroque poet Ivan Gundulić, Croatian national revival poet Ivan Mažuranić, novelist, playwright and poet August Šenoa, children's writer Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić, writer and journalist Marija Jurić Zagorka, poet and writer Antun Gustav Matoš, poet Antun Branko Šimić, expressionist and realist writer Miroslav Krleža, poet Tin Ujević and novelist and short story writer Ivo Andrić are often cited as the greatest figures in Croatian literature.|$|E
5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's predators {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This small insectivorous falcon is better at detecting a predator and <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> in defence than its corvid neighbours. The breeding {{success of the}} red-billed chough {{in the vicinity of}} the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).|$|E

5000|$|Physical Activity: Be {{physically}} active {{as part of}} everyday life. Regular activity and movement {{has been reported to}} keep hormone levels healthy. Some hormones when at a high level can increase your cancer risk. Physical activity can improve the immune system. This can effectively lower cancer risk even further. Scientists recommend that people “aim for 60 minutes or more of moderate activity every day, or 30 minutes or <b>more</b> of <b>vigorous</b> activity.” ...|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{language}} of the Geneva Bible was <b>more</b> forceful and <b>vigorous,</b> most readers strongly preferred this version to the Great Bible. In the words of Cleland Boyd McAfee, [...] "it drove the Great Bible off the field by sheer power of excellence".|$|R
25|$|If at first, from 1873, {{the young}} Paul Biva was {{influenced}} by the zeitgeist for genre scenes and landscapes—electing to paint landscapes that evoke those of Jean-Baptiste Corot—he subsequently explored other paths and other subjects. His flowers became <b>more</b> expressive, <b>vigorous</b> yet delicate and full of freshness, while Henri Biva's landscapes offered an intimate glimpse of a specific locale, characterized by intricate strokes and a pure palette bathed with warm natural light. Both Biva's devoted great attention to light effects.|$|R
50|$|The right middle lobe {{and left}} lingula {{of the lungs}} are served by bronchi that are {{oriented}} downward {{when a person is}} in the upright position. As a result, these areas of the lung may be <b>more</b> dependent upon <b>vigorous</b> voluntary expectoration (cough) for clearance of bacteria and secretions.|$|R
5|$|Determined {{to avenge}} the defeat, the {{president}} ordered Major General Arthur St. Clair, who was {{serving as the}} governor of the Northwest Territory, to mount a <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> effort by the third quarter of 1791. After considerable trouble finding men and supplies, St. Clair was finally ready. At dawn on November 4, 1791, his poorly trained force, accompanied by about 200 camp followers, was camped near the present-day location of Fort Recovery, Ohio, with poor defenses set up around their camp. An Indian force consisting of around 2,000 warriors led by Little Turtle, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh, struck with swift and overwhelming displays of force, and, paralyzing the Americans with fear, soon overran their poorly prepared perimeter. St. Clair’s army was almost annihilated during the three-hour encounter. The American casualty rate included 632 of 920 soldiers and officers killed (69%) and 264 wounded. Nearly all of the 200 camp followers were slaughtered, for a total of about 832.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{arrived in}} Australia and {{continued}} its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training there was <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke his heel bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase {{was chosen to}} lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise came to the fore. He resisted the temptation to overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced {{by the rest of the}} division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.|$|E
50|$|This genus is a {{lineage of}} non-tuberculate species that is {{characteristic}} by its rewinded shells. Primary ribs are rounded, wide, sometimes bifurcating. They are crossing the venter without interruption {{and can be}} paired. Secondary ribs are <b>more</b> or less <b>vigorous,</b> weakened or erased at venter and they are also usually simple.|$|R
40|$|This study {{surveys and}} {{attempts}} to interpret the different behavioral interactions between the solitary wasp Liris nigra V. d. L, and crickets of the species Gryllulus domesticus L. in different hunting situations. Significant variations are recorded, {{some of which are}} predictable, others not. Wasp-cricket interactions and responses become <b>more</b> frequent, <b>vigorous</b> and complete from onset to peak of the hunting phase. Discussion is concerned mainly with releasing conditions, with characteristics and possible meaning of the interactions and responses. The problem is placed in the context of general defense, alarm reactions, predator-prey interactions and possible corresponding behavioral adaptations...|$|R

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade, Smederevo and Veliko Gradište {{continued}} {{to be subjected to}} <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> artillery bombardments, and a number of failed attempts to cross the Danube resulted in heavy Austro-Hungarian losses. The bulk of the Austro-Hungarian forces were stationed in Bosnia, and the Serbian General Staff were not misled by these feints on the Danube. Subsequently, the Austro-Hungarians attempted to cross the Drina at Ljubovija and the Sava at Šabac, and these attacks were seen as more significant. On 12 August, Austro-Hungarian troops entered Serbia through the town of Loznica, crossing the Drina. There, and in the village of Lešnica, the Austro-Hungarian 13th Army Corps made a crossing, while on the same day the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army Corps crossed the Sava to the north of Šabac, while other Austro-Hungarian troops crossed the Drina. The town of Šabac was quickly taken. By 14 August, over a front of about , the Austro-Hungarians had crossed the rivers and converged on Valjevo. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd and 5th Armies moved towards Belgrade, where they encountered the Serbian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies. On 15 August, Putnik ordered his forces into counterattack.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
60|$|The subject {{gradually}} floated away, {{and gave}} place to others, till a heavy tramp, {{and something like}} the struggling {{of a man who}} was being dragged away, were heard outside. The sounds soon died out, and the interruption seemed to make the last hour's conviviality <b>more</b> resolute and <b>vigorous.</b> Every one was willing to forget a disagreeable incident.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} factor structure, related {{constructs}} and {{internal consistency of}} the Child Activity Limitation Interview 21 -Child version for use in Dutch-language countries. Cross-sectional validation study: After forward and back translation of the Dutch version of the Child Activity Limitation Interview 21 -Child adolescents (11 - 21 years old) with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed an assessment. The assessment contained the Dutch Child Activity Limitation Interview, and questionnaires about demographics, pain intensity, functional disability, anxiety and depression. Internal consistency and construct validity were evaluated through exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring with oblique rotation) and hypotheses testing using pain intensity, activity limitations, anxiety and depression as comparative constructs. Seventy-four adolescents completed the assessment. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a two-factor structure, explaining 50 % of the variance. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α[*]=[*] 0. 91 total scale, α[*]=[*] 0. 90 Factor 1, α[*]=[*] 0. 80 Factor 2). All nine hypotheses were confirmed. The Dutch version can be used to assess pain-related disability in Dutch-speaking adolescents comparable to the study sample. Scores on both subscales provide insight into the severity of the pain-related disability in both daily routine and <b>more</b> physically <b>vigorous</b> activities. Implications for Rehabilitation Chronic pain is a disabling disorder which not only impacts physically but restricts quality of life. This study provides clinicians a questionnaire to measure pain-related disability and quantify the impact of pain on the daily living of adolescents. The advantage of the Dutch version of the Child Activity and Limitations Interview over other measurements is that it can distinguish limitations in daily activities from <b>more</b> physically <b>vigorous</b> activitie...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to wet fields and localized flooding, this winter’s record snow cover {{is likely to}} contribute to abundant winter annual weed infestations in no-till fields. In most years, winter annual infestations suffer significant mortality due to cold temperatures and freeze/thaw cycles, but the snow provided a blanket of protection. Thus, winter annual infestations will likely be <b>more</b> abundant and <b>vigorous</b> than in typical years...|$|R
25|$|A nearly six-month {{period of}} {{relative}} quiet at the volcano ended on December 27, 2009, with renewed earthquake swarms. The AVO subsequently raised the alert level, and again {{warned of the}} possibility of a <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> eruption due to dome collapse.|$|E
25|$|The Boston Bypass Independents {{were elected}} to Boston Borough Council at the 2007 local elections. The party campaigned {{on a wide}} range of issues but principally on the <b>more</b> <b>vigorous</b> {{promotion}} of a bypass for the town of Boston, Lincolnshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} of Fascist quadrumvir Cesare Maria De Vecchi {{as governor of}} the Italian Aegean Islands in 1936 marked a turning point.

50|$|It erupts for a {{duration}} {{of a few}} seconds with an interval of 1 - 3 minutes between eruptions. Eruptions tend to be small, sometimes no <b>more</b> than a <b>vigorous</b> roiling of the pool but can reach 1 to 3 ft. Prior to 1985, Spindle had eruptions as large as 10 ft. Spindle also generates subterranean thumps that can be felt when standing near the geyser.|$|R
50|$|As {{opposed to}} Džore Držić, Menčetić's opus {{contains}} longer lyrical narratives, and lyrical subject is <b>more</b> immediate, <b>vigorous,</b> lascivious and eroticized, and {{the topic of}} and the sensuality of reciprocated love is emphasized. The most distinguished role model is Francesco Petrarca, and that makes Menčetić, beside Džore Držić, the first Croatian Petrarchist. He belonged to Strambottists, which detach themselves from certain Petrarchan ideas: noticeable {{is the absence of}} Neoplatonisms, sensuality comes to be accentuated as the poets draw more close to vernacular forms (strambotto, rispetto), and sonnet is being abandoned. Most of the opus thematically inherits Petrarchism though - beauty and the pleasures of the poet's beloved are being described, but in several poems Menčetić diverges from classical Petrarchism celebrating the happiness of a lover whose pleas have been conceded.|$|R
5000|$|Huehueteotl is {{frequently}} considered to overlap with, or be another aspect of, a central Mexican/Aztec deity associated with fire, Xiuhtecuhtli. In particular the Florentine Codex identifies Huehueteotl {{as an alternative}} epithet for Xiutecuhtli, and consequently that deity is {{sometimes referred to as}} Xiutecuhtli-Huehueteotl. [...] However, Huehueteotl is characteristically depicted as an aged or even decrepit being, often with a beard, whereas Xiutecuhtli's appearance is much <b>more</b> youthful and <b>vigorous,</b> in line with his marked association with rulership and (youthful) warriors.|$|R
