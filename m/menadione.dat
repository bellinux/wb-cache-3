40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study with}} chicks was {{conducted}} to compare the relative vitamin K 3 stability of various <b>menadione</b> preparations in mash and pellets. The preparations assayed were <b>menadione</b> sodium bisulfite, <b>menadione</b> sodium bisulfite complex, <b>menadione</b> dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite and Kastab (a physically stabilized preparation of <b>menadione</b> sodium bisulfite). Pelleting increased the stability of all preparations when measured by the partial thromboplastin assay. The general trend in stability obtained by both procedures was in decreasing order: Kastab, <b>menadione</b> dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite, <b>menadione</b> bisulfite complex and <b>menadione</b> bisulfite.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of <b>menadione</b> on porcine aortic endothelial cell prostaglandin synthesis. Addition of 1 - 20 microM <b>menadione</b> caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of stimulated prostaglandin synthesis with an IC 50 of 5 microM at 15 min. Concentrations greater than 100 microM <b>menadione</b> were necessary to increase 51 Cr release from prelabeled cells. Recovery of enzyme inactivated by <b>menadione</b> required a 6 -h incubation in 1 % serum. In a microsomal preparation, <b>menadione</b> was shown to have no direct effect on conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In intact cells <b>menadione</b> caused only a 40 % inhibition of the conversion of PGH 2 to prostacyclin. Enzymes involved in the incorporation and the release of arachidonic acid were not affected by <b>menadione</b> (20 microM, 15 min). <b>Menadione</b> undergoes oxidation/reduction reactions in intact cells leading to partial reduction of oxygen-forming, reactive oxygen species. In our cells <b>menadione</b> was found to increase KCN-resistant oxygen consumption. Further, an increased accumulation of H 2 O 2 was observed with a time course consistent with menadione-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. We conclude that <b>menadione</b> at sublethal doses caused inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.

40|$|<b>Menadione</b> is a {{naphthoquinone}} {{used as a}} vitamin K {{source in}} animal feed that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause apoptosis. Here, we examined whether <b>menadione</b> reduces development of preimplantation bovine embryos in a ROS-dependent process and tested the hypothesis that actions of <b>menadione</b> would be reduced by insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1). <b>Menadione</b> caused a concentration-dependent decrease {{in the proportion of}} embryos that became blastocysts. All concentrations tested (1, 2. 5, and 5. 0 mu M) inhibited development. Treatment with 100 ng/ml IGF- 1 reduced the magnitude of the anti-developmental effects of the two lowest <b>menadione</b> concentrations. <b>Menadione</b> also caused a concentration-dependent increase in the percent of cells positive for the TUNEL reaction. The response was lower for IGF- 1 -treated embryos. The effects of <b>menadione</b> were mediated by ROS because (1) the anti-developmental effect of <b>menadione</b> was blocked by the antioxidants dithiothreitol and Trolox and (2) <b>menadione</b> caused an increase in ROS generation. Treatment with IGF- 1 did not reduce ROS formation in menadione-treated embryos. In conclusion, concentrations of <b>menadione</b> as low as 1. 0 mu M can compromise development of bovine preimplantation embryos to the blastocyst stage of development in a ROS-dependent mechanism.

40|$|<b>Menadione,</b> a {{synthetic}} vitamin K 3, exhibits anti-estrogenic activity on in vitro assay. However, the in vivo anti-estrogenic effects of <b>menadione</b> {{have not been}} determined, while correlations between biological effects and structural changes are unclear. Thus, we investigated the in vivo anti-estrogenic activity of <b>menadione</b> under fluorescent light and dark conditions.

40|$|Because cell-mediated {{reduction}} of <b>menadione</b> {{leads to the}} generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), this quinone is widely used to investigate the effects of ROS on cellular functions. We report that A 549 human lung epithelial cells exposed to <b>menadione</b> demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in both intracellular calcium ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) and ROS formation. The concentrations of <b>menadione</b> required to initiate these two events are markedly different, with ROS detection requiring higher levels of <b>menadione.</b> Modulators of antioxidant defences (e. g. buthionine sulphoximine, 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole) have {{little effect on the}} [Ca(2 +) ](i) response to <b>menadione,</b> suggesting that ROS formation does not account for menadione-dependent alterations in [Ca(2 +) ](i). Additional evidence suggests that <b>menadione</b> photochemistry may be responsible for the observed [Ca(2 +) ](i) effects. Specifically: (a) EPR studies with the spin trap 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) show that light exposure (maximum effect at 340 nm) stimulates menadione-dependent formation of the DMPO/(.) OH spin adduct that was not sensitive to antioxidant interventions; (b) DMPO inhibits <b>menadione</b> and light-dependent increases in [Ca(2 +) ](i); and (c) light (maximum effect at 340 nm) augments the deleterious effects of <b>menadione</b> on cell viability as determined by (51) Cr release. These photo effects do not appear to involve formation of singlet oxygen by <b>menadione,</b> but rather are the result of the oxidizing chemistry initiated by <b>menadione</b> in the triplet state. This work demonstrates that <b>menadione</b> species generated by photo-irradiation can exert biological effects on cellular functions and points to the potential importance of photochemistry in studies of menadione-mediated cell damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{reason for}} the {{existence}} of complex sensor kinases is little understood but thought to lie in the capacity to respond to multiple signals. The complex, seven-domain sensor kinase TodS controls in concert with the TodT response regulator the expression of the toluene dioxygenase pathway in Pseudomonas putida F 1 and DOT-T 1 E. We have pre-viously shown that some aromatic hydrocarbons stimulate TodS activity whereas others behave as antagonists. We show here that TodS responds in addition to the oxidative agent <b>menadione.</b> <b>Menadione</b> but no other oxidative agent tested inhib-ited TodS activity in vitro and reduced PtodX expres-sion in vivo. The <b>menadione</b> signal is incorporated by a cysteine-dependent mechanism. The mutation of the sole conserved cysteine of TodS (C 320) ren-dered the protein insensitive to <b>menadione.</b> We eva-luated the mutual opposing effects of toluene and <b>menadione</b> on TodS autophosphorylation. In the presence of toluene, <b>menadione</b> reduced TodS activ-ity whereas toluene did not stimulate activity in the presence of <b>menadione.</b> It was shown by others that <b>menadione</b> increases expression of glucose metabo-lism genes. The opposing effects of <b>menadione</b> on glucose and toluene metabolism may be partially responsible for the interwoven regulation of both catabolic pathways.

Results: When the compared to the control, 10 and 25 µM <b>menadione</b> doses did not shown any activity on glial cell proliferation (p> 0. 05).
