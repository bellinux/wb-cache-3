5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from playing by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 20 {{years of his life}} institutionalised there.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> part of the war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them {{for the duration of the}} hostilities.

He was an early appointee as a Union brigadier general of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen.

This inspired the Lincoln administration to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed Army of Virginia.|$|E

25|$|For <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quarter century, {{the leading}} {{theory of the}} driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale {{convection}} currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere.

However, despite its acceptance, it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static Earth without moving continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.|$|E

25|$|Global {{sea level}} change for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century has {{generally}} been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated {{over long periods of}} time to give a long-term average. More recently, altimeter measurementsnbsp&— in combination with accurately determined satellite orbitsnbsp&— have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change. To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements, scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, marine terraces, ooids in limestones, and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon, with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall. In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, the Predators {{began their}} first postseason series of 2017 on the road.

Two nights later in Game 2, Rinne's 30 saves led to another shutout of the Blackhawks, and goals from Ellis, Fiala, Johansen, Sissons, and Zolnierczyk gave the Predators a 5–0 victory.

25|$|Stafford {{remained}} in England {{for the rest}} of his life, serving King Henry VI. He acted as a bodyguard to the King during Jack Cade's rebellion. He negotiated with the rebels for the government and, when the rebellion was over, helped investigate the causes of the revolt. He acted in a similar capacity when the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled in 1452. As the King became ill, and sank into a coma, the country slid towards civil war. Stafford fought for the King in the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, at St Albans, where they were both captured by the Yorkists. He spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few years of his life attempting to mediate between the Yorkists and the Crown, but partly due to a personal feud with one of the leading Yorkists, Richard, Earl of Warwick, eventually supported King Henry. Stafford was responsible for Richard, Duke of York's defeat in 1459, which drove the latter into exile; but on the rebels' return the next year, the King was attacked at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard, he was killed, and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had predeceased him, so his dukedom descended to his four-year-old grandson, Henry Stafford.|$|E
