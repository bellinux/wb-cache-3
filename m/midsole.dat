5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a <b>midsole</b> of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>midsole</b> is {{the layer}} {{in between the}} outsole and the insole, {{typically}} there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes {{may not have a}} <b>midsole</b> at all.|$|E
25|$|All shoes have a sole, {{which is}} {{the bottom of a}} shoe, in contact with the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, {{although}} most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Soles can be simple— a single material in a single layer— or they can be complex, with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers are used, soles may consist of an insole, <b>midsole,</b> and an outsole.|$|E

50|$|Shox is a shoe feature {{developed}} by Nike and incorporated {{in several of}} their flagship athletic sports shoes. Shox is an array of small hollow columns in the <b>midsoles</b> of the shoe, usually of rubber. There are different formations, but Shox are usually four circular columns in a square formation to provide cushioning. There can also be five or six Shox, 25 mm high, though they may vary in height, and triangular and rectangular Shox that Nike says provide better stability. Some shoes have <b>midsoles</b> made entirely of Shox, like the TL series.|$|R
50|$|These shoes {{also use}} the two-slot cleat {{mounting}} system like casual cycling shoes but have a more aggressive, lugged outsole for better performance when the rider has {{to get off the}} bike to run or to push or carry the bike. Most of these shoes also allow for attachment of two screw-in spikes in the toe area for even more traction in mud or steep trails. The cleats used on mountain bike shoes are also depressed below the treads of the sole, keeping them safe from contact with the ground. Injection-molded nylon <b>midsoles</b> reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber-reinforced injection molded nylon and hand-laid carbon fiber <b>midsoles</b> can be found depending on manufacturer and price range. Prices in the US in 2010 range from $70 to well over $350 for the most expensive models. Sizes are available from 35 to 50, with some companies offering a wider model or two.|$|R
50|$|By {{changing}} the material hardness of the <b>midsole,</b> {{one will be}} able to change the EMG activity in various lower extremity muscles such as rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. Especially when running with the stiffer <b>midsole,</b> the EMG amplitude for tibialis anterior have shown to be significantly greater before the heel strike and lower following the heel strike than compared to the neutral <b>midsole.</b> Furthermore, walking in shoes with stiffer <b>midsole</b> appears to significantly reduce the energy dissipated at the metatarsophalangeal joints and aid in improving jumping performances and running economy. However, the underlying mechanisms that can be attributed to this improvement are still not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|Released in 2008, the Nike Zoom KD {{featured}} a leather upper in a midtop form. The <b>midsole</b> featured Nike Zoom {{unit in the}} forefoot in a cushion <b>midsole.</b> Traction was provided with a solid rubber outsole with flex grooves.|$|E

Night Vision Ventilators were {{designed}} in bright neon hues with mesh and reflective materials. The Heritage collection was inspired by [...] "old industrial place" [...] featuring neutral hues with bright color accents in three different models. The Tonal Ballistic Ventilators featured rugged suede overlays over tonal uppers and contrasting white <b>midsoles.</b> The shoes have been seen on celebrities including French Montana and YG at the 2014 BET Hip Hop Awards.|$|R
50|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of athletic shoe degradation in landfills “are inextricably connected {{to the nature of}} the materials.” The production of many petroleum-based products, such as EVA, used to manufacture athletic shoes result in serious environmental pollution of groundwater and rivers when disposed into landfills. When disposed in landfills, athletic footwear can take up to thousands of years to naturally degrade. EVA athletic shoe <b>midsoles</b> can be kept in contact with moist soil for a period of 12 years and experience little to no evidence of bio deterioration.|$|R
50|$|Aliphatic polyesters are {{a diverse}} family of {{synthetic}} polymers {{of which are}} biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Specifically, poly (lactic acid) has low melt strength and low viscosity properties {{that are similar to}} EVA <b>midsoles</b> in athletic shoes. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is part of the poly (amide-enamine) group and can go through thermoplastic and foaming processes. Along with its good mechanical properties, its popularity is based on the non-toxic products that it becomes when it decomposes through hydrolytic degradation. Hydrolytic degradation of PLA generates the monomer lactic acid, which is metabolized via the tri-carboxylic acid cycle and eliminated as carbon dioxide.|$|R

50|$|With the {{increasing}} number of injuries associated with excessive pronation of the foot, much research has been conducted with different types of <b>midsoles</b> that could possibly aid in prevention of such injuries. The varus-wedged shoes, which have a medial incline, seem to decrease pronation during stance time, reduce the net inversion of the joint moment, and decrease the activities of the inverter muscles, such as tibialis posterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus. The valgus-wedged shoes, which have an lateral incline, are designed to accentuate pronation and have the opposite effect as the varus-wedged shoes. Also when walking in valgus-wedged shoes, it may lead to an increase in calcaneus eversion and up to 58% of energy absorption in the frontal plane of the body.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the difference between genders in body position during jumping movements while wearing shoes with varying <b>midsoles.</b> Twenty-two apparently healthy female and seven males voluntarily participated in this study. Subjects were current or recently graduated NCAA division III athletes of weight bearing sports and familiar with plyometric jumping. Subjects performed plyometric jumps from three box heights (46 cm, 30. 5 cm and 21. 6 cm) while being filmed from both the front and side view. Each jump was completed wearing four different pairs of shoes. The subject was represented as digitized points designed to capture pertinent angles and velocities of the body. Females showed a greater valgus angle than males in all shoe. The Medial Post shoe resulted in subjects having the smallest degree of valgus...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ethylene/Styrene Interpolymers (ESI) {{currently}} under develop-ment by The Dow Chemical Company can be effectively crosslinked using current commercial equipment to produce extruded sheets, bun foams, and injection molded foams (IMF) for footwear parts providing properties that enhance and/or outperform current foams of crosslinked {{ethylene vinyl acetate}} copolymers (EVA). Crosslinked EVA foams with density ranging from 0. 12 to 0. 35 g/cc are becoming increasingly popular in many athletic, ladies high heel, and casual shoes for the fabrication of insoles, <b>midsoles,</b> and unisoles, where light weight, comfort, aesthetics, low cost, and performance are the key. ESIs can be blended with EVA or used pure to give light weight, softer foams with better compression set while maintaining or improving on resiliency, heat shrinkage, and split tear.

Along the medial midfoot, an [...] "H" [...] shaped strap that has two eyelets positioned by column to provide support and lockdown fit. The <b>midsole</b> featured a Nike Zoom forefoot unit encased in lightweight Phylon <b>midsole.</b> The outsole featured a solid rubber outsole with a herringbone pattern. The heel has a cutaway to reveal the Phylon <b>midsole</b> in the outsole for compression. There is a solid rubber wrapped around the heel for durability, but most wearers found it uncomfortable for some reason that when the heel strikes the floor, the foot ends up hitting the rubber piece, which is hard.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies that}} {{controlled}} foot/shoe mass indicate that cushioning provides energetic advantages over running barefoot. Further, running in lightweight shoes has a comparable metabolic cost as running barefoot, suggesting that {{positive effects of}} shoe cushioning may counteract negative mass effects. We hypothesized: 1) unshod running would have comparable metabolic costs as running shod and 2) cushioning will lower the metabolic cost of unshod running. Eleven participants ran at 3. 35 m/s with mid-foot strike patterns unshod and shod (Nike Free 3. 0; 211 g /shoe) on a rigid treadmill. Subjects also ran unshod on 10 mm and 20 mm thick slabs of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foam (same as most running shoe <b>midsoles)</b> mounted on the belt. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production volumes quantified metabolic power. Our findings demonstrate that cushioning reduces the metabolic cost of running, and suggest an ideal amount of cushioning (e. g. 3 ̆c 20 mm) beyond which metabolic benefits diminish...|$|R
40|$|Relatively little {{information}} has been reported about foot and ankle problems experienced by nurses, despite anecdotal evidence which suggests they are common ailments. The {{purpose of this study}} was to improve knowledge about the prevalence of foot and ankle musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and to explore relationships between these MSDs and proposed risk factors. A review of the literature relating to work-related MSDs, MSDs in nursing, foot and lower-limb MSDs, screening for work-related MSDs, foot discomfort, footwear and the prevalence of foot problems in the community was undertaken. Based on the review, theoretical risk factors were proposed that pertained to the individual characteristics of the nurses, their work activity or their work environment. Three studies were then undertaken. A cross-sectional survey of 304 nurses, working in a large tertiary paediatric hospital, established the prevalence of foot and ankle MSDs. The survey collected information about self-reported risk factors of interest. The second study involved the clinical examination of a subgroup of 40 nurses, to examine changes in body discomfort, foot discomfort and postural sway over the course of a single work shift. Objective measurements of additional risk factors, such as individual foot posture (arch index) and the hardness of shoe <b>midsoles,</b> were performed. A final study was used to confirm the test-retest reliability of important aspects of the survey and key clinical measurements. Foot and ankle problems were the most common MSDs experienced by nurses in the preceding seven days (42. 7...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{classification}} {{between different}} gait patterns {{is a frequent}} task in gait assessment. The base vectors were usually found using principal component analysis (PCA) is replaced by an iterative application of the support vector machine (SVM). The aim was to use classifyability instead of variability to build a subspace (SVM space) that contains the information about classifiable aspects of a movement. The first discriminant of the SVM space will be compared to a discriminant found by an independent component analysis (ICA) in the SVM space. Methods: Eleven runners ran using shoes with different <b>midsoles.</b> Kinematic data, representing the movements during stance phase when wearing the two shoes, was used as input to a PCA and SVM. The data space was decomposed by an iterative application of the SVM into orthogonal discriminants that were able to classify the two movements. The orthogonal discriminants spanned a subspace, the SVM space. It represents {{the part of the}} movement that allowed classifying the two conditions. The data in the SVM space was reconstructed for a visual assessment of the movement difference. An ICA was applied to the data in the SVM space to obtain a single discriminant. Cohen’s d effect size was used to rank the PCA vectors {{that could be used to}} classify the data, the first SVM discriminant or the ICA discriminant. Results: The SVM base contains all the information that discriminates the movement of the two shod conditions. It was shown that the SVM base contains some redundancy and a single ICA discriminant was found by applying an ICA in th...|$|R

5000|$|This type of shoe {{generally}} has a soft outsole (as {{compared with a}} road shoe) and a molded internal <b>midsole.</b> They are shaped more like a street or trail shoe with a less exaggerated [...] "rocker" [...] allowing a more normal gait. The outsole usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day hiking boot and is a compromise between an aggressive off shoe and an old-style touring shoe. These shoes have a molded <b>midsole</b> which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can {{be more or less}} walked in normally. There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the outsole where a piece of the outsole material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the <b>midsole</b> and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on.
