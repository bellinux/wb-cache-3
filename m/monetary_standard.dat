It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a <b>monetary</b> <b>standard</b> in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's <b>monetary</b> <b>standard.</b> The gold standard, which the United States had {{effectively}} been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1888, there were rival factions seeking {{control of the}} Republican Party of Ohio. In 1896, one faction was led by Senator John Sherman, former {{governor}} William McKinley, and McKinley's political manager, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. [...] The other grouping was led by former governor Joseph Foraker, who {{had the support of}} Ohio's current governor, Asa S. Bushnell. A truce was reached for the 1896 election campaign whereby McKinley's supporters would vote for Foraker in the Ohio Legislature's January 1896 senatorial election, while Foraker would support McKinley's presidential ambitions. [...] Foraker was elected and in June, the senator-elect placed McKinley's name in nomination at the 1896 Republican National Convention. In the November election, McKinley defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan to win the presidency; Hanna served as his campaign manager and chief fundraiser. The industrialist raised millions for McKinley's campaign but was bitterly attacked by Democratic newspapers for allegedly trying to buy the presidency, with McKinley as his easily dominated agent. [...] In the 1896 election, the issue of the nation's <b>monetary</b> <b>standard</b> was a major issue, with McKinley advocating the gold standard, while Bryan favored [...] "free silver", that is, to inflate the money supply by accepting all silver presented to the government and returning the bullion to the depositor in the form of coin, even though the silver in a dollar coin was worth only about half that.|$|E
500|$|The 1873 act {{eliminated}} the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion {{to have their}} metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. [...] As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. [...] Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more {{on the open market}} in the United States until 1963. [...] Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that [...] "free silver" [...] or bimetallism would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. [...] Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 Bland–Allison Act required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. [...] The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, which {{came to be known as}} the Morgan dollar. [...] The issue of what <b>monetary</b> <b>standard</b> would be used occupied the nation for the rest of the 19th century, becoming most acute in the 1896 presidential election. [...] In that election, [...] the unsuccessful Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan, campaigned on [...] "free silver", having electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech, decrying the gold standard. [...] The issue was settled for the time by the Gold Standard Act of 1900, making that standard the law of the land.|$|E

6000|$|II. The {{change in}} the {{relative}} values of gold and silver finally [...] forced the United States to change their mint ratio in 1834. Two [...] courses were open to us: (1) either to increase the quantity of [...] silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically [...] worth the gold in the gold dollar; or (2) debase the gold [...] dollar-piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the [...] depreciation of silver since 1792. The latter expedient, without [...] any seeming regard to the effect on contracts {{and the integrity of}} [...] our <b>monetary</b> <b>standard,</b> was adopted: 6.589 per cent was taken out [...] of the gold dollar, leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure [...] gold; and as the silver dollar remained unchanged (371-¼ grains) [...] the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988, or, as commonly [...] stated, 1 to 16. Did this correspond with the market ratio then [...] existing? No. Having seen the former steady fall in silver, and [...] believing that it would continue, Congress hoped to anticipate any [...] further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little [...] larger than the market ratio. This was done by establishing the [...] mint ratio of 1 to 15.988, while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to [...] 15.73. Here, again, appeared the difficulty arising from the [...] attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum. It will be seen [...] that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another {{change in the}} [...] coinage—forces of a similar kind, but working in exactly the [...] opposite direction to those previous to 1834. A dollar of gold [...] coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint [...] (15.98) than it would in the form of bullion in the market [...] (15.73). Therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into [...] coin than exchange it as bullion. Gold was sent to the mint, while [...] silver began to be withdrawn from circulation, silver now being [...] more valuable as bullion than as coin. By 1840 a silver dollar was [...] worth 102 cents in gold.(238) This movement, which was displacing [...] silver with gold, received a surprising and unexpected impetus by [...] the gold discoveries of California and Australia in 1849, before [...] mentioned, and made gold less valuable relatively to silver, by [...] lowering the value of gold. Here, again, was another natural [...] cause, independent of legislation, and not to be foreseen, [...] altering the value of one of the precious metals, and in exactly [...] the opposite direction from that in the previous period, when [...] silver was lowered by the increase from the Mexican mines. In 1853 [...] a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold (i.e., of a gold [...] dollar containing 23.22 grains); but, some years before, all [...] silver dollars had disappeared from use, and only gold was in [...] circulation. For a large part of this period we had in reality a [...] single standard of gold, the other metal not being able to stay in [...] the currency.|$|E
