5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E

5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E

It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E
5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis.

5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s {{there were}} a few more Fauré works in the catalogues.

Fauré's music began to appear <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> the record companies' releases in the 1950s. The Record Guide, 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles La bonne chanson and La chanson d'Ève.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|In 1997–98, Mills' Grantham won the Southern League Midland Division title, earning {{promotion}} to the Southern League Premier Division, having led {{the table from}} the start of the season. Grantham also reached the quarter-final of the FA Trophy for only the second time in the club's history. He appeared even <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>in</b> the first team this season, making 50 appearances. However, Mills resigned a week after the season ended in May 1998 as the club's takeover by local businessman Reg Brealey would have meant dismantling the team due to budget cuts. He joined Gresley Rovers of the Southern League Premier Division as a player in July 1998, making his debut in their 0–0 away draw with Bromsgrove Rovers on 22 August. He appeared regularly for Gresley, playing in their first seven matches of 1998–99.|$|E
