The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides.

40|$|Abstract. The current {{available}} <b>microcarriers</b> {{were mainly}} targeted towards pharmaceutical industries, {{and might not}} be suitable for therapeutic implantation. As such, apatite-based <b>microcarriers</b> intended for bone tissue engineering applications would be featured here. Hydroxyapatite-Alginate (HA-Alg) suspension was extruded drop-wise into a calcium chloride (CaCl 2) crosslinking solution. The HA-Alg <b>microcarriers</b> were then sintered to form <b>microcarriers</b> of uniform size. The physicochemical properties were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometery (XRD), and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. Cell viability on these <b>microcarriers</b> was evaluated using human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (hfMSCs). SEM images revealed that sintered apatite-based <b>microcarriers</b> exhibited a rough surface topology with interconnected pores. XRD results showed that these <b>microcarriers</b> remained phase-pure since no other secondary calcium phosphate phases were detected. FTIR analysis indicated several sharp phosphate bands coupled with a hydroxyl band (all belonging to HA). Live/dead staining showed that hfMSCs remained viable after 14 days of culture, and cells have spread and covered the surfaces of the <b>microcarriers.</b> Certainly, these cell-loaded <b>microcarriers</b> could be potentially used in bone implant science...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microcarriers</b> {{have been}} widely used for various {{biotechnology}} applications because of their high scale-up potential, high reproducibility in regulating cellular behavior, and well-documented compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Recently, <b>microcarriers</b> have been emerging as a novel approach for stem cell expansion and differentiation, enabling potential scale-up of stem cell-derived products in large bioreactors. This review summarizes recent advances of using <b>microcarriers</b> in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and pluripotent stem cell (PSC) cultures. From the reported data, efficient expansion and differentiation of stem cells on <b>microcarriers</b> rely on their ability to modulate cell shape (i. e. round or spreading) and cell organization (i. e. aggregate size). Nonetheless, current screening of <b>microcarriers</b> remains empirical, and accurate understanding of how stem cells interact with <b>microcarriers</b> still remains unknown. This review suggests that accurate characterization of biochemical and biomechanical properties of <b>microcarriers</b> is required to fully exploit their potential in regulating stem cell fate decision. Due to the variety of <b>microcarriers,</b> such detailed analyses should lead to the rational design of application-specific <b>microcarriers,</b> enabling the exploitation of reproducible effects for large scale biomedical application...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>microcarriers</b> {{may be used}} for the {{expansion}} of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for cell therapy applications. This study investigated the effects of 10 types of <b>microcarriers</b> on hESC attachment efficiency, growth and pluripotency. High attachment efficiency was observed on uncoated <b>microcarriers,</b> however poor cell growth and/or gradual loss of pluripotency occurred during continuous passaging. Coating of the <b>microcarriers</b> with Matrigel resulted in higher cell yields and stable pluripotent states for at least three passages. Positively charged cylindrical cellulose <b>microcarriers</b> (DE 52, DE 53 and QA 52) and large (190 ?m) positively charged spherical <b>microcarriers</b> (Cytodex 1) exhibited high cell expansion potential and levels of pluripotency. Lower cell yields were obtained using smaller diameter spherical (65 ?m and 10 ?m) or macroporous beads. Instead of Matrigel, laminin coated <b>microcarriers</b> (DE 53 and Cytodex 1) are capable of supporting the long term propagation and pluripotency of HES- 2 and HES- 3 cell lines. HES- 2 cell line which was shown earlier to be shear resistant achieved similar cell growth and expression of pluripotent markers when cultured on both Matrigel (84 % Tra- 1 - 60, 1. 43 × 10 6 cells/ml) and laminin (74 % Tra- 1 - 60, 1. 37 × 10 6 cells/ml) coated <b>microcarriers</b> in spinner flasks. In contrast, HES- 3 exhibited a decrease in cell yield, viability and pluripotent markers on laminin as compared with Matrigel coated <b>microcarriers</b> possibly due to shear sensitivity. Conventional <b>microcarriers</b> intended for propagation of mammalian cells are not suitable for long term propagation of hESC.

Remaining cells stained positive for chondrogenic markers SOX- 9 and S- 100 but extracellular matrix formation was modest to undetectable. In conclusion, the four gelatine <b>microcarriers</b> supported chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation over a two week period. The best yield was observed for <b>microcarriers</b> produced with low emulsifier content and cross-linked in water and acetone. These results add to the identification of optimal biomaterial parameters for specific cellular processes and populations.
