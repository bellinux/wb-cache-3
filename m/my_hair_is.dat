25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, she said, and while <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> busy, my mind stays idle. I {{am afraid that}} my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my {{headache}} afterwards. The Empress {{sat at a table}} which was moved {{to the middle of the}} room and covered with a white cloth. She was shrouded in a white, laced peignoir, her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.|$|E
500|$|This highly nuanced {{and largely}} {{theatrical}} letter was unsigned, {{but she had}} included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they joggle the Mind".|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. <b>My</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E
2500|$|ASL {{does not}} have a copula (linking 'to be' verb). [...] For example, <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> wet is signed 'my hair wet', and my name is Pete may be signed 'TOPIC P-E-T-E'.|$|E
2500|$|Of mixed {{race with}} African and European ancestry on both sides, White had {{features}} showing the latter. He emphasized in his autobiography, A Man Called White (p.3): [...] "I am a Negro. My skin is white, {{my eyes are}} blue, <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> blond. The traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me." [...] Of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents, only five were black, and the other 27 were white. All members of his immediate family had fair skin, and his mother, Madeline, was also blue-eyed and blonde. The oral history of his mother's family is that her maternal grandparents were Dilsia, a slave and concubine, and her master, William Henry Harrison. Harrison had six children with Dilsia and, much later, {{was elected president of}} the United States. Madeline's mother, Marie Harrison, was one of Dilsia's daughters by Harrison. Held as a slave in La Grange, Georgia, where she had been sold, Marie became a concubine to Augustus Ware. The wealthy white man bought her a house, had four children with her, and passed on some wealth to them. White and his family identified as Negro and lived among Atlanta's Negro community.|$|E

2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E

2500|$|The taping {{was done}} in {{sequence}} and there were rarely any retakes because the producers were strict. Priscilla Barnes once said, [...] "Our bosses were very, very controlling. If <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> too blonde, I'd get called up in the office." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} blacker and more silent than ever. The same feeling of {{apprehension}} which had lain heavily upon {{me at the}} beginning of the séance was back at my heart once more. The roots of <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>were</b> tingling.|$|R

6000|$|... "You are {{a little}} ashamed, as it is," [...] Ralph laughed. [...] "We had not {{intended}} {{to come out in}} our new character, so soon; but when <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> once done, you see, it was impossible to go about in uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} {{tell the whole}} truth," [...] objected Anne. [...] "You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth. Now, you've told me a dozen times that <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> red, but you've never {{once told me that}} I had a nice nose." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Everybody {{will think}} that I am setting myself to captivate Mr. Boldwood, I suppose," [...] she murmured. [...] "At least they'll say so.

60|$|It missed me by a fraction, but <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> turning grey Before {{they called}} the drivers up arid dragged the brute away. Then I sought the City Elders, and my words were very plain. They flushed that four-foot drain-head and--it never choked again.|$|R
5000|$|... "Boston Square" [...] {{is about}} {{a good friend of}} James Veck-Gilodi's called Phil who {{committed}} suicide.

60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [placidly]. A {{good deal}} of <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> quite genuine. The Duchess of Dithering offered me fifty guineas for this [touching her forehead] under the {{impression}} that it was a transformation; but it is all natural except the color.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{somewhat}} luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.|$|E
5000|$|Sunshine (Ronnie) was {{far from}} being the only one with long hair at the time. Even Gerry (Ryan Hurst) had long hair.

5000|$|The band {{released}} {{a trio of}} albums in the 1970s. Their first release, on Mercury Records, was 1971's First Stop, credited to [...] "Gun Hill Road." [...] The second album, Gunhill Road, was released in 1972 and produced by Kenny Rogers. In 1973, three songs were re-recorded and the album was re-released, after which [...] "Back When <b>My</b> <b>Hair</b> <b>was</b> Short" [...] became a national hit. The 1972 versions of [...] "Back When <b>My</b> <b>Hair</b> <b>was</b> Short" [...] and [...] "42nd Street" [...] had some drug references, while the 1973 re-recordings had some lyric changes and a more up-tempo feel. The album received great reviews, and was often featured on many FM and college radio stations [...] According to Billboard, [...] "Back When <b>My</b> <b>Hair</b> Was Short" [...] had the distinction in 1973 of being top 10 in more different markets at more different times than any other record of that year.|$|R
