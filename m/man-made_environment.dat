25|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall {{goal is to}} make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake {{engineering is}} the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the <b>man-made</b> <b>environment</b> from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|E
500|$|During development, Rain World {{animations}} {{became popular}} {{on social media}} for their [...] "uncanny fluidity", which reviewers continued to praise at release. IGN described Slugcat's animations as beautiful and reactive to the angle and physics of movement, from clinging to poles to squeezing through ventilation. The reviewer said it was among the best aesthetics in a 2D game, with each screen showing abundant detail and meticulous craft. The graphics were more interesting than beautiful to Polygon reviewer, who also praised the limited color palette's role in distinguishing the Slugcat, prey, and enemies from the environment. While some journalists compared the game's aesthetic to that of Limbo, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer felt that Rain World had {{more in common with}} [...] aesthetic: both featured similarly dark yet attractive worlds, scary yet fascinating characters, frequent inter-enemy conflict, and frustrating or masochistic controls. Oddworld, though, had more frequent saves. Rain World successfully depicted [...] "the cruel indifference of nature", according to GameSpot. Its imaginative and compelling landscapesurreal inhabitants in a bleak, alien atmosphererecalled the spirit of games like BioShock and Abzû, in which the reviewer was too attracted to the artistic detail to contemplate the credulity of the <b>man-made</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{satellite}} medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a <b>man-made</b> <b>environment,</b> which [...] "ends 'Nature' {{and turns}} the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed." [...] All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term global theater.

2500|$|In Fall 1971 McCoy {{began her}} career in design {{education}} when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband Michael McCoy. [...] While McCoy led the graphic design program, and Michael McCoy led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing. Katherine describes combining the [...] "objective" [...] typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience {{with an interest in}} the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late '60s when creating and reinventing the program. Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were Robert Venturi's book Learning from Las Vegas, Richard Saul Wurman's publishing on the <b>man-made</b> <b>environment,</b> and McCoy's own interest in social design and design vernacular. The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the Basel experiments of Wolfgang Weingart and a Yale project by Dan Friedman were visual design influences. Later sources included semiotics, post-structuralism, literary theory and deconstruction; both the students' and McCoy's work experimented with applications of these ideas to communications design. Katherine designed many projects for the Cranbrook Educational Community including quarterly magazines, art catalogs, Art Academy departmental posters and museum exhibitions that she and Michael produced as McCoy & McCoy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that Smart's work {{comments}} on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, 'off-beat classicalist' and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart's paintings as portraying 'Orwellian gloom' – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell's literary political masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four. James Gleeson believes that Smart's paintings are [...] "too real to be real"; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life {{are nothing more than}} superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, <b>man-made</b> <b>environment.</b> It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart's artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: [...] "an artist has to be moved to move his viewers", and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – not concerned with your typical Australian landscape. [...] "I like living in the 20th century – to me the world has never been more beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can with my own eyes... It's obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it.... to me composition is everything". Smart believed that people should view art with their eyes and not their head.|$|E

40|$|<b>Man-made</b> <b>environments</b> posses {{a lot of}} regularities which simplify {{otherwise}} difficult pose estimation {{and visual}} reconstruction tasks. The constraints arising from parallel and orthogonal lines and planes can be efficiently exploited at various stages of vision processing pipeline. In this paper we propose an approach for estimation of vanishing points by exploiting the constraints of structured <b>man-made</b> <b>environments,</b> {{where the majority of}} lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We combine efficient image processing techniques used in the line detection and initialization stage with simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Since we assume uncalibrated camera the estimated vanishing points can be used towards partial camera calibration and estimation of the relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene. The presented approach is computationally efficient and has been verified extensively by experiments. Key words: Vanishing point estimation, relative orientation, calibration using vanishing points, vision guided mobile and aerial robots. ...|$|R
