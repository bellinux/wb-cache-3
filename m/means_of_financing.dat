The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state's spending and borrowing led to short-term budget problems, but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold {{because of lack of}} funds), the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana's population grew from sixty-five thousand in 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.|$|E

25|$|From 1972 to 1975, Coombs {{served as}} a {{consultant}} to Prime Minister Whitlam, but his influence was resented by other ministers. He found the experience of the first Labor government since 1949 disappointing. He disapproved of the events that led up to the Loans Affair of 1975 and the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which led to the dismissal of Whitlam's government by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. He advised Whitlam not to resort to unorthodox <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> government operations when the Senate blocked supply, but Whitlam did so anyway. Although he regarded the dismissal as scandalous, his estrangement from Whitlam meant that he took little subsequent part in politics. In 1975, he was chairman of a Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which was tasked with examining the purpose, functions, organisation and management of Australian Government bodies and the structure and management of the Australian Public Service. Nevertheless, the Royal Commission report was largely ignored by the incoming Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser.|$|E
500|$|Early in the war, the Confederacy relied {{mostly on}} tariffs on imports and taxes on exports. However, with the {{imposition}} of a voluntary self-embargo in 1861 (intended to [...] "starve" [...] Europe of cotton and force diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy), as well as the blockade of Southern ports enforced by the Union Navy, the revenue from taxes on international trade became smaller and smaller. Likewise, the financing obtained through early voluntary donations of coins and bullion from private individuals in support of the Confederate cause, which early on were quite substantial, dried up by the end of 1861. As a result, the Confederate government was forced to resort to other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> its military operations. A [...] "war-tax" [...] was enacted but proved difficult to collect. Likewise, the appropriation of Union property in the South and the forced repudiation of debts owned by Southerners to Northerners failed to raise substantial revenue. The subsequent issuance of government debt and substantial printing of the Confederate dollars contributed to high inflation which plagued the Confederacy {{until the end of the}} war, although the military setbacks in the field also played a role by causing loss of confidence and fueling inflationary expectations.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Farmer cooperatives {{have often}} {{maintained}} inflexible capital structures which severely restrict members' freedom to allocate their own capital {{in a most}} profitable manner. This {{study was conducted to}} provide insights into how cooperative finance programs might be modified to provide increased capital and, at the same time, be more acceptable to members. The revolving equity certificate <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> was examined in depth. Of particular interest was the option of certificate transferability which would allow "capital-short" certificate holders the opportunity to reallocate at least a part of their investment in the cooperative association to more preferred investments on their own farms. An anlysis was designed to determine which types of farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, would be most likely to 1) possess the highest opportunity costs for capital investments on their farms and 2) buy and/or sell revolving equity certificates at some discounted present value of the certificates' specified face amounts. Cooperative member and nonmember preferences for selected <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> were also examined. The acceptability of alternatives such as long-term interest-bearing notes, stock certificates, revolving equity certificates, and high member ship fees was rated by the farmers in the sample. Conclusions were then reached regarding the general acceptability among farmers <b>of</b> selected <b>means</b> <b>of</b> cooperative <b>finance.</b> Several groups <b>of</b> farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, expressed a desire to participate in a market for transferable revolving equity certificates. It was concluded that transferability of certificates would provide an opportunity for many farmers to allocate their own capital in a more profitable fashion. Examination of the potential buyer-side of the equity certificate market revealed a relatively thin participation except at high rates of discount. In general, cooperatives could better serve their memberships by carefully planning their alternative <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> with. special consideration of those alternatives which would allow the members a reasonable degree of investment flexibility...|$|R

2500|$|The Federal City Council {{was active}} {{on a much}} wider range of {{infrastructure}} initiatives. [...] It advocated in 2012 creation of a public-private investment trust fund to help rebuild and improve the city's parks, public transit system, and sewer system. It established an internal task force to identify new <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> bridge improvement, repair, and replacement; a new city jail; and improvements to city-owned golf courses. In 2013, the organization announced {{the creation of the}} Anacostia Waterfront Trust to coordinate regional efforts to end the continuing pollution of the Anacostia River and to begin cleanup efforts of the riverbed. Doug Siglin, formerly the federal affairs director for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, was named executive director of the Trust. The Federal City Council agreed to back a multibillion-dollar federal plan to end raw sewage flows into the river; mitigation of greywater, surface runoff, and urban runoff into the river; and research into the best way to address the deep deposits of dangerous contaminants on the river bottom. As part of its Anacostia River initiative, the council supported legislation (enacted in 2014) banning the use of polystyrene foam containers for use by food carryout providers. It also continued work to preserve and improve Union Station, and worked closely with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, Amtrak, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and local real estate developer Akridge to begin work on Burnham Place—a $1.5 billion mixed-use development that will build a new passenger terminal and retail, residential, and office buildings over the tracks (while adding a large parking garage beneath the tracks). This included studying the infrastructure and architectural/engineering aspects of Union Station and identifying as many sources for funding and financing as possible. From 2010 to 2015, the Federal City Council remained largely quiet on issues facing Metro and DC Streetcar, however. However, the organization did undertake a study of Metro in 2015 which led to a November 2016 report that called for a federal takeover of the transit agency if its three state-level partners did not agree to radically reconstitute Metro's governance structure. The report called for Metro's board to be drastically reduced in number and to be composed of transit professionals rather than political appointees. It also called for weaker protections for Metro's trade unions, and for each state-level partner to adopt a dedicated tax to support Metro's capital needs and operations. The Federal City Council said it would attempt to build a coalition, consisting primarily of the region's largest employers and businesses with the most revenue, to support the changes. Within two weeks, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the Greater Washington Board of Trade had signed on to the proposals. The state of Virginia agreed to back the idea of a smaller, more professional board.|$|E

30|$|In Table  5, we {{assessed}} {{the association between}} self-employment intention with demographic and socio-economic characteristics using chi-square test.

Meanwhile, gender, age, educational background of parents, place of birth, marital status, place of study, ethnicity, economic status of the household, religion, and field of study {{do not have any}} significant association with self-employment intention at 5 % level of significance. For instance, students placed on different department (field of study) and university (place of study) do not have significant variation on self-employment intention. The chi-square test in Table  5 also shows that males do not have higher tendency to engage in self-employment activities than females and vice versa. It means that there is no significant difference between male and female on self-employment intention. In conclusion, H 3 : demographic factors such as gender, age, and marital status are associated with self-employment intention is not supported.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-country micro-theoretic model {{consistent with the}} Ricardian equivalence hypothesis.

An unconstrained vector autoregression shows some patterns in the recent U. S. data that appear to be inconsistent with the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis.
