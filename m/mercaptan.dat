50|$|Processes within oil {{refineries}} or natural gas processing plants that remove <b>mercaptans</b> and/or hydrogen sulfide are {{commonly referred to}} as sweetening processes because they result in products which no longer have the sour, foul odors of <b>mercaptans</b> and hydrogen sulfide.|$|R

5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl <b>mercaptan,</b> a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl <b>mercaptan,</b> a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
25|$|DMSO {{disposed}} into sewers {{can also}} cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless {{because of the lack}} of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (<b>mercaptan)</b> linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.|$|E

25|$|Mercaptans (thiols) are {{produced}} in wine by {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the lees. This can be prevented by racking the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 µg/L, with levels above causing onion, rubber, and skunk type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl <b>mercaptan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of flatus comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl <b>mercaptan,</b> MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E
25|$|Lead is a {{soft metal}} (MH 1.5, but hardens close to melting) which, in many cases, {{is unable to}} support its own weight. It has a {{close-packed}} structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that {{has been attributed to}} partial ionisation of the lead atoms. It forms a semi-covalent dioxide PbO2; a covalently bonded sulfide PbS; covalently bonded halides; and a range of covalently bonded organolead compounds such as the lead(II) <b>mercaptan</b> Pb(SC2H5)2, lead tetra-acetate Pb(CH3CO2)4, and the once common, anti-knock additive, tetra-ethyl lead (CH3CH2)4Pb. The oxide of lead in its preferred oxidation state (PbO; +2) is amphoteric; it forms anionic plumbates in strongly basic solutions. Lead forms Zintl phases such as CsPb, Sr31Pb20, La5Pb3N and Yb3Pb20. It has reasonable to good corrosion resistance; in moist air it forms a mixed gray coating of oxide, carbonate and sulfate that hinders further oxidation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} assist in {{detecting}} leaks, an odorizer {{is added to the}} otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas used by consumers.

Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry. [...] This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNatural gas always {{contains}} contaminants such as acid gases (CO 2 and H 2 S), <b>mercaptans</b> {{and other}} sulfur components. With {{the purpose of}} avoiding corrosion when water is present, safety problems and environmental issues, these impurities must be removed until an acceptable specification. According to Huguet et al. [1], the treated gas contains as maximum as 2 % CO 2, 2 – 4 ppm H 2 S and 5 – 30 ppm total sulfur (<b>mercaptans</b> and COS). Absorption with alkanolamines processes are commonly used for natural gas treatment. The knowledge of the <b>mercaptans</b> solubility in aqueous alkanolamine solutions is important in acid gas removal process simulation and design, as it allows designers to confirm their regulatory limits. In previous works done at CTP, the activity coefficients at infinite dilution and Henry's law constant of <b>mercaptans</b> [2] have been determined by using gas stripping method; the solubilities of n-Propyl-mercaptan, n-Butyl-mercaptan and Dimethylsulfide in loaded, and unloaded MDEA and DEA aqueous solutions [3] were measured by using static analytic method. In this work, we report the results of Vapor Liquid Equilibrium measurements of different <b>mercaptans</b> (methyl-and ethyl-mercaptan) in different alkanolamine solutions of MDEA. Thermodynamic models are crucial for acid gas removal process simulation and design. The association effects of water and alkanolamine have the most important role in these systems.

In previous work [5], CPA EoS was successfully applied to describe the phase equilibria of alkane-alkanolamine-water ternary systems.
