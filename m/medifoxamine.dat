50|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> {{has been}} found to act {{preferentially}} as a relatively weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but also as an even weaker serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 1500 nM) and as a weak antagonist of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (IC50 = 950 and 980, respectively; notably greater affinity relative to amitriptyline and imipramine). It is known to produce two active metabolites during first-pass metabolism in the liver, CRE-10086 (N-methyl-2,2-diphenoxyethylamine) and CRE-10357 (N,N-dimethyl-2-hydroxyphenoxy-2-phenoxyethylamine). The IC50 values of CRE-10086 for serotonin transporter, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C binding are 450 nM, 330 nM, and 700 nM, respectively, while those of CRE-10357 are 660 nM, 1600 nM, and 6300 nM. <b>Medifoxamine</b> and its metabolites lack affinity for other serotonin receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT3 (>10000 nM). As <b>medifoxamine</b> is metabolized extensively in the liver during first-pass metabolism, and as these metabolites have as much as 3-fold greater activity relative to <b>medifoxamine,</b> it is likely that they contribute significantly to the pharmacology of the parent drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> (INN) (brand names Clédial, Gerdaxyl) or <b>medifoxamine</b> fumarate, {{also known}} as N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenoxyethylamine, is an {{atypical}} antidepressant with additional anxiolytic properties acting via dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms that was formerly marketed in France and Spain, as well as Morocco. The drug was first introduced in France sometime around 1990. It was withdrawn from the market in 1999 (Morocco) and 2000 (France) following incidences of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> could {{technically}} be said {{to belong}} to this group, {{as it is a}} serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many {{tricyclic}} antidepressants, <b>medifoxamine</b> lacks anticholinergic and alpha blocker properties (very low {{affinity for}} the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and 10-fold lower {{affinity for the}} α1-adrenergic receptor relative to 5-HT2 binding sites), and is also apparently inactive as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (although the same source stating this also states that it is inactive as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which was subsequently found {{not to be the}} case). Studies in mice revealed that the drug does not possess any sedative or locomotor stimulant effects. In accordance with all of the preceding, <b>medifoxamine</b> was found to be well-tolerated at dosages of 100-300 mg per day in clinical trials. Double-blind controlled clinical studies have found it to have similar effectiveness to imipramine, clomipramine, and maprotiline in the treatment of depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> (Cledial, Gerdaxyl) is an {{antidepressant}} {{that appears}} {{to act as an}} SDRI as well as a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Sibutramine (Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, Sibutrex) is a withdrawn anorectic that itself as a molecule in vitro is an SNDRI but preferentially an SDRI, with 18.3- and 5.8-fold preference for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine over norepinephrine, respectively. However, the metabolites of sibutramine are substantially more potent and possess different ratios of monoamine reuptake inhibition in comparison, and sibutramine appears to be acting in vivo mainly as a prodrug to them; accordingly, it was found to act as an SNRI (73% and 54% for norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, respectively) in human volunteers with only very weak inhibition of dopamine reuptake (16%).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, <b>medifoxamine,</b> mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> {{is a new}} monoamine re-uptake {{inhibiting}} antidepressant drug. Twelve volunteers received 100 mg by i. v. infusion over 15 min and 500 mg by mouth fasting.

Venous blood samples (10 ml) were taken at intervals for 24 h for h. p. l. c. measurement of serum <b>medifoxamine.</b> A biexponential decline of serum <b>medifoxamine</b> concentration was observed after intravenous administration in all subjects and similar terminal elimination half-lives were observed following both routes, indicating that oral absorption is not rate-limiting.

40|$|<b>Medifoxamine</b> {{is a novel}} monoamine re-uptake {{inhibiting}} antidepressive drug which preferentially inhibits dopamine reuptake. In human volunteer studies it {{has been}} found to reduce significantly intraocular pressure after single oral doses of 300 - 1000 mg, and to produce a small but statistically significant miosis. Its maximal ocular hypotensive action was less than that of oral timolol 20 mg...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and psychomotor {{effects of}} <b>medifoxamine,</b> a 5 HT reuptake inhibitory antidepressant, were studied in healthy elderly volunteers after single and multiple dosing. The elimination half life (t 1 / 2 z) after single doses of 300 mg was 2. 8 h [...] {{almost identical to}} that found in young volunteers. After seven days of dosing at 100 mg three times daily the mean corrected AUC after 300 mg significantly increased from 1. 04 to 1. 34 mg. h. l- 1 and t 1 / 2 z increased to 4. 0 h (NS). There were no significant changes in critical flicker fusion frequency, symbol digit substitution, continuous attention or choice reaction times...|$|E
