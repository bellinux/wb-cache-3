5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{want to live in}} the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres {{may be associated with}} hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{features}} more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer, however, decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear in the ride at all. In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it has replaced, The Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd.|$|E

25|$|This forced diet has {{affected}} the iguanas' ability to reproduce. As reproductive females are not being provided with enough nutrition to produce eggs and support their own metabolism; <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> survive after laying eggs, resulting in the present skewed sex ratio of 2 males to every female. Females usually lay one clutch of about 12-16 eggs per year in late spring or early summer.|$|E

25|$|Adoption gives many {{children}} great opportunities {{that they may}} have never otherwise received. Such opportunities include loving homes and environments, parents who are able to provide and care for all their financial needs as well as access to education.

25|$|Some {{alternatives}} to dissection may present educational advantages {{over the use}} of animal cadavers, while eliminating the problematic ethical issues. These alternatives include computer programs, lectures, three dimensional models, films, and other forms of technology. Concern for animal welfare is often at the root of objections to animal dissection. Studies show that some students reluctantly participate in animal dissection out of fear of real or perceived punishment or ostracism from their teachers and peers, and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> speak up about their ethical objections.|$|E
50|$|At the time, {{the average}} Argentine <b>did</b> <b>not</b> employ {{the banking system}} for daily uses; <b>many</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have a {{personal}} bank account, and dealt only with cash.

25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. <b>Many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> select their treatment and control groups randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{separate}} ethnic Korean community {{on the island of}} Sakhalin, typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans. Some may identify as Koryo-saram, but <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>not.</b> Unlike the communities on the Russian mainland, which consist mostly of immigrants from the late 19th century and early 20th century, the ancestors of the Sakhalin Koreans came as immigrants from Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces in the late 1930s and early 1940s, forced into service by the Japanese government to work in coal mines in Sakhalin (then known as Karafuto Prefecture) in order to fill labour shortages caused by World War II.|$|E
