5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of <b>mitosis.</b> However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of <b>mitosis</b> and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed <b>mitosis,</b> in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed <b>mitosis,</b> the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open <b>mitosis,</b> which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of <b>mitosis,</b> she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of <b>mitosis,</b> the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next <b>mitosis,</b> and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{argues for}} the need to study cells with {{physical}} methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. He notes that in <b>mitosis</b> the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.|$|E
5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed <b>mitosis</b> with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E
5|$|Sebum is {{produced}} in a holocrine process, in which cells within the sebaceous gland rupture and disintegrate as they release the sebum and the cell remnants are secreted together with the sebum. The cells are constantly replaced by <b>mitosis</b> {{at the base of}} the duct.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{contact with}} fish hosts and firing {{of the polar}} capsules, the sporoplasm {{contained}} within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes <b>mitosis</b> to produce more amoeboid cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, to reach the cerebral cartilage.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} <b>mitosis</b> in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through <b>mitosis,</b> into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in <b>mitosis.</b> Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope's {{structure}} {{is determined by}} a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus. The nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in {{the disintegration of the}} nuclear envelope during <b>mitosis</b> and its reassembly {{at the end of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} <b>mitosis</b> in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.occidentalis is Molliardiomyces occidentalis, described by John W. Paden. This form produces smooth, colorless conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia) measuring 20–230 by 2–3.2µm. The conidia are roughly spherical to , smooth, translucent (hyaline), and 4.6–7.0 by 3.0–3.8µm.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in <b>mitosis.</b> Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid <b>mitosis</b> and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during <b>mitosis</b> and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open <b>mitosis,</b> the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of <b>mitosis,</b> showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by <b>mitosis</b> and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitosis</b> and meiosis are {{types of}} cell division. <b>Mitosis</b> occurs in somatic cells, while meiosis occurs in gametes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mitosis</b> {{promoting}} factor MPF also regulates DNA-damage induced apoptosis. Negative {{regulation of}} MPF by WEE1 causes aberrant <b>mitosis</b> and thus resistance to DNA-damage induced apoptosis. Kruppel-like factor2 (KLF2) negatively regulates human WEE1, thus increasing sensitivity to DNA-damage induced apoptosis in cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mitosis</b> is {{the process}} by which a {{eukaryotic}} cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two nuclei. During the process of <b>mitosis</b> the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Reproduction by cell {{division}} (binary fission, <b>mitosis</b> or meiosis).|$|E
25|$|Grade 3 tumors meet two criteria, usually nuclear atypia and <b>mitosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} {{paclitaxel}} to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics, but {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block <b>mitosis.</b> At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during <b>mitosis.</b> Paclitaxel binds to beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules.|$|E
25|$|Higher-level DNA {{packaging}} of the 30nm fibre {{into the}} metaphase chromosome (during <b>mitosis</b> and meiosis).|$|E
25|$|During <b>mitosis,</b> lamins are {{phosphorylated}} by MPF, which {{drives the}} disassembly of the lamina {{and the nuclear}} envelope.|$|E
25|$|In {{the broad}} sense, most {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs work by impairing <b>mitosis</b> (cell division), effectively targeting fast-dividing cells. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed cytotoxic. They prevent <b>mitosis</b> by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division. One theory {{as to why}} these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Telomerase replaces short bits of DNA {{known as}} telomeres, which are {{otherwise}} shortened when a cell divides via <b>mitosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Amon lab {{primarily}} investigates yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a {{model for}} understanding the controls that govern cell-cycle progression. As a Whitehead Fellow, her team discovered that CDC20 plays a crucial role in cell division. Her Whitehead team identified an interaction between phosphatase and CDC14 which initiates the exit of cells from <b>mitosis</b> to the G1 phase. Amon's team demonstrated that CDC20 is the target protein in the spindle checkpoint during <b>mitosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glial {{cells are}} known to be capable of <b>mitosis.</b> By contrast, {{scientific}} understanding of whether neurons are permanently post-mitotic, or capable of <b>mitosis,</b> is still developing. In the past, glia had been considered to lack certain features of neurons. For example, glial cells were not believed to have chemical synapses or to release transmitters. They were considered to be the passive bystanders of neural transmission. However, recent studies have shown this to be untrue.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>mitosis</b> {{is complex and}} highly regulated. The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of <b>mitosis</b> the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in cytokinesis, to produce two identical daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|G2 phase occurs after DNA {{replication}} and is {{a period}} of protein synthesis and rapid cell growth to prepare the cell for <b>mitosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chromosome {{shattering}} is triggered and reassembly of chromosome fragments {{in close}} proximity is caused by environmental stimuli such as high energy ionising radiation encountered during <b>mitosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stochastic differentiation: {{when one}} stem cell {{develops}} into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes <b>mitosis</b> and produces two stem cells {{identical to the}} original.|$|E
25|$|Interphase {{proceeds}} {{in three}} stages, G1, S, and G2, {{followed by the}} cycle of <b>mitosis</b> and cytokinesis. The cell's nuclear DNA contents are duplicated during S phase.|$|E
25|$|DNA replication, or {{the process}} of {{duplicating}} a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through <b>mitosis</b> or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{resultant}} {{number of}} cells in <b>mitosis</b> is {{twice the number of}} original cells. The number of chromosomes in the offspring cells is {{the same as that of}} the parent cell.|$|E
