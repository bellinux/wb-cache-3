50|$|Mortgage burning is a twentieth-century American custom that is {{the ritual}} burning of a paid off <b>mortgage</b> <b>document</b> by homeowners. It is done as a celebratory event, and is {{sometimes}} accompanied by a party in which extended family and friends are invited.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, Bishop S. Arthur Huston reopened {{discussions with}} the parish's bankers in St. Louis, Missouri; {{over the next three}} years, more funds were raised, and in 1947 the {{mortgage}} was paid off. The <b>mortgage</b> <b>document</b> was burned before the Parish on Palm Sunday.|$|E
50|$|The court {{dismissed}} the non est factum plea, {{as she was}} not misled into signing the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> but instead she was careless in signing them.|$|R
50|$|As she {{was short}} in time, {{and in a}} hurry to make the later appointment, she signed the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> without first {{referring}} them to her solicitor for legal advice.|$|R
50|$|Mrs Jenkins {{claimed the}} {{mortgage}} was unenforceable, pleading non est factum {{as she did}} not take legal advice before signing the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> and did not realize {{the nature of the}} mortgage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{report also}} {{described}} a <b>mortgage</b> <b>document</b> {{for the house}} in Johnston, outside his district, which stated Carnevale [...] "agrees to occupy the property as his principal residence within sixty days", signed in 2007.

50|$|In a ship mortgage, a {{shipowner}} gives {{a lender}} (or mortgagee) {{an interest in}} a ship as security for a loan. Similar to other types of mortgage, a ship mortgage legally consists of three parts: the mortgage loan, the <b>mortgage</b> <b>document</b> (deed) and the rights derived from the mortgage deed onto money lender. Ship mortgages differ from other types of mortgage in three ways. First, some privileged claims could have a higher ranking over that of mortgagee against the ship. Second, ships naturally move between jurisdictions. And third, a ship is always at risk of partial or total damages at sea. The use of ship mortgages emerged as a widely accepted practice in shipping industry in the 19th century as {{a major source of}} finance for ship owners.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{subject-matter}} {{of cargo}} and ship mortgage are similar (providing financial security for creditors),the regulations of these contracts, differ {{from each other}} essentially {{with regard to the}} conditionality of taking possession in concluding the contract, the possibility of endorsement and cession in <b>mortgage</b> <b>document,</b> the creditor s kind of real right,the preference of prior or latter creditor in vindication of right and the effect of mortgage loss on the contract and the possibility of recovery of claim. Moreover the cargo mortgage regulations are, in some regards and aspects, contrary to general legal rules and hence subject to criticism...|$|E
50|$|When {{it came to}} {{sign the}} <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> Robert's {{solicitor}} refused to be party to the transaction, and Robert {{decided to use the}} law firm of Clark Boyce, whom were also his mother's solicitors.|$|R
50|$|Clarke Boyce {{informed}} Mrs Mouat 3 {{times that}} she should obtain independent advice, which she declined to do. In the end they got her to sign a form confirming that she refused to seek legal advice, and the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> were duly signed.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1970, Fannie Mae was {{authorized}} by the United States Government to purchase residential mortgage loans. Fannie Mae worked with Freddie Mac to develop uniform <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> and national standards for what would {{come to be known}} as a conforming loan.|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of “certainty” and “autonomy” {{are central to}} the Torrens system and contract law respectively. Courts seek to resolve conflict between these principles. Systemic incoherence is especially apparent when courts consider the all-obligations mortgage. The <b>mortgage</b> <b>document</b> does not only place a charge on title. It secures personal obligations also. Registration may or may not extend to these obligations. According to the laws of contract, these personal obligations are established by the substance {{of the relationship between the}} parties, illustrated by a structure of legal forms via the contract. Registration then purports to "animate” the contract through the legal form of "title/interest by registration”. Hence the title of this paper: the "Frankenstein Mortgage". The Torrens system requires jurisdictions to engage in a perpetual search for coherence. An awareness of the ideological disunion underlying the law of real property enables judges to subduct concepts in a congruent manner and achieve a semblance of a unified legal form. Rather than etiolating the Torrens principle of certainty through policy-based rationales, reforms require an examination of residuary common law principles and conceptual sources of law, combined with a consciousness of the illogical nature of lawmaking that must, to maximize practical efficacy, provide a compromise between the two systems...|$|E
50|$|Former {{employees}} from Ameriquest, which was United States' leading wholesale lender, described {{a system in}} which they were pushed to falsify <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits. There is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis.|$|R

5000|$|The Registry of Deeds {{has since}} 1708 {{dealt with the}} {{registration}} of wills, title deeds, <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> and other documentation concerning granting of title over land. It was originally set up to enforce the legislation regarding ownership of land by Catholics. A registered deed took precedence over an unregistered deed. Original deeds and their schedules were not retained by the registry, but rather detailed summaries (called [...] "memorials") of conveyancing and <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> are stamped and filed by the registrar. These documents are generally signed {{by at least one}} of the parties and one of the witnesses of the deeds. No certificates or guarantees of title are issued: the registry merely endeavours to provide information concerning the deeds lodged against a certain property — and, crucially, the order in which they were lodged — such as the last named owner or the latest mortgage to be lodged.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{mortgage}} {{has been approved}} and the borrowers have signed their <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> a Verbal Verification of Employment (Form 90) is conducted with all current employers prior to funding the loan. This is done {{to ensure that the}} borrower has not stopped working since the application was submitted, which would influence the terms on which the loan was approved.|$|R
500|$|In April 2007, Nicolas Cage {{bought the}} LaLaurie House through Hancock Park Real Estate Company, LLC, for a sum of $3.45 million. [...] The <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> were {{arranged}} {{in such a}} way that Cage's name did not appear on them. On November 13, 2009, the property, then valued at $3.5 million, was listed for auction as a result of bank foreclosure and purchased by Regions Financial Corporation for $2.3 million.|$|R
50|$|The {{mortgage}} holder {{can usually}} initiate foreclosure {{at a time}} specified in the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> typically {{some period of time}} after a default condition occurs. Within the United States, Canada and many other countries, several types of foreclosure exist. In the U.S., two of them - namely, by judicial sale and by power of sale - are widely used, but other modes of foreclosure are also possible in a few states.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{vital records}} such as birth certificates, death certificates, and {{frequently}} marriage certificates are {{maintained by the}} Office of Vital Statistics or Office of Vital Records in each individual state.

2500|$|In 1932, former sheriff Erv Kelley of McIntosh County, Oklahoma, {{was killed}} {{while trying to}} arrest Floyd on April 7. In November of that year, three members of Floyd's gang {{attempted}} to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Boley, Oklahoma. Despite his life of crime, Floyd was viewed positively by the general public. When he robbed banks he allegedly destroyed <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> but this has never been confirmed and may be myth. He was often protected by locals of Oklahoma, who referred to him as [...] "Robin Hood of the Cookson Hills".|$|R
50|$|Taylor {{took out}} a {{mortgage}} on the land in February 1866; according to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> the money was used to subdivide the land. Although money was taken for 26 of the 31 allotments auctioned in April that year, not all purchases were paid in full at that time. A deposit was paid on the allotment on which the cottage is located by James Jennings, whose name is recorded in the rate books for the property for 1868-69. Jennings however, {{does not appear to}} have ever paid the final balance due on the land.|$|R

50|$|It {{turns out}} that Qishan was {{previously}} holding a senior position at a finance company. At the age of 30, he became a high flyer in his field. Subsequently, Qishan sets up his own investment company. He identifies an investment product and manages to pull {{in a number of}} clients. However, short of $500,000, he discusses with his parents to mortgage their house to secure a loan for him. Both of them reject the idea. As Qishan is full of confidence in himself, he cons his father into signing the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> and invests the loan obtained.|$|R
5000|$|Supporters/members of RAFPT {{have stated}} that up to 2,000 people {{throughout}} Ireland have paid money at marketing events to 'sign up' to this 'trust' {{in order to prevent}} the repossession of properties. [...] Supporters of the trust claim that it exploits a loophole in <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> and other paperwork, that allows them to put assets beyond the reach of banks. The trust has yet to have a success in saving a property, and has been labelled as 'legal nonsense' in the High Court. The trust seems to hold certain qualities that could be identified as belonging to organisations better known as the Freeman on the land.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} the case that people choose to contact a title company or {{attorney}} to conduct an exhaustive title search. The process of performing a title search involves accessing the official land records for the subject property. Each record is a document evidencing an event which occurred {{in the history of the}} property. A deed records an event of property transfer, a <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> the collateral interest of a home loan, and a lien documents a claim against the property in favor of another, such as a creditor, vendor, or tradesman. The objective of the title search is to establish clear, marketable title by exposing any outstanding claims prior to transfer of title.|$|R
5000|$|Capital Coin also loaned dealer Delaware Valley Rare Coins in Broomall, Pennsylvania, {{which is}} not owned or {{controlled}} by Noe, $300,000 from the fund, which the dealer then used for his own business. The dealer used property in New Jersey as collateral. The Ohio newspaper The Toledo Blade made a public records request to the government to view the <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents.</b> Capital Coin had redacted the records, blacking out {{the address of the}} property and the owners. The Ohio attorney general ordered Noe to release the documents, noting [...] "anyone pledging property as collateral to back publicly funded investments must make their name and address public." [...] Lawyers for Capital Coin refused. The case was eventually settled.|$|R
30|$|Matching {{unfamiliar}} {{faces to}} photographic identification (ID) documents occurs across many domains, including financial transactions (e.g., <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents),</b> controlling {{the purchase of}} age-restricted goods (e.g., alcohol sales), and airport security. Laboratory research has repeatedly documented the fallibility of this process in novice observers, but little research has assessed individual differences based on occupational expertise (cf. White et al., PLoS One 9 :e 103510, 2014; White et al., Proceedings of the Royal Society B 282 (1814): 20151292, 2015). In the present study, over 800 professional notaries (who routinely verify identity prior to witnessing signatures on legal documents), 70 bank tellers, and 35 undergraduate students completed an online unfamiliar face-matching test. In this test, observers made match/nonmatch decisions to 30 face ID pairs (half of which were matches), with no time constraints and no trial-by-trial feedback.|$|R
40|$|Most {{mortgages}} on income-producing {{real estate}} (as distinct from owner-occupied housing) contain clauses restricting early payment of the loan. These clauses are highly controversial, and borrowers often resist their enforcement. While other writers have discussed prepayment clauses {{in the recent}} legal literature, my objectives {{in this article are}} to advance this discussion in three respects: first, to provide an economic perspective on mortgage prepayment as support for a set of legal recommendations; second, to consider whether the bankruptcy of the mortgagor should affect enforceability of a prepayment fee clause; and third, to analyze the cumulative effect of the presence in the same <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> of both a clause imposing a fee upon prepayment of the loan and a clause accelerating the loan in the event of default, sale, eminent domain taking, or hazard insurance payoff...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} contains 19 th business and legal documents of Leon and Johanna Levy. Of interest to researchers are the detailed tax and <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> {{as well as}} the extensive formal marriage contract. Leon Levy was born in 1807 (according to some documents in 1810) and worked as a merchant and possibly a money-lender in the Landau region, up to Frankfurt and east to Aschaffenburg. He married Hannchen Auerbach of Karlsruhe in 1831. They had two sons, Maximilian (1849 - 1925) and Carl (1843 - 1896), as well as three daughters - Julie (1847 - ?), Charlotte (Lottchen, 1845 - 1863) and Isabella (Bella, 1832 - 1857). Leon Levy died in 1855. His son Maximilian married Eugenie Schwabacher in 1878; they had three children: Richard, Erich and Elisabeth. Item-level inventory is in folder 1.

50|$|In {{mortgage}} securitization transactions, {{the mortgage}} servicer forwards the borrower's {{payment of principal}} and interest to the certificate holders (investors) of the special securitized trust that owns and holds the promissory notes secured by the mortgages and deeds of trust. The mortgage servicer, however, is allowed to retain late fees, BPO fees, inspection fees, and other fees charged or assessed to a borrower's account. In addition to the fee income, the servicer is allowed to retain the net liquidation proceeds of any foreclosure sale (net after foreclosure expenses and principal balance to investors). This provides an incentive to unscrupulous servicers who aggressively interpret <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents</b> to add additional fees to a borrower's mortgage account. Many times, the additional fees added on create an event of default allowing the mortgage servicer to foreclose on the property. This practice is {{commonly referred to as}} manufacturing a default or manufactured default.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the manager}} had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living {{back to the}} bank and asked him how much money they had. Living {{admitted}} to between £600 and £700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, £691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered [...] "No." [...] Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found £1650, making for a total of £2141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing <b>mortgage</b> <b>documents,</b> in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.|$|R
