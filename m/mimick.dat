25|$|Evreinov {{argued that}} the role of theatre was to ape and <b>mimick</b> nature. In his estimation, theatre is {{everything}} around us. He pointed out that nature is full of theatrical conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence.|$|E
25|$|One common {{feature of}} skyscrapers is a steel {{framework}} from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction. Most skyscrapers have a steel frame that {{enables them to}} be built taller than typical load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete. Skyscrapers usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls. Because the walls are not load-bearing most skyscrapers are characterized by surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain wall. However, skyscrapers can also have curtain walls that <b>mimick</b> conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.|$|E

Dismas, the good thief, hangs from a cross to the right of Jesus and an angel stands near his right shoulder ready to carry off his soul. The bad thief hangs on the cross to Jesus' left and in his case it is the devil who will carry off his soul. Both the angel and the devil clutch small doll like sculptures no doubt depictions of the souls they will eventually carry off.|$|E
25|$|Babbling {{is assumed}} to occur in all {{children}} acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear {{are the result of}} the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants <b>mimick</b> the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.|$|E

2500|$|One {{strategy}} is intracellular replication, as practised byMycobacterium tuberculosis, or wearing a protective capsule, which prevents lysis by complement and by phagocytes, as in Salmonella. Bacteroides species are normally mutualistic bacteria, {{making up a}} substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal flora.

They may also <b>mimick</b> host cells so the immune system does not recognize them as foreign. Staphylococcus aureus inhibits the ability of the phagocyte to respond to chemokine signals.

From late 2012 to early 2014, the two groups would alternate, with the Kami Band being used more for festival appearances and special events. At the Babymetal Death Match Tour in May 2013, the Kami Band performed all music live for the first time. As of early 2014, the Babybones band has been quietly retired, and the Kami Band has since been established as Babymetal's primary backing band.|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{has also}} been commented on by Chris Shepard from ANN noting a well crafted plot and good action scenes. However, he also criticized that during the first episodes the fights never get quite {{interesting}} as it becomes a bit predictable that Kenshin {{is going to win}} as the music of moments of victory is repeated many times. However, Mark A. Grey from the same site mentioned that all those negatives points disappear during the Kyoto Arc due to amazing fights and a great soundtrack. Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com had a similar opinion on the anime, and added that the characters' personalities' allowed the plot to develop into a good variety of interesting stories. She also liked the historical setting as it makes all the situations seem authentic. Lynzee Loveridge from Anime News Network highlighted as the most known series to use the Meiji period and saw the Kyoto Arc {{as one of the best}} ones. Although Them Anime's Carlos Ross also liked the action scenes and storyline, he added that the number of childish and violent scenes make the show a bit unbalanced, saying it is not recommended for younger children. Surat approved of the anime series, stating that while half of the first-season episodes consisted of filler, the situation [...] "clicks" [...] upon the introduction of Saitō Hajime and that he disagreed with people who disliked the television series compared to the OVAs. Surat said that while the Media Blasters anime dub is [...] "well-cast," [...] the English dub does not sound natural since the producers were too preoccupied with making the voice performances <b>mimick</b> the Japanese performances. Surat said that while he [...] "didn't mind" [...] the first filler arc with the Christianity sect, he could not stomach the final two filler arcs, and Japanese audiences disapproved of the final two filler arcs. Robin Brenner from Library Journal noted that despite its pacifist messages, Rurouni Kenshin was too violent, recommending it to older audiences.|$|E
