Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 and 1933, the {{scientists}} at the Cavendish Laboratory <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of ground-breaking discoveries. Cockroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium. This {{was one of the}} earliest experiments to change the atomic nucleus of one element to another by artificial means. Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.|$|E
5|$|In {{her second}} season {{of service in}} 1846, Great Britain {{successfully}} completed two round trips to New York at an acceptable speed, but was then laid up for repairs {{to one of her}} chain drums, which showed an unexpected degree of wear. Embarking on her third passage of the season to New York, her captain <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in Dundrum Bay on the northeast coast of Ireland. There was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John's light for the Calf light on the Isle of Man.|$|E
