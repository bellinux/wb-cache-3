60|$|One word more may {{be added}} on Mr. Gladstone as financier. He {{was far too}} {{comprehensive}} in his outlook to suppose that the great outburst of material prosperity during the years in which he controlled the exchequer and guided parliament in affairs of money, was wholly and without qualification due to budgets alone. To insist on ascribing complex results to single causes is the well-known vice of narrow and untrained minds. He was quite alive {{to the effects of}} “the enormous, constant, rapid, and diversified development of mechanical power, and the consequent saving of labour by the extension of machinery.” He was well aware of the share of new means of locomotion in the growth of industrial enterprise. But the special cause of what was most peculiar to England in the experience of this period he considered to be the wise legislation of parliament, in seeking every opportunity for abolishing restrictions upon the application of capital and the exercise of industry and skill. In this wise legislation his own energetic and beneficent genius played the <b>master</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Among {{the many}} acid {{pleasures of the}} work of Roberto Bolaño, who died at 50 in 2003, is his idea that culture, in {{particular}} literary culture, is a whore. In the face of political repression, upheaval and danger, writers continue to swoon over the written word, and this, for Bolaño, is the source both of nobility and of pitch-black humor. In his novel [...] "The Savage Detectives," [...] two avid young Latino poets never lose faith in their rarefied art no matter the vicissitudes of life, age and politics. If they are sometimes ridiculous, they are always heroic. But what can it mean, he asks us and himself, in his dark, extraordinary, stinging novella [...] "By Night in Chile," [...] that the intellectual elite can write poetry, paint and discuss the finer points of avant-garde theater as the junta tortures people in basements?

40|$|Abstract: A novel polymer microarrays {{fabrication}} {{technique is}} presented, {{and applied to}} the realization of {{a new type of}} biochip for cellulomics purposes. The proposed microfabrication technique is optimized for production cost reduction when small series (100 to 10000 chip series) are needed, which is the case when the actual market of cellulomic is considered. As a demonstration, a biochip for highly parallelized transfection of arrays of living cells was realized, and the feasibility of parallel lipofection on this biochip was demonstrated. Two different plasmids encoding respectively eGFP and DsRED 2 were inserted into HEK 293 T cells. The transfection was monitored through fluorescence observation after 72 hours. Successful expression of both genes was observed. The proposed microfabrication technique is derivated from a macroscale rapid prototyping technique called vacuum casting. The <b>master</b> <b>part</b> is here performed through combining microfabrication technologies and rapid prototyping technologies.

For some complex structures with distinct structural levels (presence of flexible parts attached to a stiff <b>master</b> <b>part),</b> numerous local elastic modes are intertwined with the usual global elastic modes, yielding high-dimension ROM. To circumvent this difficulty, a general method is proposed in order to construct a small-dimension ROM whose reduction vector basis is constituted of the global displacements only. The method is applied to an automobile complex structure...|$|E
40|$|A meter-scale {{model of}} the fibrous 1 CGD molecule, a {{synthetic}} collagen-like peptide, was modeled and manufactured for educational use. We chose to model and manufacture the 1 CGD molecule because collagen is of biological importance, the molecular coordinates are well-established, and because the molecular structure and geometry of 1 CGD are representative of many general concepts important {{to the study of}} proteins. The 1 CGD molecule consists of three polypeptide chains. Our model is three separately manufactured chains intertwined with one another after manufacture. The A chain of the 1 CGD molecule was first modeled using the SolidWorks computer aided drawing (CAD) software. The CAD model was then converted to a file that enabled us to manufacture a <b>master</b> <b>part</b> via a three-dimensional printing (3 DP) process available from Z Corporation. The 3 DP <b>master</b> <b>part</b> was used to manufacture a room temperature vulcanized (RTV) brush-on blanket mold and rigid plaster mother mold. The mold, created by artist Bob Shure at Skylight Studios, was then used to cast parts using a two component liquid plastic that cures to a solid material.

40|$|Object Robotic surgery can {{be applied}} as a novel technology. Our {{master-slave}} microscopic-micromanipulator system (NeuRobot), which has a rigid endoscope and three robot-arms, has been developed to perform neurosurgical procedures, and employed successfully in some clinical cases. Although the master and slave parts of NeuRobot are directly connected by wire, {{it is possible to}} separate each part and to apply it to telesurgery with some modifications. To evaluate feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgery, some basic experiments were performed. Methods The quality of telemedicine network system between Shinshu University and one of the affiliated hospitals, which was completely separated from other public network systems, was investigated. The communication delay was calculated from the transmitting and the receiving records in the computers set in each hospital. The relationship between the change in communication delay from the <b>master</b> <b>part</b> to the slave part of NeuRobot (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700 ms) respectively and feasibility of NeuRobot was investigated. The task performance time in each time changing group was compared. Feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgical usage was evaluated. The <b>master</b> <b>part</b> and the slave part of NeuRobot placed in each hospital were connected through private network system. Interhospitally connected NeuRobot was compared with directly connected one in terms of task performance time. Results Less than 1 ms was required for corresponding the data in a steady transmitting state. Within 2 seconds after connection, relative time delay (maximum 40 ms) and packet loss were sometimes observed. The mean task performance time was significantly longer in over 500 ms delayed group compared with directly connected NeuRobot. There {{was no significant difference in}} the task performance time between directly connected NeuRobot and interhospitally connected NeuRobot. Conclusion Our results proved that telesurgical usage of NeuRobot was feasible. Telesurgical usage of telecontrolled manipulator system is recommended for application in a private network system in order to reduce technical and ethical problems.

We ask users to drive the tip along complex trajectories in a virtual environment, using the real master to drive a simulated slave, and assess their performance. Results show that, concerning time, users with no training in laparoscopy prefer a direct mapping of position and orientation, like in free hand motion. However, users trained in laparoscopy perform equally fast with our hand-held robot and, concerning precision, make a smaller number of errors...|$|E

The amount of net slip of the <b>master</b> <b>part</b> of the Nagamachi-Rifu fault is estimated to be one mm/year. Seismic reflection profiles across the fault plus a gravity anomaly reveal the thicker Neogene sediments on the hanging wall rather than on the footwall. The Neogene sedimentary basin was formed by normal faulting in early Miocene under an extensional stress regime associated with the formation of the northern Honshu rift system. Due to shortening deformation since the Pliocene, this Miocene normal fault reactivated as a reverse fault.
