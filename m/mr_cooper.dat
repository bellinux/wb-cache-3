5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called <b>Mr</b> <b>Cooper</b> was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Bickley and Warren {{launched}} their own production plate, Bickley-Warren Productions, as associates to Miller/Boyett. The Bickley-Warren Productions entity oversaw Family Matters, Step by Step and Getting By for Miller/Boyett, and alone were later {{the producers of}} Hangin' With <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper</b> and Kirk, {{both of which were}} produced by Warner Bros. Television (which absorbed Lorimar Television in 1993). Despite the existence of the Bickley-Warren plate during the final two seasons of Perfect Strangers, and the fact that Bickley and Warren were still active as producers on Strangers, the Bickley-Warren logo was never added to the show's closing credits as an associate production company.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Thomas S. Murphy {{delegated}} {{his position}} as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO. Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million. Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including America's Funniest Home Videos (which {{has gone on to}} become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), Step by Step, Hangin' with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper,</b> Boy Meets World and Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters, as well as series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., Life Goes On, cult favorite Twin Peaks and The Commish. In September 1991, the network premiered Home Improvement, a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an accident-prone host of a cable-access home improvement show. Lasting eight seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including The Drew Carey Show; Brett Butler vehicle Grace Under Fire; and Ellen, which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.|$|E

25|$|Raven-Symoné {{appeared}} in several successful television series, such as The Cosby Show and Hangin' with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper,</b> {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. From 2003 to 2007, she starred in the Disney Channel series, That's So Raven in which she played Raven Baxter, a psychic teenager who tried her best to keep her psychic powers a secret. During her time on That's So Raven, Raven-Symoné released her third studio album, This is My Time (2004) which was her best selling solo album to date, charting at number 51 on the Billboard 200. A year {{after the end of}} That's So Raven, she released her fourth studio album, Raven-Symoné (2008). The album peaked at number 159 on the Billboard 200. During 2003 to 2006, she participated in four soundtracks from Disney, RIAA-certified double-platinum album, The Cheetah Girls (2003), RIAA-certified gold album, That's So Raven (2004), That's So Raven Too!

500|$|Gaven {{has done}} much voice acting in her career, lending {{her voice to}} {{television}} and radio advertisements and playing animated characters in The Pink Panther (1993), Red Planet (1994), and Small Soldiers (1998). Working with advertisements earned Gaven more money than playing theatre. [...] "I can make in an hour what I make in a week doing theater," [...] she said in 1997. Gaven has also made guest star appearances in live-action television series such as The George Carlin Show (1994), Ellen (1995), Get Smart (1995), The Drew Carey Show (1996), Hangin' with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper</b> (1997), Frasier (1998), and Beverly Hills, 90210 (1998).

2500|$|According to {{that same}} letter to Dodderidge, two {{publishers}} rejected the poem before it was finally first published in 1743, in London by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper.</b> [...] The grounds for rejection, as related by Blair, were that he lived {{too far away from}} London to be able to [...] "write so as to be acceptable to the fashionable and polite". [...] He sarcastically observed that [...] "to what distance from the metropolis these sapient booksellers conceived poetical inspiration to extend, we are not informed".|$|E
6000|$|Miss Gunnill sighed. [...] "I wish {{he lived}} in Little-stow," [...] she said, slowly. [...] "I’d give {{anything}} to take that horrid <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Cooper</b> down a bit. Cooper would be the laughing-stock of the town." ...|$|R

2500|$|Film critic Vincent Canby lauded {{the acting}} and the {{cinematography}} {{in the film}} and wrote in his review, [...] "There's not a weak performance in the film, but I especially admired the work of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper,</b> Mr. Tighe, Miss McDonnell, Miss Mette, Mr. Gunton, Mr. Strathairn and Mr. Mostel. They may be playing Social-Realist icons, but each manages to make something personal and idiosyncratic out of the material, without destroying the ballad-like style. [...] For the most part, Haskell Wexler's photography doesn't go overboard in finding poetry in the images." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, TNN added off-network sitcoms and dramas such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Wonder Years, The Rockford Files, WKRP in Cincinnati, Newhart, Hangin' With <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper,</b> Miami Vice and Taxi. It {{also became}} the first channel to air reruns of MADtv. These moves went unnoticed for the most part, due to TNN's lack of popularity. By this time, all country-western {{programming}} had been purged from the network; some of The Nashville Network's former programming {{was picked up by}} CMT, while other classic TNN shows were picked up by GAC, including eventually the Grand Ole Opry, which was pushed off to CMT and eventually removed by Viacom after they did not renew the agreement to carry the series in an attempt to infuse a more youthful schedule on CMT.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{fact that}} had been altered in the film was the {{statement}} by Trudy Cooper, who commented that she [...] "wondered how they would've felt if every time their husband went in to make a deal, there was a one-in-four chance he wouldn't {{come out of that}} meeting". According to the book, this actually reflected the 23% chance of dying during a 20-year career as a normal pilot. For a test pilot, these odds were higher, at 53%, but were still considerably less than the movie implied. In addition, the movie merely used the fictional <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Cooper</b> as a vehicle for the statement; the real <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Cooper</b> is not known to have said this.|$|R
50|$|Cooper had {{to resign}} {{and return to}} England in 1889, in {{consequence}} of his wife’s illness. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Cooper</b> died in 1891. Soon after Anna’s death he must have met and married his second wife, but date, place and her name is unknown.|$|R

60|$|Poor <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cooper</b> {{did not get}} on {{very well}} with Mrs. Morton. All his remembrances of the old squire were eulogistic and affectionate. Hers were just the reverse.
