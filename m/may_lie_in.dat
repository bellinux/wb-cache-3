T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> the Menk.|$|E

25|$|A {{division}} between Force and consciousness in evolution: matter, life and mind are often warring with each other.

25|$|Trudeau's most {{enduring}} legacy <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> {{his contribution to}} Canadian nationalism, and of pride in Canada in and for itself {{rather than as a}} derivative of the British Commonwealth.

25|$|In general, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that smaller colonies are less aggressive than larger ones. There are differing observations of the D. arenaria’s personality, one stating that they are quarrelsome and then other arguing that they are not. But this difference <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> the fact that the first observation was observing the behavior when approaching a D. arenaria nest, whereas the other was describing behavior of workers away from their nest individually. Smaller colonies’ colony defense behavior is said to be unpredictable and erratic.|$|E

25|$|Olympus Mons is {{asymmetrical}} structurally {{as well as}} topographically. The longer, more shallow northwestern flank displays extensional features, such {{as large}} slumps and normal faults. In contrast, the volcano's steeper southeastern side has features indicating compression. They include step-like terraces in the volcano's mid-flank region (interpreted as thrust faults) {{and a number of}} wrinkle ridges located at the basal escarpment. Why opposite sides of the mountain should show different styles of deformation is puzzling. The answer <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> understanding how large shield volcanoes grow laterally and on how variations within the substrate of the volcano affect the final shape of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} into the arena and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v. Public Prosecutor (1989). When a judge is found to have prejudged, he will not have an open mind and is likely to have determined issues adversely against a party before the presentation of a case. However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few {{historical}} details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> {{the fact that the}} Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between Haggai and Zechariah, slightly before Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445BC.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} in female graduates in agricultural sciences {{since the turn of}} the century. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily, with eight countries reporting a share of women graduates of 40% or more: Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this surge are unclear, although one explanation <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> the growing emphasis on national food security and the food industry. Another possible explanation is that women are highly represented in biotechnology. For example, in South Africa, women were underrepresented in engineering (16%) in 2004 and in ‘natural scientific professions’ (16%) in 2006 but made up 52% of employees working in biotechnology-related companies.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{imagined}} as a Celtic hero, who vanquished Viking foes and {{fostered a}} Gaelic renaissance, contemporary sources instead reveal that Somerled operated in, and belonged to, the same Norse-Gaelic cultural environment as his maritime neighbours. By his wife, Ragnhild, daughter of Olafr Godredsson, King of the Isles, {{a member of}} the Crovan dynasty, Somerled and his descendants claimed the Kingdom of the Isles. A later medieval successor to this kingdom, the Lordship of the Isles, was ruled by Somerled's descendants until the late 15th century. Regarded as a significant figure in 12th-century Scottish and Manx history, Somerled is proudly proclaimed as a patrilineal ancestor by several Scottish clans. Recent genetic studies suggest that Somerled has hundreds of thousands of patrilineal descendants, and that his patrilineal origins <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> Scandinavia.|$|E

25|$|Arnold {{began in}} showbusiness as an actor, working {{for six or}} seven years for the BBC. During this time he {{realised}} his talents <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> working behind the camera, so joined the BBC as a runner, and spent 11 years working his way up to becoming a director. His first episode of EastEnders was on 23 November 2000 and he has since directed several notable episodes including Dot Branning's (June Brown) single-hander episode, the Christmas Day 2008 episodes, a live episode on 19 February 2010 celebrating the show's 25th anniversary, which won the award for Best Single Episode at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and the 4466th episode, in which Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carries the Olympic Flame in a live segment of the episode, which was nominated for Spectacular Scene of the Year at the 2013 British Soap Awards. He has also directed for ITV's Emmerdale and Where the Heart Is, BBC's Holby City, and a special EastEnders spin-off, Perfectly Frank, focusing on the character Frank Butcher (Mike Reid).|$|E
25|$|Maximising funding {{permitted}} under pre-emption rules. For countries, {{such as the}} UK, where {{companies are}} subject to limits {{on the number of}} shares that can be offered to non-shareholders non-pre-emptively, convertibles can raise more money than via equity issues. Under the UK’s 1989 Guidelines issued by the Investor Protection Committees (IPCs) of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers (NAPF), the IPCs will advise their members not to object to non pre-emptive issues which add no more than 5pct to historic non-diluted balance sheet equity in the period from AGM to AGM, and no more than 7.5pct in total over a period of 3 financial years. The pre-emption limits are calculated on the assumption of 100pct probability of conversion, using the figure of undiluted historic balance sheet share capital (where there is assumed a 0pct probability of conversion). There is no attempt to assign probabilities of conversion in both circumstances, which would result in bigger convertible issues being permitted. The reason for his inconsistency <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> the fact that the Pre Emption Guidelines were drawn up in 1989, and binomial evaluations were not commonplace amongst professional investors until 1991-92.|$|E

500|$|Diminished {{cognitive}} flexibility {{has been}} noted {{in a variety of}} neuropsychiatric disorders such as anorexia nervosa, obsessive–compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and in a subset of people with ADHD. Each of these disorders exhibit varying aspects of cognitive inflexibility. [...] For example, those with obsessive–compulsive disorder experience difficulty shifting their attentional focus as well as inhibiting motor responses. Children with autism show a slightly different profile with deficits in adjusting to changing task contingencies, while often maintaining the ability to respond in the face of competing responses. Potential treatments <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> neurochemical modulation. [...] Juveniles with Anorexia nervosa have marked decreases in set-shifting abilities, possibly associated with incomplete maturation of prefrontal cortices associated with malnutrition. One can also consider people with addictions to be limited in cognitive flexibility, in that they are unable to flexibly respond to stimuli previously associated with the drug.|$|E
