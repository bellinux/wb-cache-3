There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes.

5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning.

In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic <b>manufacturers</b> <b>are</b> at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments.

Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
