As a result of a decision of the Korean Workers' Party in October 1966, in early 1967 the DPRK sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi. They stayed through 1968; 200 pilots were reported to have served. In addition, at least two anti-aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Appropriations {{of the military}} services provide resources {{for a wide variety}} of programs, including <b>manpower</b> <b>support</b> programs. It is assumed that some relationship exists between changes in manpower levels and O&M tunding, often referred to as the O&M support "tail"This research examined the O&M, Navy and O&M, Marine Corps appropriations to identify programs which provide funding that surports the general active duty population of the Navy and Marine Corps. A framework to be used in calculating the O&M support "tail" that accompanies manpower adjustments was developed. It was determined that the O&M support "tail" was small and specific to certain <b>manpower</b> <b>support</b> programs. Many O&M <b>manpower</b> <b>support</b> costs will not change until force structure and infrastructure changes take place. It is concluded that O&M adjustments based on changes to manpower should be targeted only at specific programs whose costs vary with the manpower level. Otherwise, O&M reductions are essentially horizontal adjustments which have the potential to either under or overfund other O&M programs. U. S. Naval Reserve (USNR) autho...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} develop a high-energy heavy-ion {{experimental}} database and make it accessible to the scientific community through an on-line interface. The database will be searchable and cross-indexed with relevant publications, including published detector descriptions. It should eventually contain all published data from older heavy-ion {{programs such as the}} Bevalac, AGS, SPS and FNAL fixed-target programs, as well as published data from current programs at RHIC and new facilities at GSI (FAIR), KEK/Tsukuba and the LHC collider. This data includes all proton-proton, proton-nucleus to nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as other relevant systems and all measured observables. Such a database would have tremendous scientific payoff as it makes systematic studies easier and allows simpler benchmarking of theoretical models to a broad range of experiments. To enhance the utility of the database, we propose periodic data evaluations and topical reviews. These reviews would provide an alternative and impartial mechanism to resolve discrepancies between published data from rival experiments and between theory and experiment. Since this database will be a community resource, it requires the high-energy nuclear physics community's financial and <b>manpower</b> <b>support...</b>|$|E

40|$|Manpower {{planning}} {{in the field}} of health care on a national level is a regular item on the agenda of policy makers. Recent examples are the quantities of dentists and ophtalmologists in the Netherlands. This paper decribes a methodology for manpower {{planning in}} health care, applied {{in the field of}} rheumatology. In health care, important decisions usually have a multi-level and multi-actor character: different actors with different mental models, goals and power interact in a bargaining process, dealing with various problem situations on the regional as well as the national level. A group decision making approach is advocated, where interactive model building stimulates shared meaning and communication. The Group Decision Support System methodology to <b>support</b> <b>manpower</b> decision processes is described in this paper, and some early results are given in the form of conceptual models and a simulation model.
