40|$|<b>Mutant</b> p 53 gain of {{function}} contributes to cancer progression, increased invasion and metastasis potentials, {{and resistance to}} anticancer therapy. The ability of <b>mutant</b> p 53 to acquire its gain {{of function}} is shown to correlate with increased expression of progrowth genes, such as c-MYC, MDR 1, and NF-κB 2. However, most of the published studies to identify <b>mutant</b> p 53 target genes were performed in a cell system that artificially overexpresses <b>mutant</b> p 53. Thus, it remains unclear whether such <b>mutant</b> p 53 targets can be regulated by endogenous physiological levels of <b>mutant</b> p 53. Here, we utilized SW 480 and MIA-PaCa- 2 cells, in which endogenous <b>mutant</b> p 53 can be inducibly knocked down, to identify <b>mutant</b> p 53 target genes that potentially mediate <b>mutant</b> p 53 gain of function. We found that knockdown of <b>mutant</b> p 53 inhibits GRO 1 expression, whereas ectopic expression of <b>mutant</b> R 175 H in p 53 -null HCT 116 cells increases GRO 1 expression. In addition, we found that endogenous <b>mutant</b> p 53 is capable of binding to and activating the GRO 1 promoter. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GRO 1 can rescue the proliferative defect in SW 480 and MIA-PaCa- 2 cells induced by knockdown of <b>mutant</b> p 53. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous GRO 1 inhibits cell proliferation and thus abrogates <b>mutant</b> p 53 gain of function in SW 480 cells. Taken together, our findings define a novel mechanism by which <b>mutant</b> p 53 acquires its gain of function via transactivating the GRO 1 gene in cancer cells. Thus, targeting GRO 1 for cancer therapy would be applicable to {{a large portion of}} human tumors with <b>mutant</b> p 53, but the exploration of GRO 1 as a potential target should take the mutation status of p 53 into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} shows that <b>mutant</b> p 53 proteins, which are present in many human tumors, gain oncogenic activities that can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. <b>Mutant</b> p 53 proteins have been extensively shown to affect the expression of several genes involved in various aspects of cancer biology. We show here the ChIP-on-chip analysis of <b>mutant</b> p 53 binding {{to a set of}} 154 promoters, composed of both validated and putative <b>mutant</b> p 53 target genes. By using the chromatin obtained from <b>mutant</b> p 53 R 175 H-immunoprecipitation in proliferating SKBr 3 breast cancer cells, we found that <b>mutant</b> p 53 binds to 40 of the 154 promoters analyzed. siRNA-mediated <b>mutant</b> p 53 knock-down modulates the transcript abundance of some of these target genes. Two-thirds of the <b>mutant</b> p 53 -bound promoters were also engaged by either p 300 or PCAF acetyl-transferases, strongly indicating the presence of transcriptionally active complexes. We also found that NF-kB binding sites are overrepresented among the <b>mutant</b> p 53 -bound promoters; a ChIP-on-chip analysis confirmed that NF-kB p 65 binds to 27 of the <b>mutant</b> p 53 -bound promoters, indicating that <b>mutant</b> p 53 could influence the transcriptional output of these NF-kB target genes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to develop a new auxotropic <b>mutant</b> from a regulatory <b>mutant</b> and to examine its potency for L-lysine production. A high L-lysine yielding strain Micrococcus glutamicus AB 200 was developed from a regulatory <b>mutant</b> Micrococcus glutamicus AB 5 by subsequent mutagenic treatment with UV rays and methyl methane sulfonate respectively. Treatment of UV rays on the regulatory <b>mutant</b> AB 5 resulted in a <b>mutant</b> strain AB 50 gives the maximum yield of L-lysine (5. 5 mg/mL) than the regulatory <b>mutant</b> (0. 9 mg/mL).

40|$|Mutations in calreticulin (CALR) are {{phenotypic}} {{drivers in}} {{the pathogenesis of}} myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Mechanistic {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>mutant</b> CALR binds to the thrombopoietin receptor MPL, and that the positive electrostatic charge of the <b>mutant</b> CALR C-terminus is required for <b>mutant</b> CALR-mediated activation of JAK-STAT signaling. Here we demonstrate that although binding between <b>mutant</b> CALR and MPL is required for <b>mutant</b> CALR to transform hematopoietic cells, binding alone is insufficient for cytokine independent growth. We further show that the threshold of positive charge in the <b>mutant</b> CALR C-terminus influences both binding of <b>mutant</b> CALR to MPL and activation of MPL signaling. We find that <b>mutant</b> CALR binds to the extra-cellular domain of MPL and that three tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of MPL are required to activate signaling. With respect to <b>mutant</b> CALR function, we show that its lectin-dependent function is required for binding to MPL and for cytokine independent growth while its chaperone and polypeptide binding functionalities are dispensable.
