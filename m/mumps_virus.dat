25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the mumps vaccine, the <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than two per 100,000). In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of mumps meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97 percent), vomiting (94 percent) and headache (88.8 percent). The mumps vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction there has been a steady decrease in the incidence of mumps and <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> infection. There were 151,209 cases of mumps reported in 1968. From 2001 to 2008, the case average was only 265 per year, excluding an outbreak of less than 6000 cases in 2006 attributed largely to university contagion in young adults.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{deficiency}} is {{a relatively}} rare cause of erectile dysfunction. In individuals with testicular failure like in Klinefelter syndrome, or those who have had radiation therapy, chemotherapy or childhood exposure to <b>mumps</b> <b>virus,</b> the testes may fail and not produce testosterone. Other hormonal causes of erectile failure include brain tumors, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism or disorders of the adrenal gland.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the {{preceding}} paper (1) that inapparent, persistent infection of MCN or Lung-To cultures with Newcastle disease (NDV), 6 - 6, or <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> is readily detected by resistance of the cells to certain cytopathogenic viruses, especially the virus of vesicular stomatitis (VSV). Efforts were made to determine the nature of this resistance. These experiments were largely restricted to study of MCN cultures infected with NDV (referred to as MCNN, v) and only few tests involved also cultures infected with 6 - 6 or <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> (MCNe. e or MCNMp,). The results are compatible with the suggestion that the resistance induced by persistent infection of the cultures represents an example of viral interference. Methods and Materials All methods and materials employed for preparation and maintenance of the tissue cultures as well as for production of stock viruses and viral assays have been described in detail in the preceding paper (I). For inactivation of NDV by ultraviolet irradiation the following technic was used. Infected ailantoic fluids were dialyzed in cellophane casing against 20 volume...|$|R

25|$|The order Mononegavirales is the taxonomic home of {{numerous}} related viruses. Members {{of the order}} that are commonly known are, for instance, Ebola virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, <b>mumps</b> <b>virus,</b> Nipah virus, and rabies virus. All of these viruses cause significant disease in humans. Many very important pathogens of nonhuman animals and plants are also members of this order.|$|E
25|$|Mumps is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} <b>mumps</b> <b>virus.</b> Initial signs and {{symptoms}} often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility.|$|E
25|$|Mumps {{is spread}} {{from person to}} person through contact with {{respiratory}} secretions, such as saliva from an infected person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Mumps can also be spread by sharing eating utensils or cups. The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner. A person infected with mumps is contagious from approximately seven days before the onset of symptoms until about eight days after symptoms start. The incubation period (time until symptoms begin) can be from 12–25 days, but is typically 16–18 days. 20-40 percent of persons infected with the <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> do not show symptoms, so it is possible to be infected and spread the virus without knowing it.|$|E
5000|$|It has {{now also}} been shown that use of the MMR vaccine (which is taken to include live {{attenuated}} measles vaccine <b>virus,</b> measles <b>virus,</b> <b>mumps</b> vaccine <b>virus</b> and rubella vaccine virus, and wild strains of the aforementioned viruses) results in ileal lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, chronic colitis and pervasive developmental disorder including autism (RBD), in some infants.|$|R
40|$|Immunizing infants against measles at the {{youngest}} age possible {{has the potential}} to reduce morbidity and mortality. The ability of infants at 6, 9, or 12 months to respond to measles and mumps vaccines was evaluated by measuring T cell proliferation, interferon-gproduction, and neutralizing antibody titers before and after vaccination. Infants in all age groups had equivalent cellular immune responses to measles or <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses,</b> with or without passive antibodies when immunized. In contrast, 6 -month-old infants without passive antibodies had low geometric mean titers of antibody to measles or <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> and low seroconversion rates. Geometric mean titers of antibody to measles virus increased if infants were revaccinated at 12 months. Six-month-old infants had limited humoral responses to paramyxovirus vac-cines, whereas cellular immunity was equivalent to that of older infants. T cell responses can be established by immunization with these live attenuated virus vaccines during the first year, despite the presence of passive antibodies.

40|$|Parts of the F gene from 16 <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> {{derived from}} {{vaccines}} and clinical isolates were amplified using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} and their nucleotide sequences were determined.

2500|$|Painful {{testicular}} inflammation {{develops in}} 15–40 {{percent of men}} who have completed puberty and contract the <b>mumps</b> <b>virus.</b> This testicular inflammation is generally one-sided (both testicles are swollen in 15–30 percent of mumps orchitis cases) and typically occurs about 10 days after the parotid gland inflamed. Testicular swelling has been documented as late as six weeks after parotid gland swelling.

40|$|An {{interaction}} between fibronectin and viral envelope glycoprotein micelles isolated from influenza A, parainfluenza 1, and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> {{was found by}} enzyme immunoassay. All three different glycoprotein micelles bound efficiently to solid-phase fibronectin. When fibronectin was permitted to bind to solid-phase viral glycoproteins, dose-dependent binding was observed. Soluble glycoprotein micelles inhibited the binding of fibronectin to immobilized glycoprotein preparations. The binding was not observed when fibronectin was pretreated with neuraminidase, suggesting that the sugar moieties of fibronectin {{are responsible for the}} affinity.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to develop a test {{requiring}} no preadsorption steps for the assessment of antibodies to rubella and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> using the passive immune agglutination (PIA) method. Both rubella and mumps antigens and antibodies were prepared. Direct PIA tests, using rubella antigen-coated beads, and indirect PIA tests, using rubella antibody-coated beads, were investigated. Attempts, using either method, were unsuccessful. Serum interference along with nonspecific agglutination of beads by the rubella antigen resulted in no specific response under the test conditions investigated. A new, highly sensitive approach, the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test system, is recommended to overcome the nonspecificity. This system is a logical outgrowth of some of the solid phase work done on MEMS and represents the next generation tests system that can be directly applied to early disease detection and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{infection}} {{has been}} suggested to play a triggering role in the pancreatic beta cell destruction which occurs in insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In this study a human insulinoma cell line has been infected with measles, <b>mumps</b> and rubella <b>viruses</b> since a temporal association is reported between the clinical onset of IDDM and diseases caused by these viruses. The infection with measles and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> induced the release of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) by the cell line as assessed by a bioassay and up-regulated the expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens as evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis. Stimulation with rubella virus induced the release of IL- 6 only and {{had no effect on}} HLA antigen expression. These data show {{for the first time that}} IL- 1 and IL- 6 secretion by an insulinoma cell line may occur after viral infection and suggest that cytokine release and increased expression of HLA molecules by beta cells may act to induce the immune response towards beta cells in IDDM...|$|R

40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera from 129 {{patients}} {{of a study}} population of 139 were tested for antibody to herpes simplex, measles,and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses.</b> Herpes simplex virus antibody was found in three of five patients with laboratory-confirmed herpes simplex infection and in eight patients without serological or virological evidence of current infection with this or other common neurotropic visuses. Eleven of the 139 patients were studied for antibody to lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Eight of these had laboratory-confirmed LCM infection, and antibody was detected in the CSF of five of them. In one of these five, complement-fixing antibody appeared earlier in the CSF than in the blood. Assay of LCM virus antibody in the CSF may thus indicate infection with LCM virus more rapidly than serological and virological studies.

40|$|Introduction. Coxsackie and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{nowadays}} {{known to}} be pancreatropic viruses. However, the development of insulitis after viral infection {{is related to the}} genetic factor. Type I diabetes shows an association with the HLA antigens. HLA antigens are involved in cellular immune response and in the regulation of T-cell activation. Case report. A female patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to the Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders. The onset of diabetes was preceded by recurrent viral infections. Her blood glucose levels oscillated, and HbA 1 c was 7. 9 %. The presence of IgM antibodies to Coxsackie virus was detected (titer 320 m/ml). Conclusion. Each viral infection, especially in young people, should be taken seriously, and bed rest should be advised with symptomatic therapy.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of Newcastle disease, influenza A and B, and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> by a labile component present in normal serum {{has been described}} previously (1). In addition to complement another component of normal serum, distinct from complement, was required for viral inhibition. Inactivation of virus by this inhibitor was temperature-dependent, appeared to require calcium, and under usual circumstances the virus did not dissociate spontaneously from the inhibitor. These findings were in agreement {{with those of other}} investigators (2 [...] 4) and characterized the heat-labile inhibitor of normal serum as a mechanism distinct from antibody (1 [...] 4) or heat-stable (Francis) inhibitors of viral hemagglutination (2 [...] 4).

40|$|A new {{personal}} bioaerosol sampler {{has recently}} been developed and evaluated for sampling of viable airborne bacteria and fungi under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field. The operational principle of the device {{is based on the}} passage of air through porous medium immersed in liquid. This process leads to the formation of bubbles within the filter as the carrier gas passes through and thus provides effective mechanisms for aerosol removal. As demonstrated in previous studies, the culturability of sampled bacterium and fungi remained high for the entire 8 -h sampling period. The present study is the first step of the evaluation of the new sampler for monitoring of viable airborne viruses. It focuses on the investigation of the inactivation rate of viruses in the bubbling process during 4 h of continuous operation. Four microbes were used in this study, influenza, measles, <b>mumps,</b> and vaccinia <b>viruses.</b> It was found that the use of distilled water as the collection fluid was associated with a relatively high decay rate. A significant improvement was achieved by utilizing virus maintenance fluid prepared by using Hank’s solution with appropriate additives. The survival rates of the influenza, measles, and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> were increased by 1. 4 log, 0. 83 log, and 0. 82 log, respectively, after the first hour of operation compared to bubbling through the sterile water.

In the ultracentrifuge the purified preparation behaves as a polydisperse macromolecular substance. The active material can be obtained from red cell stroma in an ether- and chloroform-soluble form which, on further treatment, can be converted into chloroform-insoluble material.

40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV), {{a member}} of the Morbillivirus genus that also includes measles virus, frequently causes neurologic complications, but the routes and timing of CDV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. To characterize these events, we cloned and sequenced the genome of a neurovirulent CDV (strain A 75 / 17) and produced an infectious cDNA that expresses the green fluorescent protein. This virus fully retained its virulence in ferrets: the course and signs of disease were equivalent to those of the parental isolate. We observed CNS invasion through two distinct pathways: anterogradely via the olfactory nerve and hematogenously through the choroid plexus and cerebral blood vessels. CNS invasion only occurred after massive infection of the lymphatic system and spread to the epithelial cells throughout the body. While at early time points, mostly immune and endothelial cells were infected, the virus later spread to glial cells and neurons. Together, the results suggest similarities in the timing, target cells, and CNS invasion routes of CDV, members of the Morbillivirus genus, and even other neurovirulent paramyxoviruses like Nipah and <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{agglutination}} of {{red blood}} cells by certain viruses is the function of a specific receptor substance associated with the cells, which combines with the virus (1). This reaction has provided in vitro methods for detecting these viruses and also their antibodies, since the latter specifically inhibit the agglutination reaction. It has been observed, however, that non-specific inhibition of virus hemagglutination {{may be caused by}} a variety of materials including normal sera (2), extracts of animal tissues (3), normal allantoic fluid (4, 5), and human tears (6). Of interest in this respect is the finding that hemagglutination with PVM virus in mouse lung extracts is not manifest unless the extracts are heated to 70 °C.

Immunological examination of these children conducted within 4 months after finishing of therapy revealed absence of immunodeficiency. It gave opportunities to vaccinate or revaccinate these children against mentioned infections. Fifty three children were immunized against measles and 47 — against mumps. Application of live vaccines was safe because majority of vaccinated against measles (81, 1 %) and mumps (82, 9 %) children had mild vaccination process.
