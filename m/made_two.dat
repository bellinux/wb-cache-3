5|$|Alimuddin played 25 Test matches for Pakistan {{during his}} career and scored 1,091 runs in {{international}} cricket at the average of 25.37. He <b>made</b> <b>two</b> centuries and seven fifties. Cricket critics believed that he possessed a sound technique. In Test matches, Alimuddin established an effective opening partnership with Hanif Mohammad.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, a hendecagrammic prism {{is a star}} {{polyhedron}} <b>made</b> from <b>two</b> identical regular hendecagrams {{connected by}} squares. The related hendecagrammic antiprisms are <b>made</b> from <b>two</b> identical regular hendecagrams connected by equilateral triangles.|$|R
50|$|These {{isosceles}} triangles {{can be used}} {{to produce}} Penrose tilings. Penrose tiles are made from kites and darts. A kite is <b>made</b> from <b>two</b> golden triangles, and a dart is <b>made</b> from <b>two</b> gnomons.|$|R
25|$|Each baryon has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antibaryon) where quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is <b>made</b> of <b>two</b> up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is <b>made</b> of <b>two</b> up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|R
5|$|In June 2005, {{former manager}} Gérard Houllier, then with French club Lyon, made an {{approach}} to sign Baroš. The player rejected the approach, but only <b>made</b> <b>two</b> substitute appearances for Liverpool in the 2005–06 season before leaving the club. He left Liverpool with league figures of 19 goals in 68 appearances.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} session, Maguire {{took the first}} frame, but Higgins won the next three, compiling a 100 break in the third. Breaks of 72, 55, and 76 allowed Maguire to regain the lead, before Higgins took the eighth after Maguire missed a straightforward red to leave it 4–4 {{at the end of}} the first session. In the evening session, Higgins took the ninth, before Maguire <b>made</b> <b>two</b> breaks over 50 in the 10th. Higgins then <b>made</b> <b>two</b> consecutive century breaks, including a 144 in the 11th, which equalled his own highest break. He continued his run with a break of 68 in the 13th, before Maguire pulled one back in the next. A 97 break gave Higgins the victory.|$|E
5|$|Konnan <b>made</b> <b>two</b> final {{appearances}} for World Wrestling All-Stars in May 2003, {{before the}} promotion folded. He also wrestled a tag match teamed with Norman Smiley for MXPW in September 2003. These {{would be his}} last extended stints in the independent circuit for nearly a decade.|$|E
50|$|Each type of baryon has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antibaryon) in which quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks. For example, just as a proton is <b>made</b> of <b>two</b> up-quarks and one down-quark, its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is <b>made</b> of <b>two</b> up-antiquarks and one down-antiquark.|$|R
50|$|Emperor / Emperor X / Vintage Emperor - Drumheads <b>made</b> with <b>two</b> {{free-floating}} plies (7 mil) of Mylar film, {{making them}} the brightest-sounding two-ply heads {{and the most}} durable clear heads of the Weatherking series. Emperor X heads are <b>made</b> with <b>two</b> 10 mil plies of Mylar with a 5 mil reverse dot, making these Remo's most durable drumheads among rock and metal drummers. Vintage Emperor heads are <b>made</b> with <b>two</b> plies (7.5 mil) of polyester film. Emperor X heads come in snare sizes only, while Vintage Emperors are also available as clear heads.|$|R

5|$|A {{delegation}} from Leeds, {{including two}} Members of Parliament (MPs), {{met with the}} Home Secretary, H H Asquith on 27 January to press the borough's case. Along with {{the claims of the}} borough as set out in the original petition, the delegation <b>made</b> <b>two</b> more points: Leeds was the only university town not a city, and Leeds and Sheffield were the only boroughs returning five MPs to the House of Commons without the status (of a city).|$|E

5|$|A man {{was sent}} to New York to receive payment for the stock, but Grey had {{forgotten}} that he had ever stopped at Martha's Vineyard. Colonel Beriah Norton <b>made</b> <b>two</b> special trips to London for the same purpose, and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament. Very little was accomplished in these two trips to England.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf {{frequently}} sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, {{as well as}} some in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, Pan Gulf <b>made</b> <b>two</b> roundtrips {{from the}} U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They <b>made</b> <b>two</b> deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the front office were expected during the offseason.|$|E

5|$|Australia <b>made</b> <b>two</b> {{changes for}} the Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Doug Ring. Tallon <b>made</b> <b>two</b> as Australia declared at 8/489. He conceded seven byes and did not make a dismissal as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Between the 2004 and 2005 seasons, Adams played indoor {{football}} {{with the}} Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League and the Peoria Rough Riders of af2. On May 9, 2005, Adams left the Peoria Rough Riders to attend training camp with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He {{acted as a}} backup for the Roughriders throughout the 2005 season. In July, he started in place of Nate Davis, who was unable to play due to back spasms. Adams went on to play in only five regular season games, where he <b>made</b> <b>two</b> sacks and four tackles.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played {{in the final two}} Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth <b>made</b> <b>two</b> centuries in the 196263 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He <b>made</b> <b>two</b> further centuries the following summer against South Africa and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of Richie Benaud, Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 196566 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and chickenpox respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. He was inducted into the Cricket NSW Hall of Fame in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Brenda <b>made</b> <b>two</b> landfalls in Mexico: {{first in}} the Yucatan and later in Campeche. Little damage {{resulted}} from the storm throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. However, severe damage took place in areas near Brenda's second landfall. A total of 10 people {{were killed by the}} hurricane and over 2,000 more were left homeless. Flooding caused by Brenda was considered to be the worst in over 25 years in some places.|$|E
