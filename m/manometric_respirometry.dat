40|$|For {{predicting}} the environmental {{fate of a}} chemical a knowledge of its biodegradability is essential. Several kinds of tests, standardized by the OECD and EEC for the determination of ultimate biodegradability (mineralization), are available. The degradation is determined by nonspecific analyses such as the measurement of DOC (e. g. modified OECD screening test), microbial oxygen uptake (modified MITI test; <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test) or the microbial release of COsub 2 (modified Sturm test). For testing the biodegradability of two stroke engine oils a special test {{was developed by the}} CEC (Co-Ordination European Council) : the CEC L- 33 -T- 82. In this test the criterion for biodegradability is the elimination of the characteristic CHsub 3 CHsub 2 - groups as determined by IR-spectroscopy. Comparative studies with three synthetic lubricant base stocks revealed that significant differences may occur for this substance class. The degradation of the three substances was 100 percent in the CEC-te st, whereas in the <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test degradation levels below 40 percent were obtained; in the modified Sturm test the degradation was between 44 and 85 percent. In the <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test no substance fulfilled the criterion of ready biodegradability, whereas all three substances reached the pass level in the CEC- test. Results obtained in the CEC-test and in mineralization tests should be in good agreement when no significant formation of microbial biomass and no formation of hydrophilic metabolites takes place. Both parameter contribute to a high percentage of biodegradation in the CEC-test, but low apparent biodegradability in tests for ultimate biodegradability...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradation tests {{according}} to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standard 301 F (<b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test) with technical iminodisuccinate (IDS) revealed ready biodegradability for all stereoisomers of IDS. The IDS-degrading strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens BY 6 was isolated from activated sludge. The strain {{was able to}} grow on each IDS isomer {{as well as on}} Fe 2 +-, Mg 2 +-, and Ca 2 +-IDS complexes as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In contrast, biodegradation of and growth on Mn 2 +-IDS were rather scant and very slow on Cu 2 +-IDS. Growth and turnover experiments with A. tumefaciens BY 6 indicated that the isomer R,S-IDS is the preferred substrate. The IDS-degrading enzyme system isolated from this organism consists of an IDS-epimerase and a C-N lyase. The C-N lyase is stereospecific for the cleavage of R,S-IDS, generating d-aspartic acid and fumaric acid. The decisive enzyme for S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS degradation is the epimerase. It transforms S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS into R,S-IDS. Both enzymes do not require any cofactors. The two enzymes were purified and characterized, and the N-termini were sequenced. The purified lyase and also the epimerase catalyzed the transformation of alkaline earth metal-IDS complexes, while heavy metal-IDS complexes were transformed rather slowly or not at all. The observed mechanism for the complete mineralization of all IDS isomers involving an epimerase offers an interesting possibility of funneling all stereoisomers into a catabolic pathway initiated by a stereoselective lyase...|$|E
40|$|The {{biodegradability}} {{of several}} potential endocrine disrupting compounds, namely 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -n-NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP 1 EO), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP 2 EO), bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), di-(2 -ethylhexyl) -phthalate (DEHP), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was evaluated in this study, using OECD method 301 F (<b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test) and activated sludge as inoculum. According to the results, 4 -n-NP and BPA meet the strict definition of ready biodegradability {{and they are}} not expected to be persistent during the activated sludge process. Partial biodegradation was observed for DEHP (58. 7 +/- 5. 7 %, n = 3). TCS (52. 1 +/- 8. 5 %, n = 3) and NP 1 EO (25. 9 +/- 8. 1 %, n = 3), indicating their possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems, while no biodegradation was observed for NP 2 EO, PFOA and PFNA. Experiments in the co-presence of a readily biodegradable compound showed the absence of co-metabolic phenomena during 4 -n-NP, BPA and TCS biodegradation. Using first order kinetics to describe biodegradation of the target compounds, half-lives of 4. 3 +/- 0. 6, 1. 3 +/- 0. 2, 1. 8 +/- 0. 5, 6. 9 +/- 2. 6 days were calculated for 4 -n-NP, BPA, TCS and DEHP, respectively. Toxicity tests using marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed that biodegradation of 4 -n-NP, NP 1 EO, BPA and TCS is a simultaneous detoxification process, while possible abiotic or biotic transformations of NP 2 EO, DEHP, PFOA and PFNA during respirometric test resulted to significant increase of their toxicities.

40|$|ABSTRACT One of {{the major}} {{ecological}} challenges on Lake Victoria resources is the existence of “hot spots”, caused by human waste, urban runoff, and industrial effluents. The lake is tending towards eutrophication which is attributed to the increasing human population in its watershed. A report of the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in environmental matrices of Lake Victoria is presented, and the management implication of perfluorinated compounds and similar potential organic pollutants examined. Two widely consumed and economically important fish species namely Lates niloticus (Nile perch) and Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) were obtained from Winam gulf of Lake Victoria, Kenya, and analysed for perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in muscles and liver using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. Variability in the concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulfonate in river waters (range perfluorooctanoic acid 0. 4 – 96. 4 ng/L and perfluorooctane sulfonate < 0. 4 – 13. 2 ng/L) was higher than for Lake waters (range perfluorooctanoic acid 0. 4 – 11. 7 ng/L and perfluorooctane sulfonate < 0. 4 – 2. 5 ng/L respectively). Significant correlations were tested between perfluorinated compounds levels in sediments, fish and water.

In this study, elevated concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate was found in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Kisumu, City of Kenya. An alternative analytical method to liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy for analysis of perfluorocarboxylic acids in abiotic and biotic matrices where high concentrations are expected is also presented. Derivatisation of the acid group to form a suitable alkyl ester provided a suitable compound for mass spectroscopy detection coupled to gas chromatography instrumental analysis. The acid is esterified by an alkyl halide i. e benzyl bromide as the alkylating agent for Perfluorocarboxylic acids quantification. The study also involved degradability measurements of emerging perfluorinated surfactants substitutes. The stability of the substitutes of perfluorinated surfactants was tested by employing advanced oxidation processes, followed by conventional tests, among them an automated method based on the <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> test and standardized fix bed bioreactor [FBBR] on perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), a fluoroethylene polymer, fluorosurfactant (Zonyl), two fluoraliphaticesters (NOVEC ™ FC 4430 and NOVEC ™ FC 4432) and 10 -(trifluoromethoxy) decane-sulfonate. Most of these emmerging surfactants are well-established in the market and have been used in several applications as alternatives to PFOS and PFOA based surfactants. The results of this study can be used as pioneer information for further studies on the sources, behaviour and fate of PFOA and PFOS and other related compounds in both abiotic and biota compartments of Lake Victoria and other lakes.
