40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{dynamics}} of land transactions, machine investments, {{and the demand for}} <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> using farm panel data from China. Recently, China's agriculture has experienced a large expansion of machine rentals and <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> provided by specialized agents, which has contributed to mechanization of agricultural production. On the other hand, the empirical results show that an increase in non-agricultural wage rates leads to expansion of self-cultivated land size. A rise in the proportion of non-agricultural income or the migration rate also increases the size of self-cultivated land. Interestingly, however, relatively educated farm households decrease the size of self-cultivated land, which suggests that relatively less educated farmers tend to specialize in farming. The demand for <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> has also increased if agricultural wage and migration rate increased over time, especially among relatively large farms. The results on crop income also support complementarities between rented-in land and <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> (demanded), which implies that scale economies are arising in Chinese agriculture with mechanization and active land rental markets.

40|$|Agricultural {{machines}} spend {{a significant}} part of their time on non-productive operations such as maneuvering near the boundaries of the field and loading or offloading of inputs or outputs (here referred to as servicing). This paper integrates existing methods for route optimization so as to minimize the time spent on turns and <b>machine</b> <b>servicing</b> on fields cultivated in straight rows. The following variables are optimized: (1) the orientation (angle) of the tracks, (2) the order of tracks, and (3) the types of turns between tracks. The angle of the tracks relative to field boundaries influences the number and lengths of the machine tracks, the number of turns and the positions where the <b>machine</b> can be <b>serviced.</b> Track order and the type of turns are selected to achieve overall efficiency. The algorithm was tested by computing routes for a set of fields of different sizes and assuming different operations. On small fields that do not require servicing, optimizing the turns between tracks resulted in a reduction of up to 50 % in turning time compared to the prevailing practice of navigation between adjacent tracks. A comparison of two sprayers in terms of servicing efficiency suggested that the algorithm can help selecting machinery for given field geometries. In some cases requiring <b>machine</b> <b>servicing,</b> the track orientation giving the shortest turning time did not produce the least servicing time. This illustrates that <b>machine</b> <b>servicing</b> should be taken into consideration for global optimization of machine traffic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Live {{migration}} of virtual machines {{has been a}} powerful tool to facilitate system maintenance, load balancing, fault tolerance, and power-saving, especially in clusters or data centers. Although pre-copy is a predominantly used approach {{in the state of}} the art, it is difficult to provide quick migra-tion with low network overhead, due to a great amount of transferred data during migration, leading to large performance degradation of virtual <b>machine</b> <b>services.</b> This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel memory-compression-based VM migration approach (MECOM) that first uses memory compression to provide fast, stable virtual machine migration, while guaranteeing the virtual <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> to be slightly affected. Based on memory page characteristics, we design an adaptive zero-aware compression algorithm for balancing the performance and the cost of virtual machine migration. Pages are quickly compressed in batches on the source and exactly recovered on the target. Experiment demonstrates that compared with Xen, our system can significantly reduce 27. 1 % of downtime, 32 % of total migration time and 68. 8 % of total transferred data on average. I...|$|E
