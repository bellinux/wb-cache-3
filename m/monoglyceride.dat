Thus, fatty acid derived <b>monoglycerides</b> represent important industrial products due to their emulsifying properties [15]. To obtain <b>monoglycerides</b> from rice bran oil is not trivial due {{to the presence of}} both free fatty acids and triglycerides in the starting material.|$|R

50|$|<b>Monoglycerides</b> are {{primarily}} used as surfactants, {{usually in the}} form of emulsifiers. Together with diglycerides, <b>monoglycerides</b> are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities as E471, which helps to prevent mixtures of oils and water from separating. The values given in the nutritional labels for total fat, saturated fat, and trans fat do not include those present in mono- and diglycerides as fats are defined as being triglycerides. They are also often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. In bakery products, <b>monoglycerides</b> are useful in improving loaf volume and texture, and as antistaling agents.|$|R
40|$|Free {{fatty acids}} and <b>monoglycerides</b> {{have long been}} known to possess broad-spectrum {{antibacterial}} activity {{that is based on}} lytic behavior against bacterial cell membranes. Considering the growing challenges of drug-resistant bacteria and the need for new classes of antibiotics, the wide prevalence, affordable cost, and broad spectrum of fatty acids and <b>monoglycerides</b> make them attractive agents to develop for healthcare and biotechnology applications. The aim of this review is to provide a brief introduction to the history of antimicrobial lipids and their current status and challenges, and to present a detailed discussion of ongoing research efforts to develop nanotechnology formulations of fatty acids and <b>monoglycerides</b> that enable superior in vitro and in vivo performance. Examples of nano-emulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and controlled release hydrogels are presented in order to highlight the potential that lies ahead for fatty acids and <b>monoglycerides</b> as next-generation antibacterial solutions.

50|$|The main {{function}} of hormone-sensitive lipase is {{to mobilize the}} stored fats. Mobilization and Cellular Uptake of Stored Fats (with Animation) HSL functions to hydrolyze the first fatty acid from a triacylglycerol molecule, freeing a fatty acid and diglyceride. It {{is also known as}} triglyceride lipase, while the enzyme that cleaves the second fatty acid in the triglyceride is known as diglyceride lipase, and the third enzyme that cleaves the final fatty acid is called <b>monoglyceride</b> lipase. Only the initial enzyme is affected by hormones, hence its hormone-sensitive lipase name. The diglyceride and <b>monoglyceride</b> enzymes are tens to hundreds of times faster, hence HSL is the rate-limiting step in cleaving fatty acids from the triglyceride molecule.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mono{{glycerides}}</b> (also: acylglycerols or monoacylglycerols) are a {{class of}} glycerides which are composed of a molecule of glycerol linked to a fatty acid via an ester bond. As glycerol contains both primary and secondary alcohol groups {{two different types of}} <b>monoglycerides</b> may be formed; 1-monoacylglycerols where the fatty acid is attached to a primary alcohol, or a 2-monoacylglycerols where the fatty acid is attached to the secondary alcohol.|$|R
50|$|Oleochemicals are {{important}} {{raw material for}} polymeric resins specially alkyd based because of possible functional group modifications. These modifications are based on reaction of vegetable oil with excess glycerol to obtain <b>monoglyceride,</b> which is then converted into polymeric resins i.e. alkyd by reacting with dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides. Recently polyesteramide resins are also prepared using vegetable oil as an oleochemical.|$|E
50|$|Lipases in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{play a critical}} role in fat digestion. More than 95% of fat in food consists of triglycerides, which are categorized based on the length of fatty acids connected to glyceride backbone. The length of long-chain triglycerides prevent their absorption through the intestinal mucosa. For that reason lipases in the {{gastrointestinal tract}} must hydrolyse it to smaller molecules, free fatty acids and <b>monoglyceride,</b> before absorption can occur.|$|E
50|$|Applications of {{neem oil}} in the {{preparation}} of polymeric resins have been documented in the recent reports. The synthesis of various alkyd resins from neem oil is reported using a <b>monoglyceride</b> (MG) route and their utilization for the preparation of PU coatings. The alkyds are prepared from reaction of conventional divalent acid materials like phthalic and maleic anhydrides with MG of neem oil. In other reports, different routes for preparation of polymeric resins from neem oil also are reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monoglycerides</b> are {{produced}} both biologically and industrially. They are naturally present {{at very low}} levels (0.1-0.2%) in some seed oils such as olive oil, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil. They are biosynthesized by the enzymatic hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase and the enzymatic hydrolysis of diglycerides by diacylglycerol lipase; or as an intermediate in the alkanoylation of glycerol to form fats. Several <b>monoglycerides</b> are pharmacologically active (e.g. 2-oleoylglycerol, 2-arachidonoylglycerol).|$|R
40|$|Monoacylglycerols as {{fruit juices}} preservatives. Czech J. food Sci., 30 : 567 - 572. Limiting or {{preventing}} {{the growth of}} undesirable microbial flora in food products {{is one of the}} main goals of food microbiology. A number of preservation methods have been designed to extend the shelf-life of the food products by reducing the microbial growth while new antimicrobials are still examined. <b>Monoglycerides</b> are naturally occurring compounds with inhibitory activity against various microorganisms. We evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 8 <b>monoglycerides</b> in vitro and in fresh unpasteurised apple juice. Out of all <b>monoglycerides</b> tested, monocaprin (MAG C 10 : 0) and monolaurin (MAG C 12 : 0) showed the best ability to supress or prevent the growth of filamentous fungi in vitro. The addition of these <b>monoglycerides</b> to apple juice resulted in a decrease in total viable counts of bacteria and yeasts.

30|$|Results {{obtained}} in the present work are very interesting if we consider that we obtain a mixture of mono- and di-glycerides starting from a mixture of fatty acids and triglycerides. Moreover mixtures with a concentration of 50  % of <b>monoglycerides</b> are already suitable for some purposes and also eligible as proper feed for an efficient molecular distillation, that is the process commonly employed to obtain mixtures with 90  % <b>monoglycerides</b> used in food application [15].|$|R

50|$|The {{dispersion}} of food fat into micelles provides a greatly {{increased surface area}} for {{the action of the}} enzyme pancreatic lipase, which actually digests the triglycerides, and is able to reach the fatty core through gaps between the bile salts. A triglyceride is broken down into three fatty acids and a <b>monoglyceride,</b> which are absorbed by the villi on the intestine walls. After being transferred across the intestinal membrane, the fatty acids reform into triglycerides (re-esterified), before being absorbed into the lymphatic system through lacteals. Without bile salts, most of the lipids in food would be excreted in faeces, undigested.|$|E
50|$|Neutral fats are {{produced}} by the dehydration synthesis {{of one or more}} fatty acids with an alcohol like glycerol. Many types of neutral fats are possible both because of the number and variety of fatty acids that could form part of it and because of the different bonding locations for the fatty acids. An example is a <b>monoglyceride</b> that has one fatty acid combined with glycerol, a diglyceride which has two fatty acids combined with glycerol or a triglyceride which has three fatty acids combined with glycerol. Neutral fats are usually found in the thigh and torso area of the body as padding and insulation to keep warm.|$|E
50|$|Lecithin, <b>monoglycerides,</b> diglycerides, and DATEM are {{considered}} emulsifiers. They disperse fat more evenly throughout the dough, helping it to trap {{more of the}} CO2 produced by yeast. Lecithin added {{at a rate of}} 0.25-to-0.6% of the flour weight acts as a dough conditioner. Based on total weight, egg yolk contains about 9% lecithin. <b>Monoglycerides</b> and diglycerides replace eggs in baked goods. Emulsifiers tend to produce a finer grain, softer crumb, and with longer proof times, increased baked volume.|$|R
50|$|To form {{a stable}} foam and emulsion, a surfactant, such as lecithin, <b>monoglycerides</b> or proteins, must be present {{to reduce the}} {{interfacial}} tension between the air-oil phase and the aqueous phase. If the surfactants are at equal concentrations at the interface, proteins are generally less effective than small surfactants, such as lecithin or <b>monoglycerides,</b> at decreasing the interfacial tension. Of course, {{this is not true}} of heated soybean or whey protein, which readily forms copious foam.|$|R
50|$|Glycerol {{has three}} {{hydroxyl}} functional groups, {{which can be}} esterified with one, two, or three fatty acids to form <b>monoglycerides,</b> diglycerides, and triglycerides.|$|R
50|$|Solketal is a {{protected}} form of glycerol with an isopropylidene acetal group joining two neighboring hydroxyl groups. Solketal contains a chiral {{center on the}} center carbon of the glycerol backbone, and so can be purchased as either the racemate or {{as one of the}} two enantiomers. Solketal has been used extensively in the synthesis of mono-, di- and triglycerides by ester bond formation. The free hydroxyl groups of solketal can be esterified with a carboxylic acid to form the protected <b>monoglyceride,</b> where the isopropylene group can then be removed using an acid catalyst in aqueous or alcoholic medium. The unprotected diol can then be esterified further to form either the di- or triglyceride.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Illustration of {{the process}} of lipolysis (in a fat cell) induced by high {{epinephrine}} and low insulin levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a beta-adrenergic receptor in the cell wall of the adipocyte, which causes cAMP to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a protein kinase, which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a hormone-sensitive lipase in the fat cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the fat stored in the fat droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood. Monoglycerides are hydrolyzed by <b>monoglyceride</b> lipase. The activity of hormone sensitive lipase is regulated by the circulation hormones insulin, glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, as shown in the diagram.|$|E
5000|$|Triglyceride {{digestion}} by endogenous lipases {{leads to}} hydrolysis of fatty acids from the triacylglyceride sn-1,3 positions, to release two fatty acids and one sn-2 <b>monoglyceride</b> into the intestinal lumen. The fatty acids configuration on the triglyceride {{has a major}} contribution to the efficacy of this nutrient absorption. While the unsaturated and short chain saturated free fatty acids are well absorbed regardless of their position, the absorption of free long chain saturated fatty acids, i.e. palmitic acid and longer, is relatively low. The main cause for this low absorption is their melting point above body temperature (~630 C), and thus high tendency to create complexes with dietary minerals, such as calcium or magnesium [...] which are secreted into feces leading to loss of both fatty acids (energy) and calcium. These complexes, also known as fatty acids soaps, are insoluble and therefore indigestible and positively related to stool hardness.|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is {{produced}} by transesterification of variable vegetable oils or animal fats with lower alcohols {{in the presence of}} alkali catalysts; the crude glycerol is the main by-product of this process. The amount of the crude glycerol formed during transesterification processes is about 100 kg per tonne of oil. We have developed the method for synthesis of <b>monoglycerides</b> from crude glycerol. The yiel of <b>monoglycerides</b> reaches 46. 8 %. The <b>monoglycerides</b> are valuable products for many applications - emulsifiers for both food and pharmaceutical industry, stabilizers in cosmetic industry; there is a large field in technical applications (e. g., modifying agents in the manufacturing of alkyd resins, detergents and other surface-active agents). Glycerolysis of fatty acids as well as triglycerides with crude glycerol (especially, if both raw materials are obtained as by-products) leads to more commercially viable biodiesel production...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} for the glycerolysis of palm stearin and crude glycerol derived from biodiesel process werefound to be a reaction temperature of 200 oC with a molar ratio of crude glycerol to palm stearin of 2. 5 : 1, and a reaction timeof 20 minutes. The yield and purity of <b>monoglycerides</b> obtained under these conditions was satisfactory as compared withthe glycerolysis of pure glycerol. To increase the purity of <b>monoglycerides</b> a two-step process, removal of residual glyceroland crystallization, was proposed instead of either vacuum or molecular distillation. Residual glycerol was removed byadding hydrochloric acid followed by washing with hot water. Optimum {{conditions for}} crystallization were achieved byusing isooctane as a solvent and a turbine impeller speed of 200 rpm at a crystallization temperature of 35 oC. A purity notexceeding 99 percent of <b>monoglycerides</b> was obtained with monopalmitin as the major product...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of ethyl esters, triglycerides, diglycerides, <b>monoglycerides</b> and glycerol between the ester and glycerol phase was investigated after the ethanolysis of rapeseed oil at various reaction conditions. The determination of these substances in the ester and glycerol phases {{was carried out}} by the GC method. The amount of ethyl esters in the glycerol phase was unexpectedly high and therefore the possibility of the reduction of this amount was investigated. The distribution coefficients and the weight distributions of each investigated substance were calculated and compared mutually. The distribution coefficients between the ester and glycerol phase increase in this sequence: glycerol, <b>monoglycerides,</b> diglycerides, ethyl esters and triglycerides. Soaps and <b>monoglycerides</b> in the reaction mixture cause a worse separation of ethyl esters from the reaction mixture. The existence of a non-separable reaction mixture was observed also, and its composition was determined...|$|R
