25|$|The Phytelephantoideae are a {{monoecious}} subfamily. Members of {{this group}} have distinct <b>monopodial</b> flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts.|$|E
25|$|Mucor plumbeus {{produces}} columella with distinctive, darkly pigmented, finger-like apical projections. Sporangiophores (structures bearing asexual spores) exhibit sympodial and <b>monopodial</b> branching. The {{appearance of}} sporangia of M. plumbeus changes throughout development from hyaline at first becoming dark brown colour at maturity. Sporangiospores are spherical, ranging from 5–7 to 8–10µm in diameter. Zygospores are also darkly coloured, though {{much larger than}} sporangiospores with an average diameter of approximately 85µm. Zygospores are ornamented with short star-shaped spines (length of 3µm). The mating system is heterothallic.|$|E
25|$|The {{inflorescence}} is compacted into a many-flowered spike, or {{a simple}} or branched raceme, and is apical, {{although it can}} seem axillary. Stems are <b>monopodial</b> (unbranched) until an inflorescence is formed, and then sympodial (potentially branched); this prevents the rosette from dying as in Agave. Flowers of all taxa within Aloeae are tubular and have some fusion of petal-like tepals, although the amount of fusion varies among genera. Differences in flower structure and colour among genera are considered to represent pollination syndromes, particularly shifts between insect and bird pollination, and so are less reliable indicators of relationships among species than was once thought. Thus Astroloba corrugata, like most species of Astroloba, has small, pale, horizontally held flowers that are insect-pollinated, whereas A.rubriflora has larger, red, vertically held flowers that are bird-pollinated.|$|E
25|$|Whether as shrubs, trees, or vines, palms {{have two}} methods of growth: solitary or clustered. The common {{representation}} {{is that of}} a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This <b>monopodial</b> character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include Washingtonia and Roystonea. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively sympodial genera include many of the rattans, Guihaia, and Rhapis. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters, and vice versa. These aberrations suggest the habit operates on a single gene.|$|E
500|$|An early {{example of}} ancient Indian plant {{classification}} {{is found in}} the Rigveda, a collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns from about 3700–3100 BP. Plants are divided into [...] (trees), [...] (herbs useful to humans) and [...] (creepers), with further subdivisions. The sacred Hindu text Atharvaveda divides plants into eight classes: [...] (spreading branches), [...] (leaves with long clusters), [...] (bushy plants), [...] (which expands); [...] (those with <b>monopodial</b> growth), [...] (creeping plants), [...] (with many stalks), and [...] (plants with knotty joints). The Taittiriya Samhita classifies the plant kingdom into , [...] and [...] (trees), [...] (shrubs with spreading branches), [...] (herbs), [...] (spreading plant), [...] (climber), [...] (bushy plant), [...] (creeper), and [...] (spreading on the ground). Other examples of early Indian taxonomy include Manusmriti, the Law book of Hindus, which classifies plants into eight major categories. Elaborate taxonomies also occur in the Charaka Samhitā, Sushruta Samhita and Vaisesika.|$|E
2500|$|Angraecum sesquipedale is a monocot with <b>monopodial</b> {{growth and}} can grow to {{a height of}} [...] [...] Its growth habit is rather similar to species in the genus Aerides. The leaves are dark green {{with a bit of}} a grayish tone and {{leathery}} with a bilobed tip. They are usually around [...] long and [...] wide. The roots are dark gray, thick, and emerge from the orchid's stem. There tend to be few roots and they attach to the bark of the trees quite strongly. Each of the succulent roots can extend along the trunk of the tree for several meters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eastern hemlock}} grows well in shade {{and is very}} long lived, with the oldest {{recorded}} specimen, found in Tionesta, Pennsylvania, being at least 554 years old. [...] The tree generally reaches heights of about , but exceptional trees have been recorded up to [...] The diameter of the trunk at breast height is often , but again, outstanding trees have been recorded up to [...] The trunk is usually straight and <b>monopodial,</b> but very rarely is forked. The crown is broadly conic, while the brownish bark is scaly and deeply fissured, especially with age. The twigs are a yellow-brown in colour with darker red-brown pulvini, and are densely pubescent. The buds are ovoid in shape and are very small, measuring only [...] in length. These are usually not resinous, but may be slightly so.|$|E
2500|$|All living {{conifers}} are woody plants, {{and most}} are trees, the majority having <b>monopodial</b> growth form (a single, straight trunk with side branches) with strong apical dominance. Many conifers have distinctly scented resin, secreted to protect the tree against insect infestation and fungal infection of wounds. Fossilized resin hardens into amber. The size of mature conifers varies from less than one meter, to over 100 meters. The world's tallest, thickest, largest, and oldest living trees are all conifers. The tallest is a Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), with a height of 115.55 meters (although one Victorian mountain ash, Eucalyptus regnans, allegedly grew to a height of 140 meters, although the exact dimensions were not confirmed). [...] The thickest, or tree with the greatest trunk diameter, is a Montezuma Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), 11.42 meters in diameter. [...] The largest tree by three-dimensional volume is a Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), with a volume 1486.9 cubic meters. The smallest is the pygmy pine (Lepidothamnus laxifolius) of New Zealand, which is seldom taller than 30cm when mature. The oldest is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva), 4,700 years old.|$|E
5000|$|Vascular {{plants with}} <b>monopodial</b> growth habits grow upward {{from a single}} point. They add leaves to the apex each year and the stem grows longer accordingly. The word <b>Monopodial</b> is derived from Greek [...] "mono-", one and [...] "podial", [...] "foot", in {{reference}} to the fact that <b>monopodial</b> plants have a single trunk or stem.|$|E
50|$|Strong <b>monopodial</b> {{growth is}} exhibited.|$|E
50|$|Aeranthes has {{a single}} short, erect, <b>monopodial</b> stem. The leathery, shining, {{opposite}} leaves are arranged in two rows of five to seven leaves, with a length of 15-25 cm. New leaves are formed {{at the top of}} the stem in a <b>monopodial</b> growth pattern.|$|E
50|$|Orchids with <b>monopodial</b> growth often produce copious aerial {{roots that}} often hang down in long drapes and have green {{chlorophyll}} underneath the grey root coverings, {{which are used}} as additional photosynthetic organs. They {{do not have a}} rhizome or pseudobulbs so species adapted to dry periods have fleshy succulent leaves instead. Flowers generally come from the stem between the leaves. With some <b>monopodial</b> species, the stem (the rhizome) might fork into two, but for all <b>monopodial</b> orchids this is not necessary for continued growth, as opposed to orchids with sympodial growth.|$|E
