500|$|The {{conceptualization}} stages {{were important}} for Pei, presenting a need {{and an opportunity}} to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: [...] "I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again—just as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me." ...|$|E
500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm as Flora Poste, a newly {{orphaned}} 1930s socialite sent {{to live with}} distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of [...] "the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as [...] "yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role [...] "with the perfect snippy aplomb." [...] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office. Also in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she [...] "holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise." [...] 1995 also saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. [...] "He was the young lion of the theatre." [...] "I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met." [...] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that [...] "the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on." [...] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays; Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|In Recollections of Sheilah Graham, her daughter, Wendy Fairey, wrote: [...] "Entering this {{institution}} at age six, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> her golden hair shaved to the scalp {{as a precaution}} against lice.

Eight years later when she 'graduated,' she had established herself as Norwood's [...] "Head Girl": captain of the cricket team and recipient of many prizes, including both the Hebrew prize and a prize for reciting a poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning". Graham, then still known as Lily, had been trained for a career in teaching. When she left the orphanage, her mother was dying of cancer, and Graham returned home to care for her.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophers such as Aquinas use {{the concept}} of individuation. They argue that {{abortion}} is not permissible from {{the point at which}} individual human identity is realized. Anthony Kenny argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say [...] "if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" [...] then one can reasonably infer that at six months the [...] "me" [...] in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.|$|E
2500|$|According to Nathalie Babel Brown, [...] "Babel came to Paris in {{the summer}} of 1935, as part of the {{delegation}} of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E

2500|$|After a time {{living in}} one of the {{imperial}} residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsar's family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, [...] "a touching man" [...] who told how difficult was the life of her son's family in Yekaterinburg. [...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." [...] She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal." [...] Maria's daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter, [...] "Yet I am sure that deep in her heart <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death." ...|$|E
2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father.

However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> deeply shaken me.

As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo.
