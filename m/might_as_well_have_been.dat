25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much it <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Australian {{team was}} knocked out of the tournament {{as a result of}} a {{controversial}} penalty given against defender Lucas Neill in their Second round match against Italy, Australian assistant coach Graham Arnold was quoted as saying, [...] "We are a small footballing nation that gets no favours.

2500|$|HAP {{never had}} any {{explicit}} policy advocating segregation; nonetheless, for various reasons de facto segregation was the norm. [...] Whites complained when placed near “black” areas, and segregation of Vanport by neighborhood <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> enforced legally. Only in 1944 were complaints raised about the segregation situation in the city. [...] Reacting to the criticism—and pressure from Eleanor Roosevelt—by April 1944, HAP began placing incoming blacks into the “white” areas of the settlement. [...] However, word quickly spread and 63white residents quickly signed a petition demanding {{a reversal of the}} policy. [...] Entire buildings were free in the “black” areas of town, they argued, and after opponents of the integration [...] plan appeared at a HAP meeting the authority decided to resume its previous policies.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic John Bush {{wrote the}} {{compilation}} [...] "could {{well be the}} most influential document of the '50s folk revival. Many of the recordings that appeared on it had languished in obscurity for 20 years, and it proved a revelation to {{a new group of}} folkies, from Pete Seeger to John Fahey to Bob Dylan... Many of the most interesting selections on the Anthology, however, are taken from [...] artists... such as Clarence Ashley, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and Buell Kazee." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau wrote [...] "Harry Smith's act of history... aces two very '90s concepts: the canon that accrues as rock gathers commentary, and the compilations that multiply as labels recycle catalogue. In its time, it wrested the idea of the folk from ideologues and ethnomusicologists by imagining a commercial music of everyday pleasure and alienation--which <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conceived to merge with a rock and roll that didn't yet exist... Somebody you know is worth the 60 bucks it'll run you. So are you." [...] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, said that the songs [...] "still sound marvelous and uncanny." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 21 {{years of}} age he was {{diagnosed}} as having bipolar disorder, and has spoken candidly about his experiences {{with the effects of}} the illness. In his 31 December 2010 interview for The Sun, Ant also discussed the side effects of medication for his bipolar condition: [...] "In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him". During an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, he declared that [...] "mental health needs a great deal of attention. It's the final taboo {{and it needs to be}} faced and dealt with." [...] Ant is involved in the Black Dog campaign, which promotes better understanding of mental illness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} parts of it, Boborykin opined, <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{published}} by Sovremennik; in fact, the latter's envoys visited Pisemsky, with this in mind. [...] "These two parts I've heard recited by the author himself and by them nobody could have guessed that the novel {{would turn out to}} be so unpleasant for the younger generation," [...] Boborykin wrote. Skabichevsky doubted the chronology, though, reminding that in the end of 1862 Pisemsky was already in Moscow. According to his theory, the novel's first two parts might have been ready by the late 1861 when, despite strained relations between the journal and the author the latter still wasn't known as 'an irreconcilable reactionary', the label it given him in early 1862. The second part, written after the break, was extraordinarily vicious in tone. In general, the novel showed Russian society in the most miserable light, as a [...] "sea of grief", harbouring beneath the surface [...] "vile monsters and anemic fishes amongst stinking sea-weed." [...] The novel, where the ugliest characters turned out to be political radicals, naturally received [...] negative reviews, not only in the democratic press (Maxim Antonovich in Sovremennik, Varfolomey Zaitsev in Russkoye Slovo) but also in the centrist magazines like Otechestvennye Zapiski which denounced Troubled Seas as a rude caricature of the new generation.|$|E
