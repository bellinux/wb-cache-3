An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E
25|$|On one wall, {{there is}} a stylized steam {{locomotive}} mosaic.

25|$|The {{original}} one-story wing on {{the north}} end of the residence includes a <b>mechanical</b> <b>room,</b> bedroom, and bath. In the mid-1960s, Presley enlarged the house to create a den known as Jungle Room which features an indoor waterfall of cut field stone {{on the north}} wall. In 1976, the Jungle Room was converted into a recording studio, where Presley recorded the bulk of his final two albums, From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee and Moody Blue; these were his final known recordings in a studio setting. During the mid-1960s expansion of the house, Presley constructed a large wing on the south side of the main house that was a sidewalk, between the music room in the original one-story wing and the swimming pool area, that connected to the house by a small enclosed gallery. The new wing initially housed a slot car track and to store his many items of appreciation, but was later remodeled to what is now known as the Trophy Building. The Trophy Building now features an exhibit about the Presley family, and it includes Priscilla's wedding dress, Elvis' wedding tuxedo, Lisa Marie's toy chest and baby clothes and more.|$|E
50|$|Tunnel {{access points}} {{tend to be}} in locked <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms</b> where steam pipes and other {{utilities}} enter a building, and through manholes. As with roofs, explorers bypass locks to enter <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms</b> and the connected tunnels. Some adventurers may open manholes from above with crowbars or specialized manhole-opening hooks.|$|R

500|$|The {{building}} cost $250,000 ($ in [...] ). At its completion, architect George Percy described Greystone Cellars {{as the largest}} wine cellar in California, if not the world. Greystone {{was also the first}} California winery to be operated and illuminated by electricity, produced by a boiler and gas generator located in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>room</b> below the building's central front wing. In the spring of 1894, a long-lasting phylloxera scourge made Bourn decide the winery was no longer profitable.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{winds were}} {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island, with gusts reaching more than , while rainfall was relatively heavy, with a peak of [...] in Prince County. At another location, Charlottetown, precipitation totals only reached [...] Although potato fields were inundated by water, minimal damage occurred to that crop. In Summerside at least five roads were closed due to flooding and water entered the <b>mechanical</b> <b>room</b> via the telephone and electrical conduit at the local intermediate school. Road infrastructure was also affected, such as in Howlan, where a bridge slightly longer than [...] washed away. Restrictions were imposed {{on the use of}} the Confederation Bridge during the height of the storm. Adverse conditions also prevented the Northumberland Ferry from docking in Prince Edward Island, causing it to return to Nova Scotia.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two rooms}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the building. Both are approximately 12 feet by 12 feet.

50|$|Swanson Junior High School, {{built by}} {{contractor}} E. A. Pessagnolo for {{a cost of}} $200,941, opened in 1939 on land formerly occupied by the A. Duke Torreyson family farm. In 1955, a large addition off the North side was constructed to add classroom space. In 1963 and 1968, the central courtyard of the original design was filled in via two additions which accommodated a gymnasium, classrooms, a library, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The bridge {{contains}} 120 spans {{and has an}} 80-foot double leaf bascule span {{that opens}} for maritime traffic. The official NJDOT Historic Bridge Survey states that the substructure has been heavily reconstructed.

Access to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms</b> were denied for the final bridge inspection, but topside inspection reveals that the bascule appears heavily altered and thus is not eligible for historic preservation.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>room</b> or {{a boiler}} {{room is a}} room or space in a {{building}} dedicated to the mechanical equipment and its associated electrical equipment, as opposed to rooms intended for human occupancy or storage. Unless a building is served by a centralized heating plant, {{the size of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>room</b> is usually proportional {{to the size of the}} building. A small building or home may have at most a utility room but in large buildings mechanical rooms can be of considerable size, often requiring multiple rooms throughout the building, or even occupying one or more complete floors (see: mechanical floor).|$|E

50|$|The Marlowe School is a two story brick {{building}} on a concrete base. As originally built there were four rooms {{on each of the}} two main levels, with a cafeteria and <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms</b> in the basement. Each classroom was provided with a coatroom.

5000|$|Fenwick Tower {{consists}} of 33 storeys, not including an elevator control {{room at the}} top, also containing an east-facing webcam run by the Chebucto Community Net. During the Dalhousie period of ownership, the 32nd and 33rd floors were used for international exchange students, as well as hearing and speech clinics associated with the School of Human Communication Disorders, which also occupied the [...] "PR" [...] floor (the first underground floor).

25|$|The center houses offices, <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{and waiting}} areas for the arch trams, {{as well as}} its main attractions: the Museum of Westward Expansion and two theaters {{displaying}} films about the arch. The older theater opened in May 1972; the newer theater, called the Odyssey Theatre, was constructed in the 1990s and features a four-story-tall screen. Its construction required the expansion of the underground complex, and workers had to excavate solid rock while keeping the disruption to a minimum so the museum could remain open. The museum houses several hundred exhibits about the United States' westward expansion in the 19th century and opened on August 10, 1977.|$|R
50|$|According to Sir Terry Farrell, the MTR {{initially}} {{wanted a}} dispersed train station with discreet entrances, but he {{argued for a}} grand station hall concept with layered space oriented around Kowloon Station providing a central focal point. Transport infrastructure occupies the underground level and first floor - loading facilities and platforms for MTR trains on the Tung Chung and the Airport Express lines occupy the sub-terranean level, while the ground level has bus stations, parking garage entrances and <b>mechanical</b> <b>rooms.</b> The Elements Mall on the upper decks take up , with retail space occupied by luxury brands, chain stores, a cinema, a supermarket, restaurants, and an ice-rink.|$|R
