50|$|Plate-type marine heat {{exchangers}} {{are designed with}} sets of multiple parallel plates that are compressed to form the <b>main</b> <b>cooler</b> unit. This type has a small foot print in comparison to other types of {{heat exchangers}}. The plates are designed {{in such a way}} that when placed next to each other they create passageways to the fluid to flow between the plates. Gaskets are placed around the edge of each plate in order to prevent the mixing of the two fluids. Due to the temperature and pressure constraints of the rubber used to make the gaskets plate type heat exchangers are used for low pressure, low temperature applications, under 290 psig and 300 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal power {{stations}} on the electric grid use fuel to produce electricity. However, {{there are large}} quantities of waste heat produced which often go unused. In other situations, high-grade fuel is burned at high temperature for a low temperature application. According to the second law of thermodynamics, a heat engine can generate power from this temperature difference. In a CHP system, the high temperature primary heat enters the Stirling engine heater, then some of the energy is converted to mechanical power in the engine, and the rest passes through to the cooler, where it exits at a low temperature. The [...] "waste" [...] heat actually comes from engine's <b>main</b> <b>cooler,</b> and possibly from other sources such as the exhaust of the burner, if there is one.|$|E

40|$|The Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou is an ion cooler {{storage ring}} {{facility}} in Chinaâ€™s Institute of Modern Physics. The beams are accumulated, electron cooled, accelerated, and {{extracted from the}} <b>main</b> <b>cooler</b> storage ring (CSRm) to the experimental ring or different terminals. The heavy ion beams are easily lost at the vacuum chamber along the CSRm when {{it is used to}} accumulate intermediate charge state particles. The vacuum pressure bump due to the ion-induced desorption in turn leads to an increase in beam loss rate. In order to avoid the complete beam loss, the collimation system is investigated and planned to be installed in the CSRm. First, the beam loss distribution is simulated considering the particle charge exchanged process. Then the collimation efficiency of the lost particles is calculated and optimized under different position and geometry of the collimators and beam emittance and so on. Furthermore, the beam orbit distortion that is caused by different types of errors in the ring will affect the collimation efficiency. The linearized and inhomogeneous equations of particle motion with these errors are derived and solved by an extended transfer matrix method. Actual magnet alignment errors are adopted to investigate the collimation efficiency of the lost particles in the CSRm. Estimation of the beam loss positions and optimization of the collimation system is completed by a newly developed simulation program...|$|E
40|$|A room {{temperature}} heavy ion linac {{has been proposed}} as a new injector of CSRm (the <b>main</b> <b>Cooler</b> Storage Ring) at HIRFL (Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou), {{which is expected to}} improve the performance of HIRFL. The linac injector can supply heavy ion with maximum mass to charge ratio of 7 and injection kinetic energy of 7. 272 MeV/u for CSRm, and the pulsed beam intensity is 3 emA with the duty factor of 3 %. Compared with the present cyclotron injector SFC (Sector Focusing Cyclotron), the beam current from linac can be improved by 10 - 100 times. As the pre-accelerator of the linac, the 108. 48 MHz 4 -rod RFQ accelerates ion beam from 4 keV/u to 300 keV/u, which achieves the transmission efficiency of 95. 3 % with 3. 07 m long vanes. The phase advance has been taken into account to analysis the error tolerance, and parametric resonance have been carefully avoided by adjusting the structure parameters. KONUS IH-DTLs, which follow the RFQ, accelerate the ions up to the energy of 7. 272 MeV/u and inject into HIRFL-CSRm. The resonance frequency is 108. 48 MHz for the first two cavities and 216. 96 MHz for the last 5 DTLs. The maximum accelerating gradient can reach 4. 95 MV/m in DTL section with the length of 17. 066 m, and the total pulsed RF power is 2. 8 MW. A new strategy, for the determination of resonance frequency, RFQ vane voltage and DTL effective accelerating voltage, is described in detail. The beam dynamics design of the linac will be present in this paper...|$|E
