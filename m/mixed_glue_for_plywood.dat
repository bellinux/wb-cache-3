30|$|<b>Gluing</b> {{conditions}} <b>for</b> <b>plywood</b> production {{were not}} optimized for each adhesive, but were set at these {{conditions on the}} assumption that the adhesive would completely cure. Three-ply plywood samples were prepared by bonding radiata pine veneers (250  mm[*]×[*] 250  mm[*]×[*] 3  mm) conditioned to 4 % moisture content. Each of the adhesives was applied at a spread rate of 200  g/m 2 in a single glue line. The spread panels were prepressed at room temperature at 1.0  MPa for 30  min. All panels were then pressed at 135  °C at 1.0  MPa for 10  min.|$|R

50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a <b>glue</b> <b>for</b> waterproof <b>plywood.</b> It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a resole phenolic resin. When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated plywood was formed. Most plywood at this time used other adhesives, such as casein. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses. This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{aimed at}} finding some {{fast-setting}} <b>glues</b> <b>for</b> exterior <b>plywood</b> and particleboard based on diisocyanates {{in combination with}} compounds from renewable resources like tannins, proteins, and starches revelaed the following: The mechanical properties of particleboard bonded with unmodified tannin extracts from spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) were inferior. The fortification of the tannin extracts with diisocyanate increased the bonding strength and reduced the thickness swelling. With one exception, particleboards bonded with nonemulsifiable diisocyanate modfied with glutin or maize starch (extender content up to 20 %) had exteriorgrade quality (German standard V 100 for flat-pressed boards). Veneer plywood, which is conditionally weatherproof (German standard AW), can be produced by applying diisocyanate together with tannins or starches. The veneer wood species, the glue mixtures, the pressing conditions, and the fillers have to be adjusted to the diisocyanat e type and the extender. Modified, emulsifiable diisocyanate gave plywood with better strength and wood failure than glue formulations with nonemulsifiable diisocyanat...|$|R

The travel prints generally depict travelers along famous routes experiencing the special attractions of various stops along the way.

In 1856, working with the publisher Uoya Eikichi, he created a series of luxury edition prints, made with the finest printing techniques including true gradation of color, the addition of mica to lend a unique iridescent effect, embossing, fabric printing, blind printing, {{and the use of}} glue printing (wherein ink is <b>mixed</b> with <b>glue</b> <b>for</b> a glittery effect). Hiroshige pioneered the use of the vertical format in landscape printing in his series Famous Views of the Sixty-odd Provinces. One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (issued serially between 1856 and 1859) was immensely popular. The set was published posthumously and some prints had not been completed [...] he had created over 100 on his own, but two were added by Hiroshige II after his death.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the molecular weight {{and the type of}} gelatin (A or B), as well as the molecular weight of poly (gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA), on the properties of gelatin/gamma-PGA mixed bioadhesives were studied. The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological <b>glues.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of gamma-PGA or gelatin increased. The swelling ratio decreased and the denaturation temperature increased upon raising the EDC concentration, indicating a greater degree of crosslinking at higher EDC concentrations. The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> crosslinked with various concentrations of EDC (1. 7 - 2. 5 %) showed no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. In addition, no significant inflammatory response was observed in the rat subcutaneous implantation. The bioadhesives based on gelatin/gamma-PGA remained at the site for 7 days while the fibrin glue had almost completely degraded. By choosing the appropriate gelatin type and higher molecular weight gamma-PGA in the mixtures, the gelatin/gamma-PGA biological glues could serve as soft tissue adhesives.
