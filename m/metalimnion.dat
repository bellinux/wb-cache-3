50|$|A {{thermocline}} (also {{known as}} the thermal layer or the <b>metalimnion</b> in lakes) is a thin but distinct layer in {{a large body of}} fluid (e.g. water, such as an ocean or lake, or air, such as an atmosphere) in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does in the layers above or below. In the ocean, the thermocline divides the upper mixed layer from the calm deep water below. Depending largely on season, latitude and turbulent mixing by wind, thermoclines may be a semi-permanent feature of the body of water in which they occur or they may form temporarily in response to phenomena such as the radiative heating/cooling of surface water during the day/night. Factors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include seasonal weather variations, latitude and local environmental conditions, such as tides and currents.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Whatcom is a {{monomictic}} lake. The {{water body}} is stratified {{for part of}} the year (late spring through mid-fall) and mixed during the rest. This phenomenon is important to the hydrology of the lake. The top layer of water (epilimnion) is warmed by the sun and sits atop the <b>metalimnion</b> (also a thermocline). In this middle layer water temperatures take a pronounced decline and eventually a distinct third layer forms (hypolimnion), much colder and isolated {{from the rest of the}} water body. Minimal oxygen from the air diffuses down to the hypolimnion, causing very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This combined with sediment oxidation, cause for near or complete anoxic conditions in the deeper levels of the lake. This stratification is more pronounced in Basin 3 where water is deepest. This layering of the lake, as well as the distinct physical barriers (sills) between basins cause for slow movement of water through the lake. (Ecology TMDL, 2008) ...|$|E

In the limnocorrals with zooplankton, epilimnetic macrozooplankton biomass was 2 � higher and estimated grazing rates were 1. 8 � higher than those in the <b>metalimnion.</b> After 11 d, chlorophyll levels in the zooplankton treatment declined 72 % in the epilimnion but only 53 % in the <b>metalimnion,</b> leading to the maintenance of the DCL.

Biologically mediated movement of 15 N from the epilimnion and <b>metalimnion</b> was downward, into either the <b>metalimnion</b> or the hypolimnion.

Waters of the <b>metalimnion</b> and hypolimnion were anoxic to euxinic, and there was a downward decrease of susceptibility and ARM in the <b>metalimnion,</b> where dissolved oxygen was depleted (Fig.  4). The total organic carbon (TOC) contents of bottom sediments at water depths greater than 5  m were generally very high (4 to 9  %).

The {{aim of the research}} was to employ the novel high-resolution profiler in studying the dynamics of the thermal structure of the Dead Sea and the related proc-esses including the investigation of the <b>metalimnion</b> fluctuations. The 18 cm resolution profiling system was placed vertically through the water column supported by a buoy 450 m from shore, from 2 m above to 53 m below the water surface (just above the local seafloor), covering the entire seasonal upper layer (the <b>metalimnion</b> had an average depth of 20 m). Temperature profiles were recorded every 5 min. The May to July 2012 data set allowed quantitative investigation of the thermal morphology dynamics, including objec-tive definitions of key locations within the <b>metalimnion</b> based on the temperature depth profile and its first and second depth derivatives. Analysis of the fluctuation of the defined <b>metalimnion</b> locations showed strong anticorrelation to measured sea level fluctuations. The slope of the sea level versus <b>metalimnion</b> depth was found {{to be related to the}} density ratio of the upper layer and the underlying main water body, according to the prediction of a two-layer model.

40|$|The most {{prominent}} responses of Lake Zurich to climate warming include {{the increase of}} surface water temperatures, a reduced depth of spring mixing, and the persistent thriving of the harmful cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, a low-light adapted species concentrating in the <b>metalimnion</b> during summer. To study changes of its habitat, we assessed the spatio-temporal metalimnetic boundaries by applying low-pass filtering and binary thresholding to temperature profiles of long-term data (1978 – 2013, weekly measurements). Due to increasing temperatures over the last 3. 5 decades, the onset and duration of <b>metalimnion</b> formation changed significantly (stratification increased by 33 days). Moreover, the upper metalimnetic boundary has undergone a significant drawdown of 2. 3 m, accounting for an overall decrease in <b>metalimnion</b> thickness. Being the most abundant species in this zone, P. rubescens was not negatively affected by altered temporal or spatial stratification patterns during its phase of net growth (July–September), as the zone of its optimal light-dependent buoyancy was still located within the <b>metalimnion.</b> The biomass of P. rubescens in August was even significantly related to increasing temperatures. Nevertheless, a further depression of the metalimnetic top boundary may eventually restrict P. rubescens by forcing it into layers of unfavourable light conditions or into the turbulent epilimnetic zone...|$|E

Analysis of the community from May 1975 to April 1976 revealed that zooplankton maintain high populations within the <b>metalimnion</b> during summer stratification. The species composition of the community changes noticeably during the summer, but due to advanced stages excysting from resting forms, a complete assemblage of individuals are found throughout the 74 day period studied. Thermal stratification was weak, covering a 30 meter <b>metalimnion.</b> Eddy currents powered by wind action brought oxygen into this zone from the surface, and mixing at the metalimnion-hypolimnion due to internal waves and density flows brought oxygen up into this zone.

40|$|Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is {{the major}} {{volatile}} reduced organic sulfur compound {{in the water column}} of coastal Salt Pond, Cape Cod, MA. DMS concentration and vertical distributions vary seasonally in response to changing biogeochemical processes in the pond. When the pond is thermally stratified in summer, maximum DMS concentrations of up to 60 nmol/l were found in the oxygen-deficient <b>metalimnion.</b> DMS concentrations in the epilimnion (typically 5 - 10 nmol/l) were always an order of magnitude higher than in the hypolimnion (less than 0. 2 nmol/l). The most likely precursor for DMS is algal dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which showed vertical profiles similar to those of DMS. Laboratory experiments show that microorganisms in the pond, especially in the <b>metalimnion,</b> are capable of decomposing DMSP to DMS, while photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in the hypolimnion can consume DMS.

Aquatic systems are particularly sensitive to high nutrient loading, and denitrification occurring in small lakes accounts for half the global release of dinitrogen. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether mixing events within the <b>metalimnion</b> increase denitrification rates. It was hypothesized that mixing events bring oxygen from the epilimnion and ammonium from the hypolimnion, simulating a coupled nitrification-denitrification process in the <b>metalimnion.</b> The dinitrogen-nitrogen (N 2 -N) concentration for three treatments of 0, 50, and 90 % hypolimnion water samples represented mixing within the <b>metalimnion</b> and were measured to determine denitrification rates. The nitrate (NO 3 -) concentration was tested in order to determine if the insurgence of oxygen from a mixing event would increase nitrification and lead to a coupled nitrification-denitrification cycle. The results showed that denitrification occurred within the metalimnion; however, the 0 % and 50 % hypolimnion treatments had similar N 2 -N concentrations. The 90 % hypolimnion treatment declined in N 2 -N concentration. Lack of increases in NO 3 - concentrations indicates that any products of nitrification proceeded directly to denitrification or microbial assimilation. The results show that the <b>metalimnion</b> of a reservoir can be a hotspot for denitrification, and provides opportunities for future studies to investigate the potential of metalimnetic denitrification.

Here, we report results of an integrative study on the successional trajectories of bacterial communities in a seasonally stratified lake with an anoxic hypolimnion. The bacterial community composition of epilimnion, <b>metalimnion,</b> and hypolimnion diverged during summer stratification and converged when the lake was mixed. In contrast, bacterial communities in the sediment remained relatively stable over the year. Phototrophic Cyanobacteria and heterotrophic Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Planktomycetes were abundant in the aerobic epilimnion, Gammaproteobacteria (mainly Chromatiaceae) dominated in the <b>metalimnion,</b> and Chlorobi, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes were abundant in the anoxic sulfidic hypolimnion. Anoxic but nonsulfidic conditions expanded to the surface layer during fall turnover, when the epilimnion, <b>metalimnion</b> and upper hypolimnion mixed. During this period, phototrophic sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae and Chlorobi) disappeared, Polynucleobacter (Betaproteobacteria) and Methylobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) spread out from the former meta- and hypolimnion to the surface layer, and Epsilonproteobacteria dominated in the bottom water layer.

An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the <b>metalimnion.</b> In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the <b>metalimnion</b> would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0 % to 87 % and[*]<[*] 1 % to 92 %, respectively. Nonetheless, the <b>metalimnion</b> of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume.

Clearance rates of HNF for the microspheres ranged between 1. 3 and 4. 5 nl cell 21 h 21, but the average rate did not differ between day and night. In contrast, clear diel changes were observed in the clearance rate of Cryptomonas sp. in the epilimnion from, 0. 5 nl cell 21 h 21 at midnight to. 3 nl cell 21 h 21 at noon. In the <b>metalimnion</b> where light intensity was lower, however, the clearance rate of Cryptomonas sp. was always, 0. 5 nl cell 21 h 21 through the study period. Thus, bacterial ingestion of Cryptomonas sp. is not to acquire supplementary energy or carbon at low phototrophic activities.

For this purpose, concentrations of the anthropogenic trace gas chlorofluorocarbon- 12 (CFC- 12) were measured in water samples which were collected in glass ampoules and analyzed by a new gas chromatographic separation method. Based on measurements of stored duplicate samples, we conclude that the first-order degradation rate for CFC- 12 in anoxic water of Lake Malawi/Nyasa lies in the range 0 to 0. 012 yr- 1. The tracer measurements are used in a 3 -box mixing model from which average exchange times between the hypolimnion and the <b>metalimnion</b> of 18. 5 years and 15. 9 years are calculated for the cases of no degradation and maximum degradation in anoxic water, respectively. These exchange times are 2. 7 to 2. 2 times higher than have been estimated previously based on tritium measurements in 1976 by Gonfiantini and coworkers. The exchange times between the <b>metalimnion</b> and the epilimnion are calculated to be 3. 7 years and 3. 4 years, again for no degradation and maximum degradation, respectively.

In contrast, [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was highest in the epilimnion. The ratios of incorporation into DNA/protein averaged 2. 2, 0. 49, and 0. 95 for the epilimnion, <b>metalimnion,</b> and hypolimnion, respectively. Low incorporation into DNA was not due to artifacts associated with the DNA isolation procedure. Recovery of added [3 H]DNA was about 90 % in waters in which the portion of [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was about 40 %. At least some obligate anaerobic bacteria were capable of assimilating thymidine since aeration of anaerobic hypolimnion waters substantially inhibited thymidine incorporation. The depth profile of bacterial production estimated from total thymidine and leucine incorporation and the frequency of dividing cells were all similar, with maximal rates in the <b>metalimnion.</b> However, estimates of bacterial production based on frequency of dividing cells and leucine incorporation were usually significantly higher than estimates based on thymidine incorporation (using conversion factors from the literature), especially in anaerobic hypolimnion waters.

By using a grazer-free mixed bacterial population from the lake in continuous culture, an empirical relationship between cell production and thymidine incorporation was established. Thymidine incorporation into total cold-trichloroacetic-acid-insoluble macromolecules yielded a relatively constant empirical conversion factor of ca. 1018 (range, 0. 38 × 1018 to 1. 42 × 1018) bacteria mol of thymidine− 1 at specific growth rates (μ) ranging from 0. 007 to 0. 116 h− 1. Although thymidine incorporation has been assumed to measure DNA synthesis thymidine incorporation appeared to underestimate the independently measured bacterial DNA synthesis by at least 1. 5 - to 13 -fold, even if all incorporated label was assumed to be in DNA. However, incorporation into DNA was found to be insignificant as measured by conventional acid-base hydrolysis. Methodological problems of the thymidine technique are discussed. Like the cultures, Lake Vechten bacteria showed considerable thymidine incorporation into total macromolecules, but no significant incorporation into DNA was found by acid-base hydrolysis. This applied not only to the low-oxygen hypo- and <b>metalimnion</b> but also to the aerobic epilimnion. Thus, the established empirical conversion factor for thymidine incorporation into total macromolecules was used to estimate bacterial production.

Holland Lake, a Twin Cities Metro Area lake, with a {{surface area of}} 0. 14 km 2 and a maximum depth of about 61 ft (18, 8 m) is located in Dakota County, The lake has two shallow subbasins with {{a substantial amount of}} rooted vegetation and a deep subbasin, which is thermally suitable for brown trout, However, due to a high oxygen depletion rate in summer, the lake becomes anoxic below the surface mixed layer, A combination of high water temperatures in the surface mixed layer and low dissolved oxygen below the surface mixed layer makes it difficult for brown trout to survive in summer, For possible future aeration of the lake, the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of the lake were studied. Historical records show that DO depletes at a rate of 0. 47 mg. l"]. day-] after spring oveliu 11 l in the upper stratum of the <b>metalimnion</b> (from 10 to 20 ft depth), such that the lake develops a negative heterograde DO profile by early July. DO depletes at a lower rate (0. 22 mg. 1 "]. day-I) in the lower stratum of the metalinmion (from 20 to 30 ft depth). By mid-August, the entire <b>metalimnion</b> becomes completely anoxic, To better understand and to quantify the processes that contribute to the DO dynamics in the lake, temperature, DO, Secchi depth, photosynthetically active radiation (P AR), total suspended solids (TSS), total organic carbon (TOC), total respiration rate and chl-a concentrations were monitored or measured at three locations during the SUlIDner of 1999. The Secchi depth varied from 5 to 10 ft (1. 5 to 3. 0 m) in the deep subbasin and from 2. 5 to 9 ft (0. 75 to 2. 7 m) in the easte 11 l shallow subbasin. The PAR measurements showed ail attenuation coefficient of about 0. 25 ft-I in the deep subbasin; it varied with depth by two orders of magnitude (from 0. 2 ft-) to 25 fr]) in the shallow subbasins, indicating increasing macrophyte density with depth. In the deep subbasin, the TSS concentration varied from 1 to 3 mgll with a maximum of 5 mgll in the upper stratum of the <b>metalimnion.</b> About 76 % of the TSS were volatile, which indicates that most if not all TSS is organic material. Carbonaceous biological oxygen demand (CBOD) was estimated using the TOC profiles.

40|$|In {{late summer}} and autumn, before the {{vertical}} circulation reaches the thermocline, the phytoplankton population of Lake Zurich {{is dominated by the}} red-coloured filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens. which stratifies in the <b>metalimnion</b> at depths close to the photosynthetic compensation point. The filament volume concentration reached a maximum of 12 cm(3) m(- 3); the depth of the maximum varied from 10. 5 to 12. 5 m. Changes in the depth distribution were attributed to a combination of (1) seiche movements, which raised or lowered the thermocline by up to 2 m over 36 h, and (2) flotation by the buoyant filaments relative to the isotherms, by up 0. 4 m d(- 1). These changes caused a 2 -fold change in insolation at the Planktothrix peak. Estimates were made of the daily integral of photosynthetic O- 2 -production, Sigma Sigma (NP), by the population of P. rubescens over a period of four cloudless days. The estimates were calculated from measurements of surface irradiance (at 5 -min intervals), vertical light attenuation, temperature, filament volume concentration and the photosynthesis/irradiance (P/I) curves of filaments concentrated from the <b>metalimnion.</b> Despite the similar, high insolation on each of the four days, the calculated values of Sigma Sigma (NP) varied from 9 to 53 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1), owing to the changing depth distribution of the filaments. Measurements of P/I curves of lakewater samples incubated at a depth of 11 m showed changes in the photosynthetic coefficients during the day. These also generated large changes in calculated values of Sigma Sigma (NP). The computer spreadsheet used to calculate Sigma Sigma (NP) was modified to incorporate time-based changes in the photosynthetic coefficients and vertical distribution of the organism. These refinements provide a more accurate description of photosynthesis by the deep-living P. rubescens, which adjusts its position by buoyancy regulation to exploit the light field in the <b>metalimnion,</b> where it outcompetes other phytoplankton.

40|$|We studied {{over two}} weeks {{the decay of}} a {{population}} of Daphnia pulex that had invaded the previously cladoceran-free epilimnion of Lake Ciso. The cladoceran was found at concentrations up to 1, 900 ind l- 1 in the oxygenated epilimnion of the lake {{while most of the}} available food was concentrated in the <b>metalimnion.</b> D. pulex was never found in the hypolimnion with sulfide concentrations up to 1. 2 mM. Probably due to the food distribution, D. pulex was forced to move into the anoxic lower part of the <b>metalimnion.</b> The animals spent most of the day at the surface, and descended especially at dawn to the upper level of the sulfide distribution. Mainly animals of sizes between 1. 3 and 1. 9 mm migrated. This pattern of population movement was related only to the food distribution and the oxygen profiles, and not to other factors commonly implicated in zooplankton vertical migrations (fish predation was absent). There was strong variability in the horizontal distribution of the animals that we associated to swarming behavior. During our study the population was in decline as shown by the lower indices of fertility and the higher mean sizes of the animals in the later weeks of sampling as compared to the first wee...|$|E

40|$|Zooplankton is {{studied in}} the ancient, tectonic, oligomictic and {{oligotrophic}} Lake Ohrid (Macedonia, South Eastern Europe). The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the seasonal and spatial patterns of the zooplankton functional feeding guilds in relation to the environmental conditions. <b>Metalimnion</b> of the lake was detected as the most productive environment, where biomass of the phytoplankton and abundance of the zooplankton reached their maxima. Pelagial zooplankton of low abundance (25 ± 22 ind. L− 1) consisted of 16 species including two endemic copepods, Arctodiaptomus steindachneri (Richard, 1897) and Cyclops ochridanus (Kiefer, 1932). Copepods obtained remarkable share (60 %) in the zooplankton assemblage. Microphagous zooplankton was mainly comprised of the most abundant rotifer Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott, 1879) in summer, and copepod nauplii during the spring Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars, 1862) and C. ochridanus, and autumn C. ochridanus. Due to their requirements for the bacterio-detritus suspension, this microphagous zooplankton occupied aphotic hypolimnion during the entire study period. Raptorials were typically represented by copepodites and adult copepods in the <b>metalimnion,</b> and were significantly and positively affected by temperature (r = 0. 417, p = 0. 001), dissolved oxygen (r = 0. 463, p = 0. 0001) and, particularly, phytoplankton biomass (r = 0. 708, p < 0. 00001).

40|$|The spatiotemporal {{chemical}} {{characteristics of the}} water column in Linsley Pond, a freshwater lake in Connecticut, were studied from just before its stratification in April through the fall turnover in December. Two low-molecular-weight thiols, glutathione and 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), were detected at nanomolar concentrations in the water column. GSH was detected (average concentrations were ca. 5 nmol L 21 in the particulate phase and ca. 3 nmol L 21 in the dissolved phase) in surface and near-surface waters only and covaried with chlorophyll a. Both particulate and dissolved MPA were measured in the oxic and anoxic regions. In the <b>metalimnion,</b> MPA concentrations were greater than in the oxic water layers above. At times, the MPA concentrations in the <b>metalimnion</b> were as high as {{those found in the}} anoxic hypolimnion. The MPA present at different depths in the Linsley Pond water column is most likely produced through dissimilar mechanisms. Throughout the water column, MPA may be a product of the metabolic degradation of sulfur-containing organic compounds; however, in the hypolimnetic waters, dissolved sulfide may {{play an important role in}} MPA formation through abiotic nucleophillic addition to unsaturated functionalities in dissolved organic matter. Parallel laboratory experiments were performed to assess the importance of MPA in copper speciation. The results confirmed that despite nanomolar levels in Linsley Pond, MPA does not play an important role in coppe...|$|E
40|$|Resources {{in lakes}} are {{vertically}} partitioned due to stratification and trophic interactions. Metalimnetic phytoplankton {{could be an}} important resource for zooplankton that either reside in the <b>metalimnion</b> or migrate through this layer. However, {{it is difficult to}} estimate metalimnetic resource use, especially using isotope approaches, because surface and deep phytoplankton often have similar isotopic compositions. To overcome this limitation, we experimentally enriched the metalimnetic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 13 C pool in Peter Lake to enhance the isotopic separation between metalimnetic phytoplankton and other resources. Metalimnetic d 13 C-DIC peaked at 73. 2 % after the isotope addition and maintained an average enrichment of 34. 5 % above epilimnetic d 13 C-DIC for 62 d. Combining hydrogen and carbon stable isotope values, we estimated the epilimnetic, metalimnetic, and terrestrial resource use by zooplankton, using a Bayesian mixing model that accounted for uncertainties in both consumers and sources. We also measured diel vertical migration and net ecosystem production with in situ bottle incubations {{over the course of the}} experiment. Metalimnetic resource use was minor (0 – 8 %) for zooplankton that either resided in the epilimnion of the lake during the day or migrated there at night. For consumers that resided in the <b>metalimnion,</b> metalimnetic phytoplankton accounted for 18 – 21 % of zooplankton isotope composition.

40|$|An {{intensive}} 5 wk {{study was}} conducted to investigate the role of protists, especially heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), in microbial food webs during the summer phytoplankton bloom in the epilimnion and <b>metalimnion</b> of the eutrophic Rimov reservoir (South Bohemia, Czech Republic). On average, protists consumed similar to 90 % of bacterial production in both layers. The community composition of HNF and the relative importance of different HNF groups as picoplankton consumers were determined. Small HNF (< 8 mu m), as chrysomonads, bodonids and choanoflagellates, usually accounted for < 30 % of total HNF biomass but numerically dominated the community in both layers. They consumed most of (similar to 70 to 85 %) the bacterioplankton as well as autotrophic picoplankton (APP, exclusively cyanobacteria) production in the reservoir, with the rest consumed by ciliates. Both ciliates and HNF had higher clearance rates on APP than on bacteria and their grazing was likely responsible for a sharp decrease in APP abundance (from 3 - 4 x 10 (5) to < 2 x 10 (3) ml(- 1)) and a very constant size structure of bacterioplankton in which short rods in the size class of 0. 4 to 0. 8 mu m constituted 55 to 80 % of the total bacterial biomass in both layers. The proportion of HNF to total picoplankton biomass in the epilimnion indicated that the picoplankton biomass was sufficiently high to support HNF growth for most of the study. Uptake of picoplankton by less numerous, but larger, HNF (kathablepharids, Goniomonas sp., and Streptomonas sp.) was negligible, while their biomass, especially in the <b>metalimnion,</b> exceeded that of small HNF and the total biomass of picoplankton. This suggested that food items other than picoplankton were consumed to meet their carbon requirements. Analyzing potential bottom-up and top-down factors controlling HNF numbers and biomass, we did not find a tight relationship between HNF and the concentration of bacteria and chlorophyll. Variability of HNF abundance and biomass in the epilimnion could largely be explained by cladocerans or by pooled abundances of all potential crustacean consumers of HNF. In the <b>metalimnion,</b> the mean cell volume of HNF was positively linked to chlorophyll but negatively to the abundance of Cyclopidae and to the pooled abundances of Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and Diaphanosoma brachyurum...|$|E
