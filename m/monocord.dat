Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon <b>monocord</b> thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|E
40|$|The MIRAG (Musically Intelligent Robotic Algorithmic Guitar) is a “musically {{autonomous}} ” robot encompassing {{an eclectic}} variety of disciplines including: 17 th century counterpoint, Brazilian folk guitar, algorithmic music composition, proximal human-robot interactivity, and color tracking. Inspired by Pat Metheney’s guitarbot built for his Orchestration project, the MIRAG consists of 3 <b>monocords</b> (platforms on which individual strings and actuators are mounted) that play note events. These note events are {{generated by a}} central brain processor using rules of 17 th century counterpoint (step-by-step rules that determine how to construct music notefor-note that composers like J. S. Bach would have been familiar with). The “brain ” microprocessor takes in environmental data like human proximity, ambient light, {{and the color of}} the human observer’s shirt (red, green, or blue) to influence musical parameters as it composes a musical improvisation in real-time and sends note event commands to “reflex ” microprocessors that drive the actuators and strings...|$|R
