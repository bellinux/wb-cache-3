5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E

By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E

5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
25|$|This ambivalence is {{expressed}} {{also in the}} Greeks' association of the god with the Thracians, whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people.

25|$|But Leaf by Niggle {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as an illustration of Tolkien's religious philosophy of creation and sub-creation. In this philosophy, true creation is <b>the</b> exclusive province <b>of</b> God, and those who aspire to creation can only make echoes (good) or <b>mockeries</b> (evil) <b>of</b> truth. <b>The</b> sub-creation <b>of</b> works that echo <b>the</b> true creations <b>of</b> God is one way that mortals honour God.|$|R

25|$|This {{philosophy}} {{is evident in}} Tolkien's other works, especially The Silmarillion – one Vala, Morgoth, creates the Orc race as a foul <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elf.

25|$|The diabolist {{elements}} of the initiation ceremonies of both the Millers' Word and Horseman's Word {{might have been a}} deliberate parody of Presbyterianism, a form of Protestant Christianity that was then dominant in much of Scotland. Similarly, its embrace of drunkenness, jokes, songs, and toasts may have served as a deliberate <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's conventional morality. The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that these diabolical elements may have derived in part from folk stories of the witches' sabbath, which could have been absorbed either directly from Scottish folklore or from published accounts discussing witchcraft.|$|E
25|$|Such {{details are}} corroborated by many other sources.

Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.|$|E
25|$|Fielding {{hoped to}} remove any moral {{ambiguity}} found within The Beggar's Opera. Unlike The Welsh Opera, the rewrite deals with morality at the very beginning. Similarly, the play focuses on problems within the literary community; the title links the play with the Grub Street Journal, a periodical that satirised inept writers that frequent Grub Street. It also links the play with Fielding's previous attacks on the London theatre and inept writers. In particular, Fielding satirises bad imitations of Gay's The Beggar's Opera {{and those who do}} not understand what Gay's play was originally about especially in regards to its <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian opera tradition.|$|E
40|$|A Dangerous Game of Friedrich Dürrenmatt centres on <b>the</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> justice. <b>The</b> {{issue was}} brought to the big screen for the first time by Ettore Scola’s The Most Wonderful Evening of My Life (1972). There is a {{willingness}} to overcome the narrative and environmental mockery with parodic elements that are closely related to Sordi’s mask. Indeed, despite the Roman actor’s efforts, a scrupulous direction and Sergio Amidei’s accurate screenplay, Sordi’s topical characteristics comes out during his performance. Sordi’s personal comedy clichés overlap the Swiss playwright’s sarcasm with some hyper-parodic aspects. Scola’s movie sets up itself as <b>the</b> "focal point" <b>of</b> an artistic and semantic perspective that begins with Thrilling third episode directed by Carlo Lizzani in 1965 up until Comencini’s Traffic Jam, inspired by Cortazar and having, of course, Alberto Sordi in the leading role. Dürrenmatt’s A Dangerous Game finds in Lizzani’s episode a precursor of some distortions of "judgment" and "condemns ", which will culminate in Comencini's film where a whole path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway will be shut off...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that postmodern epistemology, in its 21 st century guise, is exhausted, with little to offer post-Baudrillard. In {{thematic}} conjunction with <b>the</b> critiques <b>of</b> Fredric Jameson, Christopher Norris and Jürgen Habermas, the author depicts 21 st century postmodernism as a “frenzied party”, where philosophy’s historical and characteristic ardour for truth and analysis has been dissolved in favour <b>of</b> a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most profound ideas of Western civilization, such as truth, beauty and justice. <b>The</b> logical consequences <b>of</b> this frenzied epistemology are described as socially devastating, especially within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> systematic terror, which is described as the predominant social marker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21 st century. The author, in reaction both to terror and “epistemological frenzy”, attempts to rehabilitate philosophical ardour and a zeal for truth by linking up with <b>the</b> historical persona <b>of</b> “the monk”, arguing that our times demand a more studied, retracted and meditative approach to philosophy. Our dreadful times demand a new ardour and sobriety from philosophers.

50|$|Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive {{season that}} occurs before <b>the</b> liturgical season <b>of</b> Lent. <b>The</b> main events {{typically}} occur during February or early March, {{during the period}} historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience {{a heightened sense of}} social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> authorities; <b>the</b> grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.|$|R

Later, the Commissioner approved a trade of relief pitcher Doug Bair to the Reds in a deal that resembled a true trade.

The courts of first instance and appeal decided that they didn't constituted an incitement to hatred towards the Catholics.

In the next match against the West Indies he again opened the bowling and batting, taking 2–29 from 4 overs (the wickets of Chris Gayle & Kieron Pollard). He then scored 41 not out from 24 balls to win the Man of the Match award as his side won by 17 runs (by the Duckworth-Lewis method). Against India, he was used as second change bowler and took 3–34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of Yuvraj Singh and opener Irfan Pathan in the 11th over. He also dismissed Suresh Raina in the last over. He followed it up with 72 from 42 balls (7 sixes and 2 fours) making a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target 141. Against South Africa he took 2–29 (the wickets of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers), following it up with 70 from 47 balls to win his fourth consecutive Man of the Match award.
