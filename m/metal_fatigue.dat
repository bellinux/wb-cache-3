5|$|Recent use of {{high-tensile steel}} allows {{building}} a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength. However, {{because it is}} thinner than regular steel, HT steel can corrode more easily, plus it can develop <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> in choppy seas.|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue.</b>|$|E

Although Australia originally planned to buy the American F-111A design, RAAF liaison officers requested country-specific changes such as a long-distance radio, Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> expertise, and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions.

50|$|Fatigue {{failures}} of nitinol devices are a constant subject of discussion. Because {{it is the}} material of choice for applications requiring enormous flexibility and motion (e.g., peripheral stents, heart valves, smart thermomechanical actuators and electromechanical microactuators), it is necessarily exposed to much greater fatigue strains compared to other metals. While the strain-controlled fatigue performance of nitinol is superior to all other known <b>metals,</b> <b>fatigue</b> failures have been observed in the most demanding applications.

In this research the distribution of defects in a ferritic {{spheroidal graphite cast iron}} component was determined. Then, Gumbel distribution was used to estimate the maximum sizes of defects in cylindrical fatigue specimens with different dimensions. Based on estimated maximum defect size, the fracture mechanics approach was used to determine the lower bound of the fatigue life for fatigue specimens with different dimensions and the geometrical size effect was modeled...|$|R
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue,</b> a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators.

5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCyclic nanoindentation loading is a {{localized}} {{fatigue test}} providing very useful informations on dynamic damage phenomena of nanostructured materials. The main {{goal of the}} present paper is to examine ultra-fine and nanocrystalline <b>metals</b> <b>fatigue</b> through cyclic nanoindentation experiments. In the present study berkovitch indentations were performed in order to evaluate monotonic indentation stress–strain curves and cyclic indentation stress–number of cycles diagrams. Multi-step indentation allows for a rapid evaluation of variation of mechanical properties with increasing depth and in combination with single-step indentation response, is indicative of deformation induced structural changes in the material. In addition, it is put in evidence the depth propagation behavior under cyclic loading simulating a fatigue crack propagation. Such technique is very attractive {{for the evaluation of}} fracture toughness...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{fatigue crack}} {{initiation}} phenomenon in metals is essentially associated to the gliding of dislocations {{and the creation}} of slip bands which characterize irreversible damaging mechanisms at the grains scale. A multiscale approach is then interesting to establish a link between the scale of the structure submitted to cyclic loading and the scale of damage. Some stress based criteria were previously proposed in this framework based on the shakedown theories, as Dang Van or Papadopoulos ones. The same approach is developed in this paper in the usual Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (TIP) framework in order to study the link between dissipation, shakedown and fatigue damage. Some recent results in <b>metals</b> <b>fatigue</b> coming from infrared thermography experiments are then interpreted through the TIP; the proposed framework seems to be particularly relevant to define a more general feature {{for the study of the}} fatigue phenomenon...|$|R
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> as a contributory cause.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of cast <b>metals,</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{strength}} assessment necessarily deals with the strength reduction caused by randomly distributed small-sized defects. When components are taken into account, stress raisers due to component geometry are possible crack initiation sites as well as defects. For {{the investigation of the}} overall performance, an appropriate model considering notch sensitivity of parent material and defect behavior shall be used. Unfortunately, several mechanical models of material sensitivity to notches and defects require the knowledge of the un-defected material strength, which is not obtainable in this case. In this contribution, experimental fatigue tests have been carried out on plane and notched specimens, considering small size notches as well. An appropriate analysis of the generated results allowed the evaluation of the material behavior and its notch sensitivity according to critical distances theories. The obtained results have been confirmed also direct inspection of broken samples...|$|R

40|$|Anticipating and {{characterizing the}} damage induced by fatigue {{loadings}} is a challenging {{problem in the}} composites science and tech-nology. In contrast to <b>metals,</b> <b>fatigue</b> degradation of composites is presented since {{the initial stages of}} the process leading to a decrease in the mechanical performance. The literature covers a large num-ber of fatigue models for composites, the majority of them are only valid in their experimental conditions. In this thesis a novel bayesian inverse strategy to reconstruct fatigue damage over lifetime is pro-posed. This model has been developed to be extensible to different material configurations and loading conditions, in a coherent sta-tistical sense. Finally this result has led to a bayesian model class selection, by which it is possible to select the most plausible model parameterization. The proposed methodology has been validated against fatigue damage data. This bayesian framework has shown versatility to take into account all possible information about data, models and the relation between them. The updated information inserted into the reliability problem is shown to confer a way to con-sidered the long term reliability without the need to make hypothesis for time to failure. RESUME...|$|R
5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue.</b> While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by <b>metal</b> <b>fatigue</b> that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the high-pressure compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to observe fatigue failure using a rotating fatigue (Wohler) machine which applied a cyclical stress to samples of 6061 -T 6 aluminum with a neck radius of 2. 50 mm. For non-ferrous <b>metals,</b> <b>fatigue</b> results in the deterioration of a material after a prolonged stress {{has been applied to}} it and the number of cycles to failure depends on the stresses applied. Several samples of the 6061 -T 6 material were loaded with stresses ranging from 0. 9 to 0. 6 of the yield strength. The resulting numbers of cycles to failure were statistically analyzed using Chauvenet’s criterion and plotted as a stress vs. cycles (S-N) diagram. An estimated endurance limit of 85 MPa was extrapolated from a curve fit, based on a number of cycles to failure of 5 x 108. Finally, a comparison was made to the known endurance limit and comparisons were made to number of cycles to failure (N) based on errors in the measured neck radius of the test specimen. The large change in N with small changes in neck radius indicates a high degree of uncertainty for the data determined in this experiment...|$|R
