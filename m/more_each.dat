5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or <b>more.</b> <b>Each</b> of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways.

The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E

25|$|The Economy SkyCouch is {{available}} on the 787-9, 777-200ER and 777-300ER. It is a set of three Economy class seats on the window rows of the cabin that have armrests that retract into the seat back, and full leg rests that individually and manually can be raised to horizontal to form a flat surface extending {{to the back of the}} seats in front. It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the middle seat for 25% <b>more</b> <b>each,</b> can use it as a flat sleeping surface. Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same basic facilities as a standard Pacific Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the leg rests are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Browns {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar in the supplemental draft. As a rookie, Kosar {{learned through}} trial by fire {{as he took}} over for Gary Danielson midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit <b>more</b> <b>each</b> Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the ten games Kosar started. Two young rushers, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, played a large part in the team's success, as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards. The Browns' 8–8 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, and they looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoff game with a 21–3 lead at halftime. It took Dan Marino's spirited second-half comeback {{to win the game}} for Miami 24–21. While the Browns' faithful may have felt the initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC championship game in three of those years.|$|E

He first sacked Beroea and then Antioch (allowing the garrison of 6,000 men to leave the city), besieged Daras, and then went on to attack the small but strategically significant satellite kingdom of Lazica near the Black Sea, exacting tribute from the towns he passed along his way.

[...] In Game 1 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers, Molina threw out Ian Kinsler attempting to steal in the first inning {{on the way to a}} 3–2 win. [...] It was the Rangers' only attempted steal of the game. [...] That caught stealing gave Molina five in seven total chances in the 2011 postseason to that point; the Rangers had been tied with the Cardinals for most steals in that postseason. [...] For the series, the Rangers attempted to steal four bases and were successful just once. [...] In Game 3, Molina accumulated four RBI, and two <b>more</b> <b>each</b> in Games 6 and 7.|$|E
500|$|Kosar, {{who wanted}} to play for Cleveland because his family lived {{in a suburb of}} nearby Youngstown, Ohio, signed a five-year {{contract}} worth nearly $6 million in 1985 and was immediately embraced by the Browns organization and the team's fans. [...] "It's not an everyday occurrence that somebody wants to play in Cleveland", Modell said. [...] "This has lent such an aura to Bernie." [...] Kosar saw his first action in the fifth week of the 1985 season against the New England Patriots, when he substituted before halftime for Gary Danielson, a 34-year-old veteran who the Browns had acquired in the offseason from the Lions. Kosar fumbled his first-ever NFL snap, but rebounded and led the team to a 24–20 win. A mix of success and failure followed, but Kosar progressed a bit <b>more</b> <b>each</b> Sunday and led the team to an 8–8 record. Two young running backs, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, complemented Kosar's aerial attack with more than 1,000yards rushing each.|$|E
