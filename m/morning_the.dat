50|$|The {{problem of}} co-referring {{expressions}} originated primarily with Gottlob Frege {{as the problem}} of informative identities.

This is apparently problematic because although the two expressions seem to denote the same thing, one cannot substitute one for the other, which one {{ought to be able to}} do with identical or synonymous expressions.|$|R

It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
