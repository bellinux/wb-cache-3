5|$|The Kolkata Municipal Corporation {{supplies}} {{the city with}} potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
5|$|The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{is an area}} of European {{importance}} for wildlife in Norfolk, England. It comprises 7,700ha (19,027acres) of the county's north coast from just west of Holme-next-the-Sea to Kelling, and is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) listings; it is also part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the topography of the watershed consists of rolling land that is densely settled. A large undeveloped tract of land owned by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority is located {{at the mouth of the}} creek.|$|E

25|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} Iran's {{total surface area}} is suited for farmland, but because of poor soil and lack of {{adequate}} water distribution in many areas, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not under cultivation.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Cheddar {{cheese in}} New Zealand is factory produced. While <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sold young within the country, the Anchor dairy company ships New Zealand Cheddars to the UK, where the blocks mature {{for another year}} or so.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the town is the line of Stane Street, an old Roman road. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now built over or is used as {{woodland}} and hillside footpaths. The road leads from London to Chichester, passing through the strategic Mole Gap.|$|E
25|$|Luzzatto {{also wrote}} poetry and drama. Although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{seemingly}} secular, some scholars {{claim to have}} identified mystical undertones in this body of work as well. His writing is strongly influenced by the Jewish poets of Spain and by contemporary Italian authors.|$|E

25|$|On January 5, 2006, Roe Conn {{mentioned}} Wikipedia in {{his daily}} talk show on WLS. He {{said that while}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> factually correct, some details (including his birthday) were incorrect. Now his birthday is correct on the site (as of June 7, 2006). However, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed, whom Roe loves to read, declared his birthday as June 7 in her June 7, 2006, column.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} organic acidemias, GA1 causes {{carnitine}} depletion. Whole-blood carnitine {{can be raised}} by oral supplementation. However, this does not significantly change blood concentrations of glutarylcarnitine or esterified carnitine, suggesting that oral supplementation is suboptimal in raising tissue levels of carnitine. In the field of clinical nutrition, researchers {{come to the same}} conclusion, that oral carnitine raises plasma levels but doesn't affect muscle carnitine, where <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> stored and used.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Aylesworth Creek (a total of 89 percent) is on forested land. The remaining 11 percent includes abandoned mine lands, residential development, and recreational development. The watershed is considerably narrower in its lower reaches than in its upper reaches. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in Archbald, Carbondale Township, and Jefferson Township. A smaller part of {{the watershed}} is in Mayfield. However, the easternmost corner is in Wayne County.|$|E

25|$|Far {{ultraviolet}} light is absorbed effectively by the neutral {{components of the}} ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, {{it is nearly impossible}} to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|The series utilises {{time-lapse}} sequences {{extensively in}} order to grant insights {{that would otherwise be}} almost impossible. Plants live on a different time scale, and even though their life is highly complex and often surprising, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> invisible to humans unless events that happen over months or even years are shown within seconds. Like many traditional wildlife documentaries, it makes use of almost no computer animation. The series also discusses fungi, although as it is pointed out, these do not belong to the kingdom of plants.|$|E
25|$|Many of high peaks {{between the}} borough and the State of Mexico {{are used as}} lookouts for {{criminal}} organizations. Because of this, the borough ranks ninth in criminal activity. The largest problem is illegal settlements. An estimated 191 forested and other areas have {{been taken over by}} about 8,000 families. Some of these communities are over twenty years old. Although some of the illegal construction represents individuals trying to claim a large tract, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> shantytowns for the poor with few or no services.|$|E
50|$|Diario is {{the third}} studio album by the Puerto Rican reggae band, Cultura Prof√©tica.

50|$|Before {{the mosque}} was built, Muslims would gather {{at a house}} {{that used to be}} on the property. In 1975 the {{building}} began and was completed the following year in 1976.

50|$|Cher {{is one of}} the {{original}} 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created, along with the adjacent department of Indre from the former province of Berry.

25|$|The A52 Brian Clough Way {{was built}} upon the canal between the Pentagon and Spondon. From Spondon the {{line can be}} traced to Sandiacre. NCN 6 uses the canal route between Borrowash and Breaston. One of the few {{original}} bridges is situated between the A6005 Derby Road and the railway at Borrowash. It is constructed of red brick with stone dressings, and is grade II listed. The lock-keepers cottage at Sandiacre Lock also dates from {{around the time of the}} opening of the canal, and although it has additional windows added in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> original.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} of Hicks Creek is forested land, which makes up 57.0 {{percent of the total}} land area. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{in the northern part of}} the watershed. The second-largest land use is residential land, which makes up 19.6 percent of the total land area. 6.7 percent each is devoted to open space and meadows, while 5.5 percent is commercial land. A total of 2.2 percent is abandoned mining land, 1.8 percent is agricultural land, and 0.5 percent is water. Several residential areas, such as Ida Acres, Schooley Village, and Wildflower Village, have been developed since the early 2000s in the watershed.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the town}} has been excavated, {{revealing}} Jewish homes along a main cobblestone street. Several images have been found carved into the stones of the street, including that of a menorah, and another image that resembles some ancient game reminiscent of tic-tac-toe. Mikva'ot, Jewish ritual baths, identified by carved steps leading to a pool, were also discovered. The Roman theater sits on the northern slope of the hill, and is about 45m in diameter, seating 4500. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> carved into the hillside, but some parts are supported by separate stone pillars. The theater shows evidence of ancient damage, possibly from the earthquake in 363.|$|E

5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, and because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus's reign, combined {{with the fact that}} the later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|R
