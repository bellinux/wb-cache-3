It was [...] "an act of betrayal," [...] said Carville. [...] "Mr. Richardson’s endorsement came right around {{the anniversary of the}} day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver, so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic,” <b>Mr.</b> <b>Carville</b> said, referring to Holy Week. Governor Richardson had served in President Bill Clinton's administration as both United States Ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of Energy, and Carville believed that Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton in exchange for being offered those posts by her husband. Carville also claimed that Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides. Richardson denied Carville's account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was [...] "clinched" [...] by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright. Carville went on to note,"I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future," [...] Carville said, but [...] "I've had my say...I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged it." ...|$|E
