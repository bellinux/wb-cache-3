5000|$|The Delta Lines at {{its maximum}} extent would {{accommodate}} {{from six to}} seventeen operators, {{all of whom were}} personal friends with no formal club organization. They met weekly on Saturdays, organized like the operating staff of a real railroad, and boasted attendance averaging 97 per cent.

Electric power was [...] "flat" [...] direct current provided by rechargeable batteries that had been scavenged from retired full size railroad passenger cars. The scenery was also hand-constructed, using methods that were common in museums and theatre stages: many structures painted on flats, instead of modeled, and artificial perspective where needed to create the illusion of distance. Operations used an accelerated clock to increase the apparent lengths of runs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Texas Christian University Press {{began its}} long {{association}} with Smith’s works through {{the publication of}} his short-story collection, Letters From the Horse Latitudes. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, American Literary Review, American Short Fiction, The Missouri Review, and descant. Writing about the collection in The New York Times, Benjamin Cheever said, ”Set in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today <b>most</b> <b>O.</b> Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing." [...]” His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from Quartet; the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from Southwest Review, as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story “The Plantation Club” was included in, “Seeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,” published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, “The Bundelays,” was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts’ “Arts and Letters Live Series,” as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.|$|E
