50|$|During the 8888 Uprising, {{restrictions}} loosened {{and many}} artists began writing music with themes {{of freedom and}} democracy. However, after the State Law and Order Restoration Council usurped power in 1988, the Press Scrutiny Board was reformed to censor specific political and social issues, including poverty, the sex trade, democracy and human rights. The Myanmar Music Asiayon (MMA) was established by the SLORC to further censor Burmese-produced music. Popular musicians including <b>Zaw</b> <b>Win</b> Htut and Sai Htee Saing have produced propaganda albums written by military officers such as Mya Than San.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the reports}} on the crises have been limited outside of the country due to the media blackout, {{by the end of}} February, a Singapore-based {{business}} magazine wrote that they are watching the crises with concern and one firm has already closed down operations in Yangon.

Three month into the banking crises, all three biggest banks were facing severe cash shortages. Yoma bank was reportedly selling its capital assets in order to raise liquidity.|$|R

Two of his students, Min Wae Aung and Zaw Zaw Aung, painted portraits of him. One of these works by Zaw Zaw Aung, an ironic oil painting titled Portrait of U Kyaw Hlaing: Visit Myanmar Year 1996 (1995), was done when Kyaw Hlaing had passed the age of 80.

50|$|In September 2016, the {{commission}} faced sustained criticism and questions regarding conduct of {{the commission}} arises when they brokered the compensation scheme to accept 5 million Kyat, approximately US$4,000, instead of pursuing legal action {{in the case of}} two girls tortured for 5 years as housemaids in Yangon. The Ava Tailor Shop owners reportedly forced the girls, currently 16 and 17 years old, to work without day-off and tortured over the course of 5 years: breaking their fingers and arms, and slicing with knife. On 22 September, MP Pyone Cho from Dawbon Township submitted an urgent proposal to take action against the Commission, and the Pyithu Hluttaw accepted to discuss further.

In August 2013, <b>Win</b> <b>Zaw</b> Oo announced his decision to surgically remove the tumour which caused his drastic height of 233 cm.

40|$|AbstractIf x is a vertex {{of a tree}} T of radius r, if k and l are integers, if 0 ⩽ k ⩽ r, 0 ⩽ l ⩽ r, and if P is an l-path {{with one}} end at x, then define β(x; k, P) to be the number of {{vertices}} of T that are reachable from x via the l-path P and that are outside of the k-ball about x. That is, β(x;k,P) = ∣{yϵV(T) :y is reachable from x via P,d(x,y) > k}∣. Define the k-ball l-path branch weight of x, denoted β(x;k,l), to be max {β(x;k,P) :P an l-path with one end at x}, and define the k-balll-path branch weight centroid of T, denoted B(T;k,l), to be the set xϵV(T) : β(x;k,l) ⩽ β(y;k,l), yϵV(T). This two-parameter family of central sets in T includes the one-parameter family of central sets called the k-nuclei introduced by Slater (1981) which {{has been shown to}} be the one parameter family of central sets called the k-branch weight centroids by <b>Zaw</b> <b>Win</b> (1993). It also includes the one-parameter family of central sets called the k-ball branch weight centroid introduced by Reid (1991). In particular, this new family contains the classical central sets, the center and the median (which Zelinka (1968) showed is the ordinary branch weight centroid). The sets obtained for particular values of k and l are examined, and it is shown that for many values they consist of one vertex or two adjacent vertices...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a high throughput microfluidic method to control cell placement in two-dimensional tissue engineering. Other contributors include <b>Zaw</b> <b>Win</b> and Patrick W. Alford (Faculty Mentor). Recent {{studies have shown}} that cell shape and tissue structure can dictate functional behavior in engineered tissues (1). One method for controlling tissue structure in vitro is microcontact printing, where extracellular matrix proteins are patterned on a substrate to construct arrays of single cells or multicellular tissues. This technique is used to create tissues that mimic in vivo architecture which can be used to study tissue properties and disease mechanisms (2). Traditional seeding of cells on the substrate is imprecise, but our group has developed a microfluidic device for spatial control of cell seeding, which creates more replicable high-fidelity tissues. However, the current method is low-throughput and labor intensive. Here, we present a scalable system of multiple microfluidic devices for parallel cell seeding. This high-throughput, precise approach reduces experimental variation, making biochemical assays on single cell arrays possible in future work. We will use this system to create large arrays of single cells of various shapes for phenotypic studies and to create arrays of tissues with varying cellular organization. 1) Alford, P.

50|$|Myanmar law {{enforcement}} reported continued cooperation with Chinese counterparts on cross-border trafficking cases, including joint operations, {{as well as}} general cooperation with Thai authorities.In 2009, the ILO continued to receive and investigate forced labor complaints; 93 cases were submitted to the Myanmar government for action, an increase from 64 cases in 2008; 54 cases remain open and are awaiting a response from the government. Despite a report of a child labor case involving as many as 100 children on an agricultural plantation near Rangoon, the regime did not report any efforts to investigate the allegation. Many minors from Myanmar work in Thai border towns, particularly the town of Mae Sai. Drivers who smuggle illegal workers into Thailand go to villages to recruit minors, and then transport them to the border. In one such case found in a survey, a girl was deceived by a driver, and sold into prostitution.3 Between 20,000 and 30,000 women and girls from Myanmar {{are estimated to be}} working in the prostitution industry in Thailand. As illegal immigrants, they are often arrested and deported back to Myanmar. About 50 to 70 percent of the prostitutes are HIV positive.In other cases, children from Myanmar were tricked during their recruitment, and not paid for the jobs they were promised. It is believed that the children from Myanmar make up the largest sector of foreign working children. Minors also participate in the fishing industry and work in Bangkok, though this isn’t as common. The ethnic minorities from Myanmar working in Thailand were also found to have the lowest education in all minor workers surveyed, at about 1.3 years, and Burmans were found to have only a slightly higher education level, on average roughly four years. The minors from Myanmar that work in Thailand usually left for economic reasons.A lack of job opportunities in Myanmar has contributed to the rise of human trafficking operations, and now the trade is no longer targeting rural areas but is reaching the country’s major cities. Many of the 2.5 million migrants from Myanmar came to Thailand to find low-paying domestic jobs during the militaristic regime previously in place. These migrants often lack basic education and access to social security benefits.Conversations between the US and Myanmar have been more frequent in recent years. The U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons Luis CdeBaca and Myanmar Police Chief Major General <b>Zaw</b> <b>Win</b> agreed in the need for government-civil society partnerships, health care, and prevention. The latest reports from Washington indicate that the US feels improvements are underway.|$|R
