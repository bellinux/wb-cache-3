25|$|In {{the middle}} to late 1970s, some 75 percent of Laredo's streets were still unpaved, and Tatangelo {{challenged}} the established order that permitted a low standard of achievement. Tatangelo said that Cranston, Rhode Island, a city with which he was familiar because his last surviving sibling, Gilda T. Merolla, resides there, had at that time a population {{comparable to that of}} Laredo. Cranston had all paved streets and a $1 million budget. Laredo had a $3 million budget with <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> dirt, dusty roads. Cranston also had to earmark funds for snow and ice clearance, an expense that did not apply to Laredo, with its semiarid climate.|$|E
500|$|Others media {{publications}} {{were more}} critical of the show. Television critic Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Stewart was more [...] "amusing than funny". He added, [...] "Many of his jokes fell flat with {{the stars in the}} Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, [...] "It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by." [...] Moreover, he derided the [...] "piles and piles and <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> clips from films present and past" [...] writing that it [...] "squandered the visual luster" [...] of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, [...] "Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." [...] He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it [...] "distracting and obnoxious." ...|$|E

[...] As the U.S. Armed Forces were preparing for a confrontation with the Taliban in September 2001, Karzai began urging NATO states to purge his country of al-Qaeda.

2500|$|While {{the album}} did not gain much {{attention}} from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited {{as one of the}} most important hardcore punk albums ever released. Rolling Stone in their retrospective review says that [...] "Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on [...] "TV Party" [...] and [...] "Rise Above." [...] Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it." [...] Pitchfork in their retrospective review from 2002 says [...] "Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called 'songs', a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. Damaged hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to 'Rise Above' and try not to be incensed, then listen to 'TV Party' and try not to laugh out loud. That's awesome." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a very high rating of a [...] "A-" [...] and saying [...] "...Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and 'Rise Above', 'Six Pack', and the uproarious 'TV Party' prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments." [...] John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying [...] "...Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer made all the difference. His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire 'TV Party'..." [...] and also noted [...] "...Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record alone would cause the fall of America's youth) to become and remain an important document of its time." ...|$|E

60|$|Forgetting their hunger-bred {{weakness}} in the wild excitement of that moment, Rachel and Richard struggled hand in hand, after Noie's thin, ethereal form. Across the open space they struggled, through the furious bufferings of the gale, sometimes on their feet, sometimes {{on their hands and}} knees, till they came to the great wall where a stairway ran up it to an outlook tower. Up this stair they climbed slowly since at times the weight of the wind pinned them against the blocks of stone, till at length they reached its crest and crept into the shelter of the hollow tower. Hence, looking through the loopholes in the ancient masonry, they saw a fearful sight. The flakes of burning moss from the Tree of the Tribe had fallen among the tops of the forest, parched almost to tinder with drought and heat, and fired them here and there. Fanned by the screaming gale the flames spread rapidly, leaping from tree to tree, now in one direction, now in another, as the hurricane veered, which it did continually, till the whole green forest became a sheet of fire, an ever-widening sheet which spread east and west and north <b>and</b> south for <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> tens <b>of</b> <b>miles.</b>|$|R

40|$|Look as {{carefully}} as you can over this field of desolation and carnage {{and you will find}} hardly an inch of ground that has not been blasted over and over again by explosive shells.

Shell holes without number {{as far as the eye}} can reach, filled with stagnant gas filled water, as deadly as the wells that the Germans poisoned as they retreated. At the edge of the hole nearest to you is discernible a rifle and bayonet; at your feet is a helmet still covering the head of its owner. Farther on toward the largest tree stump you can see the body of one of the dead. Hundreds like this soldier have lain between the lines of the armies, for days, weeks, months, when the fighting, fiercer than ever before raged all about them. On the extreme right there are the remains of another of the men who strove in the dusk of some gray morning to make his way to the enemy’s lines.
