5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha likely {{emerged as}} a deity {{as early as the}} 2nd century AD, but <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, {{although}} he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

25|$|On May 9, 2013, Crist {{announced}} that he supports same-sex marriage; “I <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> support marriage equality in Florida {{and look forward to}} the day it happens here.” In both 2006 and 2008, Crist announced his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment although by 2010, he had endorsed adoption rights for gay couples.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days before}} the premiere, the Venetian daily, the Gazzetta privilegiata di Venezia, had {{published}} a letter purportedly written to its editor by 'A.B.' of Fonzaso, in Weinstein's view <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> fabricated by Tommaso Locatelli, the musically sophisticated man who edited the paper. In the letter, he complained about the delay {{in the production of}} Beatrice {{as the end of the}} season became closer.|$|E
25|$|The bird's local {{conservation}} status {{varies depending on}} the level of disturbance in the forest. Generally speaking it is locally fairly common in Northeastern India, frequent in Bhutan, and locally dispersed in Bangladesh. The forests of Vietnam appear to be a stronghold, for the birds are reported regularly from many localities throughout the country. Elsewhere throughout its range, it is uncommon to scarce, including Nepal where habitat destruction <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> explains a rapid decline in population numbers in that area.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} authors in Old Church Slavonic {{after the death}} of Methodius and the dissolution of the Great Moravian academy were Clement of Ohrid (active also in Great Moravia), Constantine of Preslav, Chernorizetz Hrabar and John Exarch, all of whom worked in medieval Bulgaria {{at the end of the}} 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. The Second Book of Enoch was only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> had been Greek or even Hebrew or Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|Their pottery was distinctive. The {{spread of}} their pottery along trade routes into {{surrounding}} cultures {{was much more}} impressive than any of their achievements domestically. It was painted black and red, using geometric designs. Examples have been found {{as far south as}} Syria and Israel, and as far north as Dagestan and Chechnya. The spread of this pottery, along with archaeological evidence of invasions, suggests that the Kura-Araxes people may have spread outward from their original homes and, <b>most</b> <b>certainly,</b> had extensive trade contacts. Jaimoukha believes that its southern expanse is attributable primarily to Mitanni and the Hurrians.|$|E
25|$|Höðr returns home, recounts to King Gevar that he {{had lost}} his path and been tricked by the forest maidens, and {{immediately}} asks King Gevar for his daughter Nanna's hand in wedlock. Gevar tells Höðr that he would <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> approve of the marriage, but that Baldr has already requested Nanna's hand. Gevar says that he fears Baldr's wrath, for Baldr's body is infused with a holy strength and cannot be harmed by steel. Gevar is, however, aware of a sword that will kill Baldr, and he explains that it is very well protected, and tells him how to retrieve the sword.|$|E

25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she did when she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> a bookseller {{due to the fact that}} there were a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
25|$|Somehow {{influenced}} by the scientific theories of 19th century, but <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> {{by the idea of}} human progress, Victor Hugo wrote in The Legend of the Centuries (1859) a long poem in two parts that can be viewed like a dystopia/utopia fiction, called 20th century. It shows in a first scene the body of a broken huge ship, the greatest product of the prideful and foolish mankind that called it Leviathan, wandering in a desert world where the winds blow and the anger of the wounded Nature is; humanity, finally reunited and pacified, has gone toward the stars in a starship, to look for and to bring liberty into the light.|$|E

25|$|In 1650 Dryden {{went up to}} Trinity College, Cambridge. Here {{he would}} have {{experienced}} {{a return to the}} religious and political ethos of his childhood: the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of Thomas Hill who had been a rector in Dryden's home village. Though there is little specific information on Dryden's undergraduate years, he would <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> have followed the standard curriculum of classics, rhetoric, and mathematics. In 1654 he obtained his BA, graduating top of the list for Trinity that year. In June of the same year Dryden's father died, leaving him some land which generated a little income, but not enough to live on.|$|E
25|$|Environmentalists such as American John Muir {{were the}} chief agents of {{bringing}} environmental concerns {{to the attention}} of the public, whereupon they became political concerns; such leaders were not given a voice in the USSR, they did not step forward, or they did not exist. <b>Most</b> <b>certainly</b> they did not exist in 1867, when Muir first began distributing his writing in the US. His efforts to promote environmentalism began 50 years before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution in late 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War (1918–21), known collectively as the Russian Revolution. The Soviet Union had not begun to exist until then.|$|E
25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} that Kelvin had <b>most</b> <b>certainly</b> died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, probably {{caused by the}} insertion of a blunt object, such as a beer bottle, {{and that he had}} suffered bruising and injuries to his head and back, which were likely to have been caused by blows. Analysis of Kelvin's bloodstream revealed traces of four hypnotic drugs, including Mandrax and Noctec. With the drugs as their only firm lead at that stage, police began sifting through prescriptions for those drugs. During their search they found a prescription for Mandrax issued to a B. von Einem, a name familiar to police as he had been questioned previously over the deaths of three young men and the alleged sexual assault of another.|$|E
