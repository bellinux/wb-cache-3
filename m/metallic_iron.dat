5|$|About 1 in 20 meteorites {{consist of}} the unique iron-nickel {{minerals}} taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites are the main form of natural <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> on the Earth's surface. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200kg per capita. Much of this is in more-developed countries (7000–14000kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|The {{average density}} of Callisto, 1.83g/cm3, {{suggests}} a composition of approximately equal parts of rocky material and water ice, with some additional volatile ices such as ammonia. The mass fraction of ices is 49–55%. The exact composition of Callisto's rock component is not known, but is probably {{close to the}} composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 0.9–1.3 in Callisto, whereas the solar ratio is around 1:8.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of granular iron PRB technology was reliant on two advances: that <b>metallic</b> <b>irons</b> breaks down chlorinated organic compounds, and that reactions can proceed in situ under normal groundwater conditions. Metals {{have been used}} as catalysts since the 20th century, with more literature available concerning the corrosion of metal shipping and storage containers. Because this literature concerned pure solvents rather than aqueous solutions and the processes often occurred at high temperatures and pressures, it was not looked at by the environmental community. In 1972, zerovalent metals were found to be effective in breaking down pesticides and other chlorinated organic compounds in aqueous solution. However, this finding was also overlooked, perhaps because it was only recorded in patents and it preceded awareness of chlorinated solvents in groundwater as an environmental problem.|$|R
5|$|The {{average density}} of Ganymede, 1.936 g/cm3, {{suggests}} a composition of about equal parts rocky material and mostly water-ices. The mass fraction of ices is between 46–50 %, which is {{slightly lower than}} that in Callisto. Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present. The exact composition of Ganymede's rock is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon ranges between 1.05 and 1.27 in Ganymede, whereas the solar ratio is around 1.8.|$|E
25|$|Also like Earth, Mars is a {{differentiated}} planet, {{meaning that}} it has a central core made up of <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> and nickel surrounded by a less dense, silicate mantle and crust. The planet's distinctive red colour is due to the oxidation of iron on its surface.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amide, {{commonly}} called sodamide, is the inorganic compound with the formula NaNH2. This solid, which is dangerously reactive toward water, is white, but commercial samples are typically gray {{due to the}} presence of small quantities of <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> from the manufacturing process. Such impurities do not usually affect the utility of the reagent. NaNH2 conducts electricity in the fused state, its conductance being similar to that of NaOH in a similar state. NaNH2 has been widely employed as a strong base in organic synthesis.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} isomer {{shift and}} quadrupole splitting are generally evaluated {{with respect to}} a reference material. For example, in iron compounds, the Mössbauer parameters were evaluated using iron foil (thickness less than 40 micrometers). The centroid of the six lines spectrum from <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> foil is −0.1mm/s (for Co/Rh source). All shifts in other iron compounds are computed relative to this −0.10mm/s (at room temperature), i.e., in this case isomer shifts are relative to Co/Rh source. In other words, the centre point of the Mössbauer spectrum is zero. The shift values may also be reported relative to 0.0mm/s, here shifts are relative to the iron foil.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, if {{iron and}} sulfur are heated {{together}} in a certain ratio (1 atom of iron for each atom of sulfur, or by weight, 56 grams (1 mol) of iron to 32grams (1mol) of sulfur), a chemical reaction takes place and a new substance is formed, the compound iron(II) sulfide, with chemical formula FeS. The resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance {{and is not a}} mixture. Iron(II) sulfide has its own distinct properties such as melting point and solubility, and the two elements cannot be separated using normal mechanical processes; a magnet will be unable to recover the iron, since there is no <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> present in the compound.|$|E
25|$|In operation, the {{bloomery}} is preheated {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to <b>metallic</b> <b>iron,</b> without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E

500|$|Cyanide {{complexes}} are technically organometallic {{but more}} important are carbonyl complexes and sandwich and half-sandwich compounds. [...] The premier iron(0) compound is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, {{which is used to}} produce carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of <b>metallic</b> <b>iron.</b> Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl. Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state.

50|$|There {{are many}} other {{manufacturers}} that are used by Petroleum Technicians, but these are few examples of the petroleum equipment manufacturers. The Petroleum Technician and Installer trade consists of electrical and mechanical equipment, so there are many manufacturers that they must use for each specific thing. For example, with the electrical components the equipment must be explosion proof, and with mechanical components one is dealing with multiple types of piping material such as plastic, Sched 40 BP masters <b>metallic,</b> cast <b>iron,</b> and threaded, {{as well as the}} pumping and valve systems.|$|R
5000|$|Micrometeorites are {{typically}} <b>metallic</b> microspherules (<b>iron</b> or iron and nickel) {{but can also}} be formed by silicate minerals, whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial meteoroids, resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the Earth’s atmosphere. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface.

500|$|It is {{estimated}} that Europa has an outer layer of water around [...] thick; a part frozen as its crust, and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice. Recent magnetic-field data from the Galileo orbiter showed that Europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with Jupiter's, which suggests {{the presence of a}} subsurface conductive layer. This layer is likely a salty liquid-water ocean. Portions of the crust are estimated to have undergone a rotation of nearly 80°, nearly flipping over (see true polar wander), which would be unlikely if the ice were solidly attached to the mantle. Europa probably contains a <b>metallic</b> <b>iron</b> core..|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} permanent occupation {{is a series}} of ditches of 11th or 12th century date which are believed to have formed an enclosure, the south east corner of which lies below the [...] "chapel". Evidence for any buildings within the enclosure has either been lost to the Glaven or is buried outside the survey area. Few finds were associated with the ditches, although some fragments of Roman or earlier pottery and three Henry III pennies were found nearby. As elsewhere on the site, there is little evidence to link the old pottery to its location when found. By the time of the construction of the main building, some time in the 14th century, the ditches had filled with sand. A small hearth was built at ground level, shortly before or during the erection of S1. It appears to have had fairly light use, but the presence of slag suggests that it was intended for smelting iron, perhaps by a smith. There was evidence for a number of small fires elsewhere in S1 at a similar date to the hearth, but whether they were related to the smelting is unknown. At this time, hearths could not melt <b>metallic</b> <b>iron,</b> but produced a 'bloom' (a mixture of iron and slag) which could be converted to wrought iron by repeated heating and hammering. Another, even earlier, smelting hearth is known from West Runton, 17km (10mi) further east on the Norfolk coast. The main ore in this area is the iron-rich local carrstone.|$|E

50|$|Salts {{can appear}} to be clear and {{transparent}} (sodium chloride), opaque, and even <b>metallic</b> and lustrous (<b>iron</b> disulfide). In many cases, the apparent opacity or transparency are only related to the difference in size of the individual monocrystals.
