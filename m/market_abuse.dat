25|$|In 2006, while {{testifying before}} Senator Arlen Specter and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mack, Pequot Capital and the SEC lack of oversight, {{he warned that}} SEC {{enforcement}} was dangerously lax. He said that the SEC had recovered a mere $110,000 from hedge fund insider trading over one year when the Committee itself had found evidence that over a one-year period, more than 41% of all mergers and acquisitions of over a billion dollars involved insider trading. Aguirre warned that lack of effective oversight of rampant corruption was allowing Wall Street the same unregulated <b>market</b> <b>abuse</b> and leveraging that caused the Wall Street crash of 1929. In 2008, he delivered a similar message at the Sibos conference in Vienna. Just prior {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns, he {{wrote a letter to the}} Senate Banking Committee that the nation's banks, and particularly Bear Stearns, were at risk because of subprime debt exposure and credit default swaps. In September 2008, during the debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Aguirre's projections on the costs of the taxpayer bailout were cited on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E

40|$|In {{the most}} liberalized {{electricity}} <b>markets,</b> <b>abuse</b> of <b>market</b> {{power is a}} concern related to oligopolistic market structures, flaws in market architecture, and the specific characteristics of electricity generation and demand. Several methods have been suggested to improve the competitiveness of the liberalized electricity markets and to reallocate rents from generators to consumers. In this paper we study to what extend divestitures can improve the competitiveness of the electricity market. We quantify the expected developments under different divestiture scenarios for the German market, using Cournot and Supply Function Equilibrium simulations. We find an overall welfare gain in both models and show that those gains are highest if the divested assets are sold to independent and small firms, preventing the formation of additional firms that set prices strategically. ...|$|R

The situation is further aggravated by the placement of herbal medicine under the category of seemingly benign dietary supplements. In addition, disturbing news of contaminations and herbal substitutions all point to the need for a new parameter set up by the government.

The present systematic review aims to review and synthesize existing significant findings for effect of plain cigarette packaging, discuss implications for Hong Kong cigarette packaging policy, and offer suggestions for future direction {{in the area of}} research studies. A total of 21 studies were selected and qualified through the PRISMA Statement. Results were synthesized according to primary and secondary findings. Significant findings indicate that plain cigarette packages lower the attractiveness of a pack, weaken the reinforcement of falsely perceived product strength and arm, while increase the effectiveness of health warnings. The relatively new topic gives the present review its strengths and limitations.
