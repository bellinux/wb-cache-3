5|$|Massachusetts {{generally}} ranks highly {{among states}} in most health and disease prevention categories. In 2014, the United Health Foundation ranked {{the state as}} third-healthiest overall. Massachusetts has the <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> per 100,000 residents, the second-lowest infant mortality rate, and the lowest percentage of uninsured residents (for both {{children as well as}} the total population). According to Businessweek, commonwealth residents have an average life expectancy of 78.4 years, the fifth-longest in the country. 37.2% of the population is overweight and 21.7% is obese, and Massachusetts ranks sixth-highest in the percentage of residents who are considered neither obese nor overweight (41.1%). Massachusetts also ranks above average in the prevalence of binge drinking, which is the 20th-highest in the country.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{believed}} many of America's dietary {{problems were}} due to <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> not being well informed about nutrition.

25|$|The United States {{medical system}} {{is based on}} a {{fee-for-service}} model, in which doctors are paid on the basis of ordering individual tests and procedures, so that <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> will not get paid when they do not recommend (or recommend against) a given treatment. This system creates incentives for doctors to recommend additional treatments, rather than exercising evidence-based restraint.|$|E

25|$|Erythromelalgia {{remains a}} rare {{condition}} that <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> are completely unaware of; consequently, {{it may take}} years before EM patients receive proper pain control. As with many other rare conditions, management of EM is frequently patient-led, {{as they are in}} many cases more knowledgeable about their condition and what tests and treatments are appropriate.|$|E
25|$|After a {{complete}} examination, the colposcopist determines the areas {{with the highest}} degree of visible abnormality and may obtain biopsies from these areas using a long biopsy instrument, such as a punch forceps, SpiraBrush CX or SoftBiopsy. <b>Most</b> <b>doctors</b> and patients consider anesthesia unnecessary; however, some colposcopists now recommend and use a topical anesthetic such as lidocaine or a cervical block to decrease patient discomfort, particularly if many biopsy samples are taken.|$|E
25|$|Delany {{worked for}} a brief period as {{principal}} of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During another cholera outbreak in 1854, <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, as no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control the epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for the victims. Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African American education (Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980). He is not counted among African American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.|$|E

25|$|Doctors {{wishing to}} pursue a {{speciality}} must take entrance exams at the public/private institution of their choice that offers them. It is easier for students in private Medical Schools to obtain a residency in a Private Hospital, especially when the university has its own hospital, as the university holds positions specifically for its graduates. Speciality courses last about two to five years, depending on the branch of medicine the physician has chosen. There is no legal limit {{for the number of}} specialities a doctor can learn, although <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> choose to do one and then they sub-specialise for further job opportunities and less overall competition, along with higher wages.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
25|$|When World War II began, Gregg was a {{paediatric}} ophthalmologist, at a {{time when}} <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> had joined the army {{and he was one of}} few eye doctors in Sydney. Gregg noticed a high incidence of congenital cataracts in infants arriving at his surgery – two to three times the normal rate that would be expected from hereditary factors. He overheard a conversation between several mothers whose babies had cataracts, in which they mentioned that they had suffered from German measles (rubella) during pregnancy. Investigating the medical records of children with similar conditions, Gregg discovered that out of 78 affected children, 68 had been exposed to rubella in utero. There had been an outbreak of rubella and meningitis in Australian army camps in 1941, which had been transmitted to the wider community when the men returned to their families.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E
25|$|Cuba {{provides}} more medical personnel {{to the developing}} world than all the G8 countries combined. Since 1976, Cuban professors of medicine have helped establish 10 medical facilities in developing countries abroad. In the 1970s, the Cuban state initiated bilateral service contracts and various money-making strategies. Cuba has entered into agreements with United Nations agencies specializing in health: PAHO/WHO, UNICEF, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP). Since 1989, this collaboration has played {{a very important role}} in that Cuba, in addition to obtaining the benefits of being a member country, has strengthened its relations with institutions of excellence and has been able to disseminate some of its own advances and technologies In the 1980s, Cuba's decision to withdraw military assistance from the Marxist–Leninist regimes in Ethiopia and Angola was partly rooted in their inability to meet payments. In 1986, Cuba had 219 doctors per 100,000 people (compared with 423.7 doctors in the Soviet Union, which had the <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> among industrialized countries). As of 2005, Cuba became the world leader in the ratio of doctors to population with 67 doctors per 10,000 population as compared with 43 in the Russian Federation and 24 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Rodney Stark {{writes that}} {{a key to}} Christian Science's appeal {{at the time was}} that its success rate {{compared}} favorably with that of physicians, particularly when it came to women's health. <b>Most</b> <b>doctors</b> had not been to medical school, there were no antibiotics, and surgical practices were poor. By comparison the placebo effect (being treated at all, no matter what the treatment was) worked well. Stark argues that the [...] "very elaborate and intensely psychological Christian Science 'treatments' maximize such effects, while having the advantage of not causing further harm." ...|$|E

[...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus."

2500|$|Some anti-vaccine activists {{protest against}} the {{administration}} of a vaccine against mumps, claiming that the attenuated vaccine strain is harmful, and/or that the wild disease is beneficial.

Claims have been made that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism and inflammatory bowel disease, including one study by Andrew Wakefield. The paper was discredited and retracted in 2010 and Wakefield was later stripped of his license after his work was found to be an [...] "elaborate fraud". Also, subsequent studies indicate no link between vaccination with the MMR and autism. Since the dangers of the disease are well known, and the dangers of the vaccine are quite minimal, <b>most</b> <b>doctors</b> recommend vaccination.|$|E
