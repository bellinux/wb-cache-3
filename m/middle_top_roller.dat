40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in ring spinning. To understand the formation principle of the triangle zone, a dynamic mesh model with SIMPLEC algorithm is employed to study airflow around the rotating front roller-pair. The effects of both the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> offset and the drafting inclination angle are also discussed. The bubble-type vortex breakdown and vortices around two cylinders are observed. The bubble-type vortices will help the edge fibers to converge to the center. A contour line with special value is defined to describe the spinning triangle. A dynamic triangle zone is also observed with time. As the forward offset of the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> increases, the velocities in the stream-wise (x- and y-) directions decrease and the maximum values of the skin friction deflect gradually towards {{the apex of the}} roller. However, the z-velocity for the 3 mm <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> offset is the largest and results in a good converging for fibers and, consequently, increases the yarn tension. With increasing the inclination angle, the velocities increase while both the defined triangle zones and the maximum values of the friction coefficients decrease, thus speeding up the fibers transportation. The simulation results agree well with the theory analysis and experiments of spinning. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bendability is {{constrained}} by maximum <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> load imparting {{capacity of the}} machine. Maximum load is encountered during the edge pre-bending stage of roller bending. Capacity of 3 -roller plate bending machine is specified by maximum thickness and minimum shell diameter combinations that can be pre-bend for given plate material of maximum width. Commercially available plate width or width of the plate that can be accommodated on machine decides the maximum rolling width. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) provide the machine capacity chart based on reference material considering perfectly plastic material model. Reported work shows the bendability analysis of heavy duty 3 -roller plate bending machine. The input variables for the industry are plate thickness, shell diameter and material property parameters, as it is fixed by the design. Analytical models of equivalent thickness, equivalent width and maximum width based on power law material model were derived to study the bendability. Equation of maximum width provides bendability for designed configuration i. e. material property, shell diameter and thickness combinations within the machine limitations. Equivalent thicknesses based on perfectly plastic and power law material model were compared for four different materials grades of C-Mn steel in order to predict the bend-ability. Effect of <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> offset on the bendability at maximum <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> load imparting capacity is reported.

40|$|Conical {{sections}} and shells are produce using 3 -roller conical bending machines. In this conical bending process, the blank is given static bending {{by placing the}} blank over the bottom rollers and lowering the <b>top</b> <b>roller.</b> The rollers are rotated than to get roll bending action. Static bending of the plate requires larger force and it is done in multiple stages to lower down the value of required force [Gajjar et. al., 2008]. The total deflection of the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> required is divided in steps to get the multipass bending. The machine is designed {{on the basis of}} maximum reaction forces during bending. In this paper an analytical model is proposed for the prediction of bending force during the multiple pass 3 -roller conical bending. Multipass bending experiments are carried out to validate the developed model. Experimental results do not match exactly with the analytical results. So a correction factor for each pass has been found out and applied to the analytical results. The corrected analytical results match with experimental results quite satisfactorily. The model derived can be effectively used to study the effect of various parameters on the bending force and can be helpful to the researchers working in this area...|$|R
50|$|In essence the Char D2 is an {{improved}} Char D1. The different turret type used, increases its height somewhat to 266.6 centimetres; the hull is 175.5 centimetres high. The {{length of the}} hull, without tail, is 546 centimetres; its width is reduced to 222.3 centimetres {{through the use of}} a narrower track, 35 centimetres wide. The suspension is largely identical but the <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> to which a tension wheel is added, are placed somewhat higher to prevent track resonance, a persistent problem with the Char D1. The armour plate covering the three vertical coil springs consists of six instead of eight panels; mud-chutes are added below each <b>top</b> <b>roller.</b> There are three bogies per side, each with four road wheels, a coil spring and two shock absorbers. In front, and at the back below the sprocket, there is a tension wheel with its own damper; identical to the road wheels proper they bring the total number of such wheels to fourteen. Another change are the fenders with large stowage bins that give the false impression to be part of the main armour.|$|R

Thomas answered on 5 February that there was no danger of this; anyway he had just happened to affirm on 1 February the policy of General Mourret, who had already ordered the simultaneous development of three prototypes: the lightened [...] "A" [...] version, weighing thirty tons, having a length of 6.92 metres, with a suspension featuring twenty-nine double road wheels, four main bogies and five <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> powered by two Renault 200 hp engines and to be equipped with a 75 mm gun, to fulfil the original order of 20 October; the [...] "B" [...] version of forty-five tons with a hull lengthened to 7.39 metres, armed with a 75 mm gun and two machine guns, with a suspension featuring thirty road wheels, five main bogies and six <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> using a new 380 hp engine and a petro-hydraulic transmission and the [...] "C" [...] version of 62 tons with a 75 mm gun, a length of 9.31 meters, a suspension featuring forty-five road wheels, six main bogies and nine <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> and four engines of 110 hp combined with a petro-electrical transmission. Nivelle's misgivings were reinforced by inquiries from a parliamentary financial commission led by Pierre Renaudel. A plan by Breton to immediately order fifty vehicles more or less identical to the mock-up was therefore rejected. The 1 February order of two additional prototypes was confirmed by the CCAS on 7 February. Eventually the [...] "FCM 1A" [...] would be developed with a 105 mm gun and the [...] "FCM 1B" [...] would use a petrol-mechanical transmission.|$|R
