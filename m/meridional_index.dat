40|$|ABSTRACT-Within the {{framework}} of a detailed dynamic climatology of the large-scale circulation over the Northern Hemisphere, data from 15 yr of daily 700 -mb maps havc been used to investigate the temporal behavior of hemispherically averaged geostrophic zonal and <b>meridional</b> <b>indices.</b> A number of such indices were derived for both fixed and variable latitude bands. Their mean annual pattern, interannual variability, and time history through the 15 yr of record have been established. The absence of statistically significant correlations between zonal and meridional flow on a short-term time scale (days to weeks) is established, while high correlations are apparent on the annual scale. The 15 -yr record also indicates the sensitivity of the <b>meridional</b> <b>indices</b> to changes in the analysis techniques used to derive the hemispheric gridpoint data from the raw radiosonde observations. Finally, the capability of attaining a high resolution in time (about 3 days on the average) because of the daily data record allows a much more detailed description of the annual change in the large-scale circulation character than was previously possible by means of monthly averages. Certain times of the year appear to be fairly quiet while, at other times, distinct breaks in the circulation patterns are evident. This is a first indication that hemispheric wide singularities indeed exist. 1...|$|R
40|$|A tree-ring {{chronology}} network {{recently developed}} from the subantarctic forests provides an opportunity to study long-term climatic variability at higher latitudes in the South American sector of the Southern Ocean. Based on the longest pressure records available in the South American-Antarctic Peninsula (SAAP) sector of the Southern Oceans, zonal and <b>meridional</b> <b>indices</b> {{have been developed for}} the region. Temperature records in southern South America and the Antarctic Peninsula are strongly affected by the strength of the meridional flow, whereas precipitation variations along the Pacific coast in southern South America are more related to changes in the zonal circulation at higher latitudes. We employed dendroclimatic techniques for reconstructing both the zonal (ZSAAP) and the <b>meridional</b> (MSAAP) circulation <b>indices</b> over the past four centuries. The ZSAAP reconstruction shows dominant modes of variation at around 4. 4 and 5 years, which may be associated with the proposed Antarctic Circumpolar Wave in the Southern Oceans. Contrasting patterns in meridionality during the past two centuries are observed in the MSAAP reconstruction. Since the mid 1950 s the northerly flow has steady increased, reaching unprecedented levels during the 1980 s {{in the context of the}} past 400 years...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Hemisphere 700 mb contour heights from 20 N to 70 N for {{the period}} 1947 - 1970 are studied in {{conjunction}} with 272 key days, where the daily increase of the Ci index equals or exceeds 1. 0. The superposed epoch method is applied from 33 days before to 66 days after the key day {{for a variety of}} zonal and <b>meridional</b> <b>indices.</b> It is shown that the 700 mb height difference between 20 N and 55 N increases significantly in winter 4 days following geomagnetic disturbance (in summer a less prominent but statistically significant increase is found 2 days earlier). The effect is most clear in winter in the quadrant 90 - 175 W and corresponds to a 7 % increase in the mean geostrophic westerly flow. The statistical significance of the results is established by applying Student's t-test to the difference of each daily mean from the continuum...|$|R

An effort is presently made to identify a distinguishing class of planetary wave modes {{in the course of}} interpreting these data, with special attention being given to the equatorial plume features observed. A comparative evaluation of horizontal dispersion properties for linear wave modes on an equatorial beta plane suggests that the Rossby modes with a <b>meridional</b> structure <b>index</b> of 1 and an equivalent depth of 2 - 4 km are the interpretation most nearly consistent with all of the observational data for an equatorially trapped, wavenumber 12 pattern...|$|R
40|$|A low-order {{barotropic}} {{system with}} Newtonian forcing and dissipation is investigated. The system has one {{component in the}} zonal flow characterized by a Legendre function and two components in the eddy flow having the same longitudinal wave number, but different <b>meridional</b> <b>indices</b> and described by two associated Legendre functions. Five real amplitudes characterizing the system and a system of five ordinary, non-linear differential equations describe the behaviour of the system. The steady states of the system can be determined by a numerical solution of a 9 th degree equation for a given intensity of the forcing. Section 3 contains {{a description of the}} determination of the steady states and shows that up to five steady states may exist for a given forcing. The most complicated of the steady states have energy in all components of the system and the non-linear exchange of energy among the components is essential for maintaining the state. Other steady states are either zonal or contain energy in one component only. A general procedure for the determination of the stability of a given steady state is outlined in Section 4 together with a determination of the stability of all steady states within a given parameter range in the forcing. It turns out that among the steady states which have energy in the wave components we find both stable and unstable configurations. It would thus appear that this result is in general agreement with the synoptic experience that some wave configurations can exist in a relatively unchanged form for a long time while others, presumably corresponding to the unstable configurations, will change rapidly. A close correspondence with real atmospheric conditions is impossible in a low-order system. The final part of Section 4 gives the result of some numerical experiments with the simple system to illustrate that the type of initial disturbance given to a steady, unstable state will determine the asymptotic steady state in a case where two or more such states exist. 1...|$|R

We have used X-ray diffraction of a thick basement membrane, bovine lens capsule, to provide information. Under constant load, lens capsule gave a collagen diffraction pattern of a similar quality to unstretched rat rail tendon. In addition there were clear <b>meridional</b> reflections which <b>indexed</b> as orders of 10 nm, and equatorial reflections at 2. 1 and 3. 8 nm.

40|$|A {{network of}} fifteen Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (Celerytop Pine) chronologies for Tasmania, Australia, is developed. These sites {{effectively}} form north-south and east-west transects across the state, ranging in elevation from sea level to 850 m above sea level. Crossdating is established between sites {{spread across the}} state, indicating {{the existence of a}} common broadscale control mechanism. The growth response to a number of climatic variables, including maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, zonal and <b>meridional</b> <b>indices,</b> and the. Southern Oscillation Index is investigated. The most prominent features of the response functions produced for these variables are a consistency across sites in their response, especially so for northern sites, and a significant and negative correlation with prior growing season temperatures. High frequency variability in the quasibiennial range dominates the spectra of ring width series and is investigated in an attempt to determine whether it contains statistically significant climate information. Strong evidence for the influence of a climatic factor is not apparent, although the influence of the Zonal Index may be significant. Maximum temperature, the variable most consistently and most strongly correlated with ring widths, is used as the basis for climatic reconstruction on time scales greater than 2 years. Attempts to reconstruct climate by the more traditional technique of principal components regression were unsatisfactory, with insufficient variance due to climate being explained. Structural time series analysis is adapted for dendroclimatic reconstruction and some improvements in models result. The structural time series reconstructions show some differences between different regions of the state over the twentieth century which apparently did not exist in the previous century. While these reconstructions approximately trace the trend of increasing temperatures indicated by high altitude Lagarostrobos franklinii (Huon Pine) and instrumental records over the past century, there remain some significant differences in reconstructions from the two species. Different optimal temperatures for photosynthesis associated with elevational differences of sites are consistent with these differences. In large part, the limitations revealed through an examination of climate response of this species, and through the development of models for climatic reconstruction, relate to physiological questions concerning the species and point to a need for more detailed investigation of physiological aspects of species used for dendroclimatic work. Such investigations would allow a fuller utilisation of the potential offered by these species, and networks of them, as well as opening the way {{to a better understanding of}} resultant climatic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrofibrils are {{ubiquitous}} matrix polymers {{which are}} thought to provide elastic properties in all extracellular matrix structures. The major component of the elastic microfibrils is the protein fibrillin; its molecular structure is unknown. In electron microscopy, microfibrils appear as beaded structures exhibiting a variable periodicity, indicating {{that they may be}} elastomeric. The X-ray diffraction of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in the form of zonular filaments from bovine eyes exhibits <b>meridional</b> diffraction peaks <b>indexing</b> on a fundamental periodicity of 55 nm in the relaxed state. The application of a 40 % extension produced a lengthening of the periodicity by 3 % as judged by alteration of the D spacing of the principal peaks. This effect was shown to be reversible. Changes in the periodicity of the meridional reflections indicate changes in the fundamental structure of the microfilaments, but cannot account for all long range elastomeric properties of fibrillin-containing microfibrils...|$|R
40|$|Examined are {{statistical}} {{aspects of}} the 715 tropical cyclones that formed in the North Atlantic basin during the interval 1945 - 2010. These 715 tropical cyclones include 306 storms that attained only tropical storm strength, 409 hurricanes, 179 major or intense hurricanes, and 108 storms that struck the US coastline as hurricanes. Comparisons made using 10 -year moving average (10 -yma) values between tropical cyclone parametric values and surface air and ENSO-related parametric values indicate strong correlations to exist, in particular, against the Armagh Observatory (Northern Ireland) surface air temperature, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) <b>index,</b> the Atlantic <b>Meridional</b> Mode (AMM) <b>index,</b> and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, {{in addition to the}} Oceanic Ni o index (ONI) and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) indices.

40|$|We {{present the}} first meridional transects of {{atmospheric}} O 2 and CO 2 over the Atlantic Ocean. We combine these measurements into the tracer atmospheric potential oxygen (APO), {{which is a}} measure of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric O 2 variations. Our new in situ measurement system, deployed on board a commercial container ship during 2015, performs as well as or better than existing similar measurement systems. The data show small short-term variability (hours to days), a step-change corresponding to the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and seasonal cycles that vary with latitude. In contrast to data from the Pacific Ocean and to previous modeling studies, our Atlantic Ocean APO data show no significant bulge in the tropics. This difference cannot be accounted for by interannual variability in the position of the ITCZ or the Atlantic <b>Meridional</b> Mode <b>Index</b> and appears to be a persistent feature of the Atlantic Ocean system. Modeled APO using the TM 3 atmospheric transport model does exhibit a significant bulge over the Atlantic and overestimates the interhemispheric gradient in APO over the Atlantic Ocean. These results indicate that either there are inaccuracies in the oceanic flux data products in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean region, or that there are atmospheric transport inaccuracies in the model, or a combination of both. Our shipboard O 2 and CO 2 measurements are ongoing and will reveal the long-term nature of equatorial APO outgassing over the Atlantic as more data become available...|$|R
40|$|Microfibrils are {{ubiquitous}} fibrillin-rich polymers {{that are}} thought to provide long-range elasticity to extracellular matrices, including the zonular filaments of mammalian eyes. X-ray diffraction of hydrated bovine zonular filaments demonstrated <b>meridional</b> diffraction peaks <b>indexing</b> on a fundamental axial periodicity (D) of ∼ 56 nm. A Ca 2 +-induced reversible change in the intensities of the meridional Bragg peaks indicated that supramolecular rearrangements occurred in response to altered concentrations of free Ca 2 +. In the presence of Ca 2 +, the dominant diffracting subspecies were microfibrils aligned in an axial 0. 33 -D stagger. The removal of Ca 2 + caused an enhanced regularity in molecular spacing of individual microfibrils, and the contribution from microfibrils not involved in staggered arrays became more dominant. Scanning transmission electron microscopy of isolated microfibrils revealed that Ca 2 + removal or addition caused significant, reversible changes in microfibril mass distribution and periodicity. These results were consistent with evidence from x-ray diffraction. Simulated meridional x-ray diffraction profiles and analyses of isolated Ca 2 +-containing, staggered microfibrillar arrays were used to interpret the effects of Ca 2 +. These observations highlight the importance of Ca 2 + to microfibrils and microfibrillar arrays in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Global climatic {{processes}} which {{control the}} interannual variability of summer rainfall over South Africa are studied. Monthly and seasonal rainfall variations are analysed {{with respect to}} fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and tropospheric winds. OLR {{is used as a}} proxy for convective intensity and for the identification of areas of sympathy and opposition to convection over South Africa. Wind data (and derived parameters) are employed to explore large- scale tropical dynamical structures. Plausible explanations are offered for the observed associations. A change in sign of the correlation structure from the October/November rainfall regime to the December through March regime is indicative of a shift from downstream advective processes (Atlantic side) to a teleconnection-type of behaviour (Indian Ocean side). Rainfall variations during the late summer months show significant (and negative) links with SST fluctuations within the equatorial/tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean areas and are consistent with results obtained in analyses with respect to OLR fluctuations. December OLR in the Western Equatorial Indian Ocean is associated with {{a large portion of the}} variance in late summer rainfall, and points to a possible relation with the evolution of the Indian monsoon. The positive association implies that reduced cloudiness off the eastern coast of equatorial Africa in the spring precedes above normal mid- and late- summer rainfall over South Africa. Vertical mass overturnings are investigated through the velocity potential and derived parameters (the Zonal Circulation and <b>Meridional</b> Circulation <b>Indices).</b> The results suggest that the vertical tropospheric cells are among the important associated components which modulate climate across southern Africa, and that broad scale flows have an impact upon regional circulation cells. Evaluation of the vertical circulations with respect to wet and dry composites reveals that the Walker-type cell which connects a branch over the Indian Ocean gradually forms after November and reaches peak development in February. A slight increase of SST in the Central Equatorial Indian Ocean (CEI) modifies the Walker cell anomaly leading to below normal summer rainfall over South Africa. Additional thermodynamic inputs in the CEI region are conducive to deeper convection, hence elevated outflow signatures are observed in the velocity potential and related fields. It is conjectured that the teleconnections between South Africa, the CEI and the remote Pacific Ocean regulate the depth of moisture influx and convergence over South Africa. Based on the results of this study, it is believed that empirical models could be designed for long-range prediction of summer rainfall anomalies over the central interior of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Zonal and <b>meridional</b> {{pressure}} gradient <b>indices</b> of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation are analysed in the mid-to-high (35 - 65 °S) latitude zone. The dearth of land regions, and hence long pressure records, means {{that these are}} restricted to the southern South American and New Zealand sectors. The Trans Polar Index (TPI) is the only large-scale station pressure based extratropical SH index that has been proposed, {{and is based on}} the normalised pressure difference between Hobart, Tasmania and Stanley, Falklands. This index is compared with variants which involve stations in the vicinity of New Zealand and southern South America. The index shows considerable year-to-year and some decadal-scale variability and is a measure of wavenumber 1 of the SH pressure field. Significant correlations (r ~ - 0. 3 to - 0. 5) occur between the TPI and southern South American temperatures in the austral summer and autumn seasons. Similar size correlations of the opposite sign occur in New Zealand but only in the austral summer season. In New Zealand and southern South America, temperature series are strongly affected by the strength of the local meridional circulation (r values ~ - 0. 4 to - 0. 7 over New Zealand depending on season and period and values of ~ - 0. 2 to - 0. 4 for southern South America). In both regions there is no concomitant increase in northerly flow or decrease in southerly flow to explain the long-term increase in temperatures. The relationships are mostly at the interannual rather than the decadal and longer timescales. The decadal temperature rise, therefore, reflects a general warming of the Southern Ocean, rather than decadal-scale variations in the circulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} decadal {{predictions}} {{has been conducted}} with the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office's (GMAO's) GEOS- 5 Atmosphere-Ocean general circulation model. The hind casts are initialized every December 1 st from 1959 to 2010, following the CMIP 5 experimental protocol for decadal predictions. The initial conditions are from a multivariate ensemble optimal interpolation ocean and sea-ice reanalysis, and from GMAO's atmospheric reanalysis, the modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications. The mean forecast skill of a three-member-ensemble is {{compared to that of}} an experiment without initialization but also forced with observed greenhouse gases. The results show that initialization increases the forecast skill of North Atlantic sea surface temperature compared to the uninitialized runs, with the increase in skill maintained for almost a decade over the subtropical and mid-latitude Atlantic. On the other hand, the initialization reduces the skill in predicting the warming trend over some regions outside the Atlantic. The annual-mean Atlantic <b>meridional</b> overturning circulation <b>index,</b> which is defined here as the maximum of the zonally-integrated overturning stream function at mid-latitude, is predictable up to a 4 -year lead time, consistent with the predictable signal in upper ocean heat content over the North Atlantic. While the 6 - to 9 -year forecast skill measured by mean squared skill score shows 50 percent improvement in the upper ocean heat content over the subtropical and mid-latitude Atlantic, prediction skill is relatively low in the sub-polar gyre. This low skill {{is due in part to}} features in the spatial pattern of the dominant simulated decadal mode in upper ocean heat content over this region that differ from observations. An analysis of the large-scale temperature budget shows that this is the result of a model bias, implying that realistic simulation of the climatological fields is crucial for skillful decadal forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicaciónExtratropical {{precipitation}} {{is primarily}} produced by cold and warm fronts associated with surface cyclones and upper-level troughs. The growth of these midlatitude storms is partially {{controlled by the}} dry baroclinicity of the troposphere, which in turn can be roughly quantified by {{the intensity of the}} upper-level zonal flow. Orographic rainfall, {{an important component of the}} precipitation in several midlatitude regions, is also partially determined by the intensity of the cross-mountain midlevel winds. Thus, at monthly and longer time scales, variations of precipitation and zonal flow aloft (as well as wind shear) at a given location should exhibit some degree of coherence. In this work the local covariability of these variables is documented over intermonthly and interannual time scales, using global precipitation products and atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 to 2004. The spatial correspondence between the precipitation and two indices of synoptic activity in the extratropics is also documented. The local correlation (r(o)) between monthly anomalies of precipitation and upper-level (300 hPa) zonal flow varies in space, from moderately and even highly significant values (r(o) similar to 0. 3 to 0. 7) over the midlatitude oceans to near zero over the interior of continental areas. Broadly similar results are found when considering the monthly variance of the high-pass-filtered <b>meridional</b> wind (an <b>index</b> of eddy activity) or the midlevel Eady growth rate. The local correlation map between precipitation and low-level (850 hPa) zonal flow is similar to its upper-level counterpart, but the correlations over open ocean are somewhat weaker, while orographic effects show up more clearly. The correlations are positive and large upstream of the major north-south-oriented mountain ranges, as strong westerlies promote upslope rain in addition to storm-related precipitation. In contrast, the correlation tends to be negative downstream of the ranges, as strong westerlies enhance the rain shadow effects over the lee side...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{identify}} weather type circulations in the South American sector and analyze their frequency, distribution and temporal variability. Daily averages of 1000 hPa geopotential heights {{for the period}} 1979 - 2001 were used in order to perform the weather type (WT) classification. The series of daily maps {{was obtained from the}} NCEP Reanalysis 2 data provided by the NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostics Center. The months analyzed were those when major precipitations in central-eastern Argentina occur (October to May). This period also corresponds to the growing season of the summer crops in this area. Using k-means clustering method on the most relevant T-mode principal components, a classification into 7 fundamental circulations emerged, based on daily anomalies of geopotential over southern South America region: WT 1, negative anomalies over the SW Atlantic and SW flow over the continent; WT 2, trough over the SE Pacific and ridge over the SW Atlantic; WT 3, positive anomalies over the southern tip of the continent; WT 4, ridge over the E of the continent; WT 5, ridge over the SE Pacific and S of the continent and trough downstream; WT 6, low-pressure system centred 45 S- 55 W; WT 7, negative anomalies over the southern tip of the continent. The temporal series of seasonal frequencies of the 7 WT were studied in order to find main characteristics. Major interannual variabilities were found for those groups with enhanced westerlies (WT 1 and WT 7) while the opposite behavior was found for those days characterized by a ridge at the east of the continent (WT 4) inducing subsidence at low levels. It was observed a progressive diminution in time of cold air advection situations (WT 5). This result is coincident with the increase of summer minimum temperature values observed in recent decades over the studied area. Meanwhile an increase in seasonal frequencies of enhanced mid-latitude westerlies and disturbances migration over Patagonia (WT 7) was detected. This group exhibited pronounced low frequencies in the strongest El Niño years (1982 / 83, 1991 / 92 and 1997 / 98) showing changes in low level circulation and in westerlies intensity during these years. The analysis of the monthly frequencies for each group displayed that WT 1 presents the highest frequencies in December in agreement with the maximum in the <b>meridional</b> circulation <b>index</b> (intense South Pacific high). Situations with SE flow over central Argentina (WT 3) reach their maximum during spring and fall, this is coincident with the monthly distribution of the SE windstorm (sudestada) in the Rio de la Plata estuary. The persistence of each group was also analyzed. The less persistent groups were WT 4 and WT 6 which represent opposite situations from the dynamical point of view (positive and negative anomalies at the east of the continent respectively). While WT 2 and WT 7 were the most persistent groups. Daily precipitation station data for the Pampas region was used in order to link the WT with the regional climate. It was found that widespread rainy days (more than 10 mm in all stations) were related to WT 3, WT 6 and WT 7. On the other hand, days with no precipitation over the whole area tended to be associated with WT 4. Pages: 495 - 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project has been to {{investigate}} how synoptic scale climate systems control the frequency of air pollution episodes {{in the city of}} Christchurch, New Zealand. The work has been done at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and data from the region has been analysed. Air pollution is, during winter time, a growing problem in Christchurch and the project was initiated by the regional environmental legislative body. The first part of the report is on finding relationships on a local-scale between particulate matter concentrations, ground temperature, temperature at 10 meters and wind speed. The data set used in the analysis comes from a monitoring station in St. Albans, situated in the north-east of Christchurch. In the second part, a connection is made thought correlation calculations between the results from the local-scale analysis and the synoptic situation observed over New Zealand during the same period. Two different data sets have been used in the analysis. One data set includes different weather patterns observed over New Zealand and the other data set includes different zonal and <b>meridional</b> circulation <b>indices.</b> A pressure index is also used, the Southern Oscillation Index. On the local-scale, a relationship has been found between the particulate matter concentration and the number of night hours with an inversion present. A correlation also exists between the wind speed and the number of night hours with an inversion present. The connection to the synoptic scale through cluster frequencies and circulation indices was found to be divergent. The cluster frequency analysis indicates on a direct correlation between the Southern Oscillation Index and the air pollution concentration in Christchurch, while the circulation indices analysis indicates on an inverse relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index and the air pollution concentration in Christchurch. Sammanfattning av ”Kopplingen mellan ENSO och aerosoler mindre än 10 μm i Christchurch” Avsikten med projektet har varit att undersöka om det finns ett samband mellan storskaliga vädersystem (synoptisk skala) och antalet lokalt inträffade händelser med höga halter av luftföroreningar. Arbetet har utförts vid University of Canterbury i Christchurch på Nya Zeeland och mätdata för denna region har analyserats. Luftföroreningar är här ett växande problem, speciellt vintertid, vilket de regionala lagstiftande myndigheterna har identifierat och önskat få utrett. I första delen av rapporten analyseras samband mellan lokala parametrar, så som temperatur vid marknivå och på 10 meters höjd, vindhastighet och koncentrationen av olika luftföroreningar. Data som använts i dessa analyser har uppmätts vid en mätstation placerad i St. Albans, vilken ligger i nordöstra delen av centrala Christchurch. I den andra delen av rapporten beräknas korrelationen mellan resultaten från den lokala analysen och olika synoptiska vädersituationer observerade över Nya Zeeland under motsvarande tidsperioder. Två databaser har använts vid analysen, dels en databas innehållande olika vädersituationer över Nya Zeeland och dels en innehållande olika cirkulationsindex. Dessutom användes också ett lufttrycksindex, ”The Southern Oscillation Index”. Två korrelationer har beräknats i den lokala analysdelen. Dels har ett samband mellan luftföroreningskoncentrationen och antalet timmar med en inversion närvarande nattetid beräknats samt en korrelation mellan vindhastighet och antalet timmar med en inversion närvarande nattetid. Kopplingen till den synoptiska skalan visar på två divergerande resultat. Analys genomförd med olika ”clusters” visar på ett direkt samband mellan ”The Southern Oscillaion Index” och luftföroreningskoncentrationen i Christchurch medan en analys genomförd för circulationsindex visar på ett omvänt samband mellan ”The Southern Oscillation Index” och luftföroreningskoncentrationen i Christchurch...|$|R
