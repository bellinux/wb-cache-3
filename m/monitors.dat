Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. <b>Monitors</b> relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E

40|$|Service <b>monitoring</b> is an {{important}} part in web service systems, since it aims to ensure that the functions and performance of the service have fulfill the customers' requirements, and detect the potential risks as early as possible. However, <b>monitoring</b> has its costs, which will cause the performance degradation of <b>monitored</b> service system and large resources consumption. If <b>monitoring</b> costs are higher than <b>monitoring</b> benefits, service <b>monitoring</b> will be meaningless. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the <b>monitoring</b> benefits and <b>monitoring</b> costs. Efficient service <b>monitoring</b> means cost-efficiently and time-efficiently of service <b>monitoring.</b> In order to maximize the functions of service <b>monitoring,</b> careful study on how to improve the efficiency of service <b>monitoring</b> is required. This thesis mainly presents a taxonomy of different approaches of service <b>monitoring.</b> It covers several existing optimization approaches, and describes them by giving examples. Since there are two main factors that will add <b>monitoring</b> costs, large amount of <b>monitored</b> objects and inappropriate <b>monitoring</b> approaches, this thesis makes comparisons among different <b>monitoring</b> technologies.

5|$|When the Romanians {{entered the}} war on 27 August 1916, the <b>monitors</b> were again at Rustschuk, and were {{immediately}} attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed the <b>monitors</b> but struck a lighter loaded with fuel. Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day, the Second Monitor Division, consisting of Bodrog and three other <b>monitors,</b> set fire to oil storage tanks, the railway station and magazines, and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer {{on their way back}} to Belene. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled.|$|E

Section ‘Monitoring as a service tools’ surveys a <b>monitoring</b> as a service tools, a recent development which abstracts much of the complexity of <b>monitoring</b> away from the user. Section ‘Taxonomy’ extrapolates a taxonomy from the surveyed tools and categorises them accordingly. We then use this taxonomy to identity how well current tools address the issues of cloud <b>monitoring</b> and analyse the future potential of cloud <b>monitoring</b> tools. Section ‘Monitoring as an engineering practice’ considers <b>monitoring</b> from a practical standpoint, discussing the socio-technical and organisational concerns that underpin the implementation of any <b>monitoring</b> strategy.

40|$|State <b>monitoring</b> is a {{fundamental}} building block for Cloud services. The demand for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as services (MaaS) continues to grow and is evidenced by CloudWatch from Amazon EC 2, which allows cloud consumers to pay for <b>monitoring</b> a selection of performance metrics with coarse-grained periodical sampling of runtime states. One of the key challenges for wide deployment of MaaS is to provide better balance among a set of critical quality and performance parameters, such as accuracy, cost, scalability and customizability. This dissertation research is dedicated to innovative {{research and development of}} an elastic framework for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as a service (MaaS). We analyze limitations of existing techniques, systematically identify the need and the challenges at different layers of a Cloud <b>monitoring</b> service platform, and develop a suite of distributed <b>monitoring</b> techniques to support for flexible <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure, cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> and monitoring-enhanced Cloud management. At the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure layer, we develop techniques to support multi-tenancy of <b>monitoring</b> services by exploring cost sharing between <b>monitoring</b> tasks and safeguarding <b>monitoring</b> resource usage. To provide elasticity in <b>monitoring,</b> we propose techniques to allow the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure to self-scale with <b>monitoring</b> demand. At the cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> layer, we devise several new state <b>monitoring</b> functionalities to meet unique functional requirements in Cloud <b>monitoring.</b> Violation likelihood state <b>monitoring</b> explores the benefits of consolidating <b>monitoring</b> workloads by allowing utility-driven <b>monitoring</b> intensity tuning on individual <b>monitoring</b> tasks and identifying correlations between <b>monitoring</b> tasks. Window based state <b>monitoring</b> leverages distributed windows for the best <b>monitoring</b> accuracy and communication efficiency. Reliable state <b>monitoring</b> is robust to both transient and long-lasting communication issues caused by component failures or cross-VM performance interferences. At the monitoring-enhanced Cloud management layer, we devise a novel technique to learn about the performance characteristics of both Cloud infrastructure and Cloud applications from cumulative performance <b>monitoring</b> data to increase the cloud deployment efficiency.

40|$|<b>Monitoring</b> {{systems are}} {{important}} for debugging and analyzing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In passive <b>monitoring,</b> a <b>monitoring</b> network needs to be deployed {{in addition to the}} network to be <b>monitored,</b> named the target network. The <b>monitoring</b> network captures and analyzes packets transmitted by the target network. An energy-efficient passive <b>monitoring</b> system is necessary when we need to <b>monitor</b> a WSN in a real scenario because the lifetime of the <b>monitoring</b> network is extended and, consequently, the target network benefits from the <b>monitoring</b> for a longer time. In this work, we have identified, analyzed and compared the main passive <b>monitoring</b> systems proposed for WSN. During our research, we did not identify any passive <b>monitoring</b> system for WSN that aims to reduce the energy consumption of the <b>monitoring</b> network. Therefore, we propose an Energy-efficient Passive <b>MOnitoring</b> SysTem for WSN named EPMOSt that provides <b>monitoring</b> information using a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. Thus, any management tool that supports the SNMP protocol can be integrated with this <b>monitoring</b> system. Experiments with real sensors were performed in several scenarios.
