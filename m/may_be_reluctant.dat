5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E
25|$|The sage of {{the ancient}} Near East was a self-effacing man of few words who did not provoke encounters. A holy man offers cures and exorcisms only when petitioned, and even then <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant.</b> Jesus seems to have {{displayed}} a similar style.|$|E
50|$|Experts and {{institutions}} <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to admit their own fallibility. Art historian Thomas Hoving estimates that {{various types of}} forged art comprise up to 40% of the art market.|$|R
50|$|According to this scenario, Agathocleia and Straton I only {{managed to}} {{maintain}} {{themselves in the}} eastern parts of the kingdom, Punjab and at times Gandhara. Paropamisadae and Pushkalavati were taken over by Zoilos I, perhaps because some of Agathocleia's subjects <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to accept an infant king with a queen regent.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> a {{correlation}} between journal ranking and coercive citation. Some have suggested that larger and more highly ranked journals have more valuable reputations at stake, and thus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>reluctant</b> to jeopardize their reputations by using the practice. However, Wilhite and Fong found that: ...|$|R
25|$|Breastfeeding {{in public}} is {{forbidden}} in some jurisdictions, not legislated for in others, and a legal right {{in public and}} the workplace in yet others. Where it is a legal right, some mothers <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to breastfeed, and some people may object to the practice.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{nature of}} polyamory {{presents}} difficulties in structuring {{research into the}} stability of polyamorous relationships. For instance, polyamorists <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to disclose their relationship status due to potential negative consequences, and researchers may be unfamiliar with {{the full range of}} polyamorous behaviours, leading to poorly framed questions that give misleading results.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 22,000 practitioners in the US alone, but the number may be higher as some practitioners <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to disclose their religion on a government census or to an academic researcher. Of those living in the United States, some are fully committed priests and priestesses, others are godchildren or members of a particular house-tradition, and many are non-committal clients seeking help with their everyday problems.|$|E
5000|$|Iraqis in Jordan are {{estimated}} to number between 200.000 and comprise approximately 4-5 per cent of the total population. [...] Estimating {{the size of an}} immigrant population is difficult, as some Iraqis may have entered without a legal permit, or overstayed their permit. Parts of the Iraqi population in Jordan <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> toreveal their presence, in fear of deportation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{clinical}} practice, referral bias is {{more likely}} to occur when a preliminary diagnostic test is negative. Because many gold standard tests can be invasive, expensive, and carry a higher risk (e.g. angiography, biopsy, surgery), patients and physicians <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>reluctant</b> to undergo further work-up if a preliminary test is negative.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, it has {{appeared}} that broadcasters {{are more likely}} to scramble their signals when they become aware that home viewers and other [...] "unauthorized" [...] viewers are watching their signals. Therefore, those who know what signals <b>are</b> available <b>may</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to share that information in open forums. While sites exist that attempt to list currently viewable FTA signals, most of them are incomplete or do not contain current information. Such sites typically rely on reports of changes by viewers, and if viewers <b>are</b> <b>reluctant</b> to report new FTA signals for fear they might disappear, it becomes more of a challenge for such sites to maintain up-to-date listings.|$|R
25|$|The {{prohibition}} of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship {{even though they}} may feel a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Immigrants who have been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenship <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to become naturalized citizens as it would mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where questions arise {{as to whether the}} tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take part in research, and if they do agree to take part, they may not say how much cannabis they actually smoke.|$|E
25|$|Measuring the {{prevalence}} of homosexuality presents difficulties. It is necessary to consider the measuring criteria that are used, the cutoff point and the time span taken to define a sexual orientation. Many people, despite having same-sex attractions, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to identify themselves as gay or bisexual. The research must measure some characteristic {{that may or may}} not be defining of sexual orientation. The number of people with same-sex desires may be larger than the number of people who act on those desires, which in turn may be larger than the number of people who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} growing support for Reconciliation and {{increasing}} awareness about the role early childhood educators play in enacting Reconciliation as part of everyday practice, some educators continue to question their role in this work. Open conversations across staff teams are critical to understanding why some members of staff <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>reluctant</b> to take ownership of Reconciliation work {{and how they can}} be supported to move forward...|$|R
30|$|Women {{undergoing}} gynaecological {{laparoscopic surgery}} <b>may</b> initially <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to discuss the}} risks of the procedure in general terms in up to one-third of cases (Moore et al. 2002). When the risks and complications are explained to them, however, almost all feel {{it is important to}} be fully informed of the appropriate risk of the procedure. Most risk figures given to patients will be in terms of the simplest basic risk (i.e. the absolute risk). This is the actual risk due to be surgical intervention without placebo.|$|R
30|$|Evaluations and {{experiments}} {{are an important}} part of AR. Students are often used to research and to experimenting with different approaches and willing to evaluate them. Non-student contributors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>reluctant</b> to do so. Although this setting with mainly student developers is rather unusual, it allows to conduct more questionnaires and evaluations, which is important for research purposes. Moreover, students work on many FOSS projects and are not atypical FOSS contributors per se.|$|R
25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
2500|$|Mental health {{professionals}} {{and some other}} {{health professionals}} receive training in assessment and treatment [...] of suicidality. Suicide hotlines are widely available for people seeking help. However, some people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to discuss their suicidal thoughts, due to stigma, previous negative experiences, or other reasons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{decisions}} {{had to be}} made, {{including what}} to do about people who may find the new technology confusing, or who have no desire to receive more than the four or five channels they originally had, and who <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to buy a digital box to view the free channels. The government arranged for the BBC to administer a Digital Switchover Help Scheme to ensure that groups such as the over-75s and recipients of disability benefits did not lose their television services when analogue transmissions were switched off.|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} happiness finds that employment significantly contributes to well-being. We propose a dynamic model {{that explains why}} individuals <b>may</b> nonetheless <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to pick up low-paid work. Accepting low-paid work will put them in an adverse position in future wage bargaining, as employers could infer the individual's low reservation wage from his working history. Employers will exploit their knowledge by offering low wages to this individual in the future. Therefore, employees with low reservation wage strategically opt into unemployment to signal a high reservation wage. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{circumstances}} under which past service provisions have occurred enables clients to make more informed selection decisions regarding their future interaction partners. Service providers, however, <b>may</b> often <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to release such circumstances due to the cost and effort required, or to protect their interests. In response, we introduce a reputation-based incentivisation framework, which motivates providers towards the desired behaviour of reporting circumstances via influencing two reputation-related factors: the weights of past provider interactions, which directly impact the provider’s reputation estimate, and the overall confidence in such estimate...|$|R
2500|$|It {{is often}} the case that a person, faced with {{real-world}} gambles with money, does not act to maximize the expected value of their dollar assets. [...] For example, a person who only possesses $1000 in savings <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to risk it all for a 20% chance odds to win $10,000, even though ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the best}} {{large-scale}} hacks (e.g. the Caltech cannon heist) have involved multiple teams of hackers working on coordinated but diverse subtasks such as fund-raising, [...] "social engineering", rigging, transportation logistics, gold electroplating, and precision numerical controlled machining, calling {{on a wide range}} of technical and management skills. [...] Not surprisingly, some hacker teams have gone on to found start-up business ventures, though they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to reveal their earlier exploits until many years have passed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{it used to}} be common for each party to the dispute to appoint an {{arbitrator}} and for those two arbitrators to appoint a third arbitrator (who {{may or may not be}} called an umpire). [...] However, the two arbitrators appointed by the parties to the dispute would essentially act as advocates for the party who appointed them, and the umpire would effectively act as a sole arbitrator. [...] However, such systems can lead to difficulty, as other countries <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to enforce an arbitration award where two of the three [...] "arbitrators" [...] are clearly unable to demonstrate impartiality or independence. The standards for enforcing such awards are set out in the New York Convention, as interpreted by local law.|$|E

50|$|Under her contract, Taglioni was {{to appear}} in Nuns about a dozen times. She left after six. It is {{possible}} that the erotic implications of the nuns' ballet did not set well with her. She <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to appear in}} a ballet within an opera. A foot injury and the accidents that marred the first performance may have given the ballerina pause for thought. Bad press directed at her father may have caused Taglioni to withdraw. Taglioni was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, who danced the role 232 times.|$|R
50|$|Most such frauds are not {{reported}} by the victims for several reasons. First, they may feel terribly ashamed {{that they could be}} so naïve. Second, many of the scams will involve the victim knowingly agreeing to receive the proceeds of a crime - e.g. he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> informed that it is drug money, tax evasion money, or simply stolen. Sometimes the scammer will have persuaded the victim to incriminate himself, e.g. by falsifying a document, or lying on a tax declaration etc. The victim <b>may</b> thus <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to come forward and admit that he was knowingly participating in {{what he thought was a}} criminal scheme.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that stimulants do not {{exacerbate}} tics any more than placebo does, and suggest that stimulants may even reduce tic severity. A 2011 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that most major ADHD medications were effective in children with tics, and that stimulants did not generally worsen tics outside of individual cases. Methylphenidate, guanfacine, clonidine, and desipramine were associated with improvement of tic symptoms. Controversy remains, and the PDR continues to carry a warning that stimulants should not be used in the presence of tic disorders, so physicians <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to use them. Others are comfortable using them and even advocate for a stimulant trial when ADHD co-occurs with tics, because the symptoms of ADHD can be more impairing than tics.|$|E
2500|$|The multiverse {{idea has}} led to {{considerable}} research into the anthropic principle and has been {{of particular interest to}} particle physicists, because theories of everything do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory do make predictions that some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence of soon. Some multiverse theories are not falsifiable, thus scientists <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> to call any multiverse theory [...] "scientific". UNC-Chapel Hill professor Laura Mersini-Houghton claims that the WMAP cold spot may provide testable empirical evidence for a parallel universe, although this claim was recently refuted as the WMAP cold spot was found to be nothing more than a statistical artifact.|$|E
2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} against men includes physical, emotional and sexual forms of abuse, including mutual violence. Male domestic violence victims <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to get help}} for various reasons. One study investigated whether women who assaulted their male partners {{were more likely to}} avoid arrest even when the male contacts police, and found that, [...] "police are particularly unlikely to arrest women who assault their male partners." [...] The reason being that they [...] "assume that the man can protect himself from his female partner and that a woman's violence is not dangerous unless she assaults someone other than her partner". Another study concluded there is [...] "some support for qualitative research suggesting that court personnel are responsive to the gendered asymmetry of intimate partner violence, and may view female intimate violence perpetrators more as victims than offenders." [...] Despite this, arrests of female victims who fight back remains a widespread problem.|$|E
50|$|He {{fell ill}} {{in the spring}} of 1874 which began his long period of illness until his death. He {{recovered}} and made a four-month visit to Rome to be with his future priests.

30|$|A second {{possible}} {{reason for the}} lack of support for judging competency as a function of revealing Halloween costumes is the notion that Halloween is a holiday that provides freedom from social norms for a day. The women wearing the revealing costumes in our study <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> given a “pass” on ratings of competency because respondents knew the women were headed to a Halloween party, because it is fairly common knowledge that women’s commercial costumes are revealing, and because consumer choice is limited. Finally, because costumes are not worn for everyday dress, participants <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to judge the women’s competency based on the revealing costumes.|$|R
40|$|If medical {{confidentiality}} is not observed patients <b>may</b> well <b>be</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to disclose information}} to their doctors or even to seek medical advice. Therefore, argues the author, it is {{of the utmost importance}} that doctors strive to protect {{medical confidentiality}}, particularly now when it is under threat not only in this country but also overseas. The profession must cease to regard ethical issues to do with confidentiality, and indeed to do with all areas of medical practice, as abstract phenomena requiring no justification. If it does not then it will come under increasing and justified criticism from the community it serves...|$|R
