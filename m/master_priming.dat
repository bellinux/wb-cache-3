2500|$|Throughout shooting, Arri Alexa {{cameras were}} used; an Alexa M {{was used for}} {{handheld}} sequences, and an Alexa XT {{was attached to the}} Steadicam. Neither used matteboxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: [...] "We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face." [...] Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki {{went so far as to}} say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss <b>Master</b> <b>Primes.</b> Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying [...] "You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the [...] "intimacy" [...] he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.|$|R

50|$|Baahubali: The Beginning was {{produced}} in Tollywood, the center of Telugu language films in India. , the film series was considered the most expensive in India. In February 2011, S. S. Rajamouli announced that Prabhas will star in his upcoming movie. In January 2013, he announced that the working title as Baahubali and the actual film production started at Rock Gardens in Kurnool on 6 July 2013. The waterfall scenes in the film were shot at Athirappilly Falls in Kerala, huge sets for the Mahishmati kingdom were constructed at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and the snow episodes in the film were shot in Bulgaria. The screen writer, K. V. Vijayendra Prasad who wrote stories for most of Rajamouli's films once again penned the story for Baahubali. The film boasts of one year pre production work where in 15,000 story board sketches for the film were created which is highest for any Indian Film till date. More than 90 percent of the film had visually enhanced shots {{and according to the}} producer, more than 600 VFX artists worked for the film from 18 facilities around the world led by Makuta VFX and Firefly in Hyderabad, Prasad Studios in Hyderabad and Chennai, Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, Tau Films in Malaysia, and Dancing Digital Animation and Macrograph in South Korea. Makuta VFX which had prior experience of working with S.S.Rajamouli was chosen as principal visual effects studio. The cinematography of the movie was done by KK Senthil Kumar for 380 days using Arri Alexa XT camera with <b>Master</b> <b>Prime</b> lens marking Rajamouli's first film using digital camera. Most of the film was shot in ARRIRAW format in 4:3 aspect ratio while ARRIRAW 16.9 was used for slow motion shots at 120 fps. Open Gate format, which can utilise the full 3.4K sensor in the camera to produce frames larger than the standard ARRIRAW format was tapped in to get the maximum image quality in VFX shots. For the first time in Indian movies, 4K movie print was rendered with an aspect ratio of 1:1.88 as compared to Cinemascope at 1:2.35 to get the best cinematic experience in screens that support the 4K projection claimed the Producer. Sabu Cyril, production designer for the film created 10,000 different kinds of weaponry ranging from swords, helmets and armors required for the soldiers. To make the swords light weight Carbon-fibre was used instead of steel, the same material used in manufacture of Helicopter blades claimed the art director. 3D printing technology was used to create the head of 100 foot Bhallaladeva's character in the movie and flexi foam was used to create amours to make them light weight and to have the look of leather. V. Srinivas Mohan was chosen as visual effects supervisor and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the Editor. PM Satheesh was the sound designer and Peter Hein was responsible for the action sequences. The costume designers were Rama Rajamouli and Prasanthi Tipirneni. The line producer was M. M. Srivalli.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of four papers wherein we enumerate all prime {{alternating}} knots and links. In this first paper, we introduce four operators on knots and show that, when used according to very simple rules on the prime alternating knots of n crossings, the set of all prime alternating knots of n+ 1 crossings is obtained. The second paper (Part II) explains how to actually implement the operators in an efficient manner, although that is in a sense secondary to introduction of a complete invariant for prime alternating knots, called the master array of a prime alternating knot. The third paper in the series establishes a method for enumerating the prime alternating links. It is shown that one may choose any prime alternating link diagram of a given minimal crossing size and by applications of just two operators (namely T and OTS) to the selected seed link, one obtains all prime alternating link diagrams of the desired minimal crossing size.

40|$|Multimedia and {{multimodal}} interfaces {{reflect the}} growing technological possibilities of computer-based systems for {{interaction with the}} user. The ongoing increase in communication bandwidth and the growing variety of communication channels enable further improvement in the user interface. However, how this increased communication capacity can optimally be exploited is as yet unknown. Since the functionality of these computer-based systems also continues to grow, the increased complexity of interaction procedures {{and the difficulty of}} <b>mastering</b> them are <b>prime</b> issues in the design of 2 ̆ 2 easy to use 2 ̆ 2 multimodal user interfaces. In order to appreciate more fully what is involved in self-evident {{and at the same time}} efficient interaction between user and system, we will first briefly describe the layered-protocol model of computer-human dialogue as proposed by Taylor (1988 a). This conceptual framework emphasizes the relevance of layered feedback for the efficiency of communication. As indicated by Engel 2 ̆ 6 amp; Haakma (1993), in particular early feedback about the system's interpretation of the message part already received (I-feedback) as well as on machine expectations about message elements still to be received (E-feedback) are of relevance for the system's ease of use. Thereafter, as an interesting example of improved human-computer interaction through layered multimodal I- and E-feedback, an experimental trackball device will be described. It provides the user, in addition to the standard visual I-feedback about the current cursor position, with tactile E-feedback about the expected cursor target position.

40|$|In Celebration of 70 {{years of}} Asian StudiesChina and Inner Asia Session 164 : Gendering Social Change in Hong Kong: Cross-Media PerspectivesBefore the Asian {{economic}} crisis of 1997, the inferiority complex of the colonized Hong Kong male imagined a reversible power relation and found relief through a blown-up sense of economic superiority. This mainstream myth {{expressed in terms}} of capitalism and sexism boasted of out-doing the Western and Chinese colonizers in the capitalist game. Since the return to Chinese sovereignty, repeated financial crises, intensified neoliberalization of governance and the resulting increased monopolization of wealth and power, mainstream Hong Kong cultural myths and values have been shaken to the core. Political and socio-economic reforms also repeatedly failed in the hands of Hong Kong’s default operational logic, and structural injustices remain unresolved. Popular Hong Kong films released in 2010 seem to converge in collective soul searching through shifts in the representations of mainstream masculinity and local identity politics. The gender and cultural sensitivity of the generation coming of age in this millennium are represented as different. Cocky boastfulness gives way to the recognition of internal inadequacies and injustices and the respect for hard-earned wisdom and mastery. This is also reflected in the overturning of film genres representative of the heyday of Hong Kong. "Once a Gangster" is an anti-gangster gangster film. "La Comédie Humaine" is an anti-heoric killer film. "Gallants" is a tribute to unsung kungfu <b>masters</b> past their <b>prime</b> and "Break Up Club" is about {{a very different kind of}} mainstream boyfriend.
