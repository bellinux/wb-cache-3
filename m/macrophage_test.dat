40|$|In seven {{patients}} with chronic beryllium disease (Be) the Be lymphocyte transformation test was positive in 100 %, independent of steroid therapy, and was reproducible. The Be macrophage migration inhibition test was only positive in four of seven patients (57 %) not on steroids, and was not reproducible. In 72 potentially exposed healthy beryllium workers the lymphocyte transformation test was negative in all subjects. The <b>macrophage</b> <b>test</b> was positive in four of 78 and again the results were not reproducible. The workers with positive results showed no differences in age, type or duration of employment from those with negative results and showed no evidence of disease. In addition, the <b>macrophage</b> <b>test</b> was positive in two of 45 non-exposed control subjects. We also confirmed the above advantages of the lymphocyte transformation technique by using tuberculin antigen (PPD). The PPD lymphocyte transformation test gave positive results in approximately 60 % of healthy beryllium workers, but the PPD <b>macrophage</b> <b>test</b> was only positive in 7 %. We conclude that the Be lymphocyte transformation test is the most sensitive and reproducible and advocate its use in the diagnosis of disease and in monitoring the health of potentially exposed workers...|$|E
40|$|Levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and Bay Y 3118 are new fluoroquinolones with {{variable}} in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). The potential therapeutic activities of these agents both alone and combined with ethambutol were evaluated {{in a human}} <b>macrophage</b> <b>test</b> system and in the beige mouse animal test system with MAC strain 101. Bay Y 3118 at a human-equivalent dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks caused {{a significant reduction in}} mortality compared with that in untreated controls (P = 0. 02). Bay Y 3118 also caused significant reductions in the number of MAC organisms in the blood, liver tissue, and spleen tissue compared with those in untreated controls. Levofloxacin at a human-equivalent dose of 200 mg/kg/day was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (10 versus 39 %); however, treatment with either levofloxacin or ofloxacin (200 mg/kg/day) did not result in significant reductions in the numbers of MAC organisms in blood, liver, and spleen compared with those in untreated controls. When Bay Y 3118 was combined with ethambutol, there was no enhancement in therapeutic activity except in the spleen in terms of CFU per gram (reductions of 89 % compared with the untreated control, 63 % compared with Bay Y 3118 alone, and 72. 5 % compared with ethambutol alone). Levofloxacin in combination with ethambutol was more active than either drug alone in the reduction of organisms in blood, liver, and spleen. Bay Y 3118 was the most active fluoroquinolone for monotherapy of MAC infection in beige mice, and the combination of ethambutol plus either levofloxacin or ofloxacin was at least additive. In summary, this study demonstrates that quinolones, although active, are inhibitory against MAC in vivo and that there is little correlation between the activity of quinolones in vitro and the activity in mice...|$|E

40|$|Aphidicolin and {{a series}} of semisynthetic aphidicolan {{derivatives}} have been identified in in vitro tests as novel drugs with antiparasitic potential. All compounds have been tested against extracellular promastigotes of Leishmania donovani, L. infantum, L. enriettii, and L. major and against intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani in murine macrophages. The compounds showed antileishmanial activity at concentrations in the microgram range (50 % effective concentration [EC 50] = 0. 02 to 1. 83 μg/ml). The most active derivative (aphidicolin- 17 -glycinate hydrochloride) had EC 50 s of 0. 2 μg/ml against extracellular and 0. 02 μg/ml against intracellular L. donovani parasites. To validate the pharmacological potential of tested drugs, pharmacological safety was determined by testing all compounds against two neoplastic cell lines (squamous carcinoma [KB] and melanoma [SK-Mel]) and against murine bone marrow-derived macrophages as host cells. With minor exceptions only for <b>macrophages,</b> <b>tested</b> aphidicolans did not show significant cytotoxicity (EC 50 > 25. 0 μg/ml).

40|$|Earlier work {{demonstrated}} that the transcription factor C/EBPα can convert immature and mature murine B lineage cells into functional <b>macrophages.</b> <b>Testing</b> > 20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPα is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBPαER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. The converted cells retained their phenotype even when C/EBPα was inactivated, a hallmark of cell reprogramming. Interestingly, C/EBPα induction also impaired the cells’ tumorigenicity. Likewise, C/EBPα efficiently converted a lymphoblastic leukemia B cell line into macrophage-like cells, again dramatically impairing their tumorigenicity. Our experiments show that human cancer cells can be induced by C/EBPα to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high frequencies and provide a proof of principle for a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating B cell malignancies...|$|R

To evaluate one of the possible causes of increased susceptibility to infections in the elderly, peripheral neutrophil and monocyte counts, neutrophil and monocyte chemiluminescence (ChL), <b>macrophage</b> precursor <b>test</b> and production of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) of peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs) were examined. The neutrophil and monocyte counts in the peripheral blood were not different between the elderly (≧ 70 years old) and the younger (< 70 years old) groups. In the neutrophil ChL assay, the base lines, peak levels and peak times were not different between the elderly and the younger groups. In the monocyte ChL assay, the peak level in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the younger group (p< 0. 05). The values in a <b>macrophage</b> precursor <b>test</b> in the eldely group were signicantly lower {{than those in the}} younger group (P< 0. 05). CSF production of PMNCs in the eldely was significantly lower than that in the younger group(P< 0. 05).

40|$|When lymphocyte-macrophage {{suspensions}} from sensitized {{animals are}} preincubated with specific antigen for 24 or more h, the following results are observed. (i) In a standard capillary <b>macrophage</b> migration <b>test,</b> there is complete inhibition of migration. (ii) When the preincubated cell suspension is mixed in varying proportions {{with a similar}} suspension from nonsensitized animals and a <b>macrophage</b> migration <b>test</b> is performed, there is no linear relationship between the degree of inhibition of migration {{and the proportion of}} sensitized lymphocytes initially present. Inhibition thus appears to be an “all-or-none” effect. (iii) In spite of the second observation, increasing periods of preincubation with antigen result in increasing inhibition. (iv) These results suggest the existence of a complex amplifying mechanism operating within the early period of exposure to antigen. (v) To test the possibility that cell proliferation contributes to this amplification, cells from sensitized guinea pigs were irradiated with a dose of 1, 000 rads prior to preincubation with antigen. Despite this dose, which virtually abolishes cell division in other systems, no diminution whatever in the amplification of inhibition was observed. These results suggest the existence of an early phase of increased production of migratory inhibition factor that is not dependent on cell division but that may be related to “recruitment” of nonsensitized lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Adult bone marrow-derived {{cells can}} {{participate}} in muscle regeneration after bone marrow transplantation. In recent studies a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) was shown to give rise to cells that not only reconstituted all of the lineages of the blood, but also contributed to mature muscle fibers. However, the relevant HSC derivative with this potential {{has not yet been}} definitively identified. Here we use fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based protocols to test distinct hematopoietic fractions and show that only fractions containing c-kit+ immature myelomonocytic precursors are capable of contributing to muscle fibers after i. m. injection. Although these cells belong to the myeloid lineage, they do not include mature CD 11 b+ myelomonocytic cells, such as macrophages. Of the four sources of mature <b>macrophages</b> <b>tested</b> that were derived either from monocytic culture, bone marrow, peripheral blood after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization, or injured muscle, none contributed to muscle. In addition, after transplantation of bone marrow isolated from CD 11 b-Cre-transgenic mice into the Cre-reporter strain (Z/EG), no GFP myofibers were detected, demonstrating that macrophages expressing CD 11 b do not fuse with myofibers. Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, these data suggest that the HSC derivatives that integrate into regenerating muscle fibers exist in the pool of hematopoietic cells known as myelomonocytic progenitors...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the major infiltrating phagocytes during leptospirosis {{and examine the}} killing mechanism used by the host to eliminate Leptospira interrogans. Major infiltrating phagocytes in Leptospira-infected C 3 H/HeJ mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. Chemokines and vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules (VECAMs) of Leptospira-infected mice and leptospirosis patients were detected by microarray and immunohistochemistry. Leptospira-phagocytosing and -killing abilities of human or mouse macrophages and neutrophils, and the roles of intracellular ROS, NO and [Ca 2 +]i in Leptospira-killing process were evaluated by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorimetry. Peripheral blood mononuclear-macrophages rather than neutrophils were the main infiltrating phagocytes in the lungs, liver and kidneys of infected mice. Levels of macrophage- but not neutrophil-specific chemokines and VECAMs were significantly increased in the samples from infected mice and patients. All <b>macrophages</b> <b>tested</b> had a higher ability than neutrophils to phagocytose and kill leptospires. Higher ROS and NO levels and [Ca 2 +]i in the macrophages were involved in killing leptospires. Human macrophages displayed more phagolysosome formation and a stronger leptospire-killing ability to than mouse macrophages. Mononuclear-macrophages but not neutrophils represent the main infiltrating and anti-leptospiral phagocytes during leptospirosis.

40|$|Legionella pneumophila {{infection}} of macrophages from permissive guinea pigs and from A/J mice compared with {{infection of}} cells from nonpermissive BDF 1 mice was studied by electron microscopy. The {{cells from the}} BDF 1 mice were nonpermissive for legionella growth in vitro and showed few if any bacteria in phagosomes by electron microscopic examination. Similar electron micrographic examination of macrophages from A/J mice permissive for legionella growth showed numerous intact intracellular bacteria within 24 to 48 h of culture and the transition of intracellular bacteria from localization in a few large vacuoles early {{in the course of}} infection to later localization in areas surrounded and studded by ribosomes. These electron microscopic observations were similar to those seen in the case of guinea pig macrophages infected with legionellae. Biochemical studies of macrophages from permissive versus nonpermissive animals showed little or no differences in respiratory burst and lysosomal enzyme activity for macrophages from all animals tested. However, when zymosan was used as a stimulant, macrophages from the nonpermissive mouse strain produced a larger amount of H 2 O 2 and O 2 - than did cells from permissive guinea pigs or A/J mice. However, legionella vaccine itself induced no detectable or very little H 2 O 2 and O 2 - in <b>macrophages</b> <b>tested</b> from any source. These results suggest that permissiveness of A/J mouse macrophages to legionella growth may involve mechanisms similar to those occurring in guinea pig macrophages in terms of morphologic and possibly even biochemical events.
