25|$|<b>Moxidectin</b> {{has been}} {{released}} in the United States as part of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + <b>moxidectin)</b> topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes <b>moxidectin</b> for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms.|$|E
25|$|Antigen testing, in most practices, has supplanted or {{supplemented}} microfilarial detection. Combining the microfilaria {{and adult}} antigen test is most useful in dogs receiving diethylcarbamazine or no preventative (as macrolides as for example ivermectin or <b>moxidectin</b> typically render the dog amicrofilaremic). Up to 1% of infected dogs are microfilaria-positive and antigen-negative.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxidectin</b> {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as a treatment}} for scabies. It is established in veterinary medicine to treat a range of parasites, including sarcoptic mange. Its advantage over ivermectin is its longer half life in humans and, thus, potential duration of action. Tea tree oil appears to be effective in a Petri dish.|$|E
25|$|Although lipid rescue {{mechanism}} of action is not completely understood, the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink, allowing {{for the removal of}} lipophilic toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with <b>moxidectin</b> toxicosis.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, <b>Moxidectin,</b> Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of {{heartworm}} infection can {{be obtained}} {{through a number of}} veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names Heartgard, Iverhart, and several other generic versions), milbemycin (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and Sentinel Flavor Tabs) and <b>moxidectin</b> (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. <b>Moxidectin</b> is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. [...] The injectable form of <b>moxidectin</b> was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the FDA returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, ProHeart 12, is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. [...] Topical treatments are available, as well. [...] Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + <b>moxidectin)</b> Topical Solution, uses <b>moxidectin</b> for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms, as well as imidacloprid to kill adult fleas. [...] Selamectin (Revolution) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly; it also controls fleas, ticks, and mites.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs used in {{treatment}} of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, <b>moxidectin,</b> diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, [...] and ivermectin.|$|E
2500|$|Heartworm {{prevention}} for cats {{is available}} as ivermectin (Heartgard for Cats), [...] milbemycin (Interceptor), or the topical selamectin (Revolution for Cats) and Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + <b>moxidectin)</b> topical solution.|$|E
2500|$|Infections with Trypanosoma {{species are}} treated, either prophylactically or to treat acute cases with {{synthetic}} chemical {{drugs such as}} diminazine. Infections with nematode worms causing filariosis may be treated with the avermectin class of biologically derived drugs (macrocyclic lactones) such as ivermectin, doramectin, <b>moxidectin.</b> There are commercially available vaccines to protect animals against bluetongue, and African horse sickness ...|$|E
2500|$|Another way of combating drug {{resistance}} in adult horses is to deworm less frequently, by performing fecal egg counts on manure and deworming only horses {{with a high}} count. This strategy is now recommended by most veterinarians and parasitologists, as it reduces the probability of resistance. For horses that are consistently deemed [...] "low shedders," [...] it is still recommended to deworm at least 1-2 times per year with ivermectin + praziquantel or <b>moxidectin</b> + praziquantel to target tapeworms, bots, and small strongyles. This is typically done {{in the fall and}} spring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moxidectin</b> {{has been}} {{released}} in the United States as part of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + <b>moxidectin)</b> topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes <b>moxidectin</b> for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moxidectin</b> is very lipophilic, {{which causes}} {{it to have}} a high volume of distribution. <b>Moxidectin</b> {{concentrates}} in the animal's adipose tissue, from where it is released for up to two months following administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moxidectin</b> is an {{anthelmintic}} drug used {{in animals}} {{to prevent or}} control parasitic worms (helminths), such as heartworm and intestinal worms, in dogs, cats, horses, cattle and sheep. <b>Moxidectin</b> kills {{some of the most}} common internal and external parasites by selectively binding to a parasite's glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells; when <b>moxidectin</b> binds to the channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite.|$|E
5000|$|If a dog licks <b>moxidectin</b> {{from the}} skin which was applied as a [...] "spot-on" [...] (topical) treatment, this has the same effect as an overdose, and may cause vomiting, salivation and {{neurological}} signs such as ataxia, tremor, and nystagmus. Collie dogs can be administered <b>moxidectin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, an American Cyanamid Company agronomist {{discovered}} the Streptomyces bacteria from which <b>moxidectin</b> is derived in a soil sample from Australia.Two companies filed patents for moxidectin: Glaxo Group and the American Cyanamid Company; in 1988, all patents {{were transferred to}} American Cyanamid. In 1990, the first <b>moxidectin</b> product was sold in Argentina.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis is made {{by finding}} the adult worms in the eye or {{surrounding}} tissues. Human cases are treated by simply removing the worms. In canines, topical imidacloprid with <b>moxidectin,</b> or milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) have been recommended.|$|E
50|$|Main rival {{products}} for dogs include ivermectin (trade names Stromectol, Ivermec and others) or milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) for heartworms, Advocate from Bayer (Imidacloprid and <b>moxidectin),</b> fipronil (Frontline) or lufenuron (Program) for fleas, or the combination milbemycin oxime/lufenuron (Sentinel) for both.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} 2501 people in Ghana showed the {{prevalence}} rate doubled between 2000 and 2005 despite treatment, suggesting the parasite is developing {{resistance to the}} drug. A clinical trial of another antiparasitic agent, <b>moxidectin</b> (manufactured by Wyeth), began on July 1, 2009 (NCT00790998).|$|E
50|$|An {{overdose}} of <b>moxidectin</b> enhances {{the effect of}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In horses, overdose may lead to depression, drooping of the lower lip, tremor, lack of coordination when moving (ataxia), decreased rate of breathing (respiratory rate), stupor and coma.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{treatment}} of livestock, {{dogs and cats}} with organophosphates (such as ecothiopate iodide or isofluorophate) and systemic treatment with anthelmintics (such as ivermectin, levamisole, and doramectin) are recommended by the Merck Veterinary Manual. Other sources have reported positive results treating dogs with <b>moxidectin,</b> imidacloprid, or milbemycin oxime.|$|E
50|$|In studies, <b>moxidectin</b> {{has shown}} some successes in the {{treatment}} of onchocerciasis (river-blindness) in humans, by showing substantial reduction of microfilarial loads, or 'bumps', associated with extreme itching and migration of larvae in the late stage. The switch from ivermectin use would reduce the chances of the helminth larvae from developing immunity.|$|E
50|$|Dewormers {{that have}} {{ivermectin}} or <b>moxidectin</b> {{are the most}} effective against these parasites. Treating a horse with regular dewormer when they have the worms inside of them may cause the worms to migrate all at once, causing rupture of the intestines and lead to death. A deworming schedule should be discussed with a veterinarian.|$|E
