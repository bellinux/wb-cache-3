Vertical {{transmission}} of baculovirus naturally occurs in lepidopteran populations, {{and has been}} proposed as a strategy for virus survival during periods of host scarcity or for improving virus dispersal. Previous studies established that the nucleopolyhedrovirus of Spodoptera exigua (SeMNPV) is vertically transmitted in field caught adult moths from Almerian (Spain). Unexpectedly, field caught gravid females were observed to produce virus infected offspring even though no evidence of the infection was seen in these females. This led us to suspect that both sexes may contribute to vertical {{transmission of}} the pathogen. To examine this hypothesis {{we set up a}} <b>mating</b> <b>schedule</b> involving four groups: i) virus free males × virus free females; ii) infected males × infected females; iii) virus free males × infected females; and iv) infected males × virus free females. The offspring from each treatment were individually reared through to adults and then analyzed by qPCR. We will present the results of thisexperiment and show gender specific differences in the capacity to transmit SeMNPV to the offspring. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The hog deer (Axis porcinus) {{is a small}} deer whose {{natural habitat}} is the wet or moist tall grasslands in South and Southeast Asia. Wild populations have {{dramatically}} decreased in recent decades. While wild hog deer were recently acknowledged to be extinct in China, a few captive populations have been maintained. In the present study, we successfully employed the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technique to generate a genome-wide profile of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the captive population of hog deer from Chengdu Zoo, China (N = 11). Up to 4. 7 million clean reads per sample were sequenced, and 11, 155 SNPs and 8, 247 haplotypes were simultaneously observed within more than 80 % of sequenced individuals. In this population, the mean frequency of major alleles at each polymorphism site was 0. 7903 ± 0. 0014, and the average nucleotide diversity (π) and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) were 0. 3031 ± 0. 0015 and - 0. 0302 ± 0. 0062, respectively. Additionally, the Euclidean distance-based multidimensional scaling method revealed that the pairwise genetic relatedness was evenly distributed. However, the results of homologous searching by short reads did not provide any meaningful explanation of the phylogenetic relationship of hog deer, which should be further investigated. In conclusion, our results revealed current state of genetic diversity in this captive population of hog deer. Furthermore, these genome-wide SNPs would be useful for guiding the <b>mating</b> <b>schedule</b> to avoid sharp increase of inbreeding coefficient...|$|E
5|$|Ten of the {{seventeen}} {{species of}} UK bat are {{found on the}} property, eight within {{the structure of the}} house alone. Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and greater horseshoe bat. Maintenance work is timed to fit in with hibernating and <b>mating</b> <b>schedules,</b> and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors may see some of the property's bats on a closed-circuit television system.|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Jani Hurula {{described}} it as [...] "majestic and humongous" [...] and also said the album songs [...] "are more concentrated and have more meat around them, ... Just the way we like them. The production was also exactly what each of us {{wanted it to be}} this time around." [...] The title of the album, according to him, fits the band [...] "perfectly[...]. The underdogs are back with a vengeance!". Hurula also said the band is going to shoot a video for the album and they are also willing to tour, but he gave no further details. Liimatainen also expressed his wish to tour and shoot a video, but he depends on his band <b>mates</b> <b>schedules.</b>|$|R
40|$|Eye colour of Triatoma infestans is {{controlled}} {{at a single}} autosomal locus, with black-eye as the dominant gene and red-eye as the recessive. Inheritance of these characters follows a classical Mendelian system, enabling eye colour {{to be used as}} a marker for studies of mating frequency. We found no significant differences in oviposition rates and egg hatching rates irrespective of parental phenotypes. Different <b>mating</b> <b>schedules</b> between red-eye and black-eye parents showed that eye colour did not affect mating competence. Females mated with a single male or with different males together or in succession produced similar numbers of fertile eggs, with the eye colour of the offspring reflecting exposure to the different males. We conclude that although a single mating can provide sufficient sperm for the whole reproductive life of the female, multiple matings can result in balanced assortative sperm usage from the spermatheca...|$|R
50|$|H. rubicundus’s annual colony {{cycle is}} {{dependent}} both on hibernation and <b>mating</b> <b>schedules.</b> After hibernation during the winter, female foundresses who mated the previous cycle {{emerge in the}} spring. They each create their own nests in late spring, where they rear a single brood. Females {{are more likely to}} build nests where there is a warmer surface temperature, as this indicates a warmer interior of the nest for the offspring to develop more quickly. The worker bees provide pollen as food to the larvae. The gyne will continue to forage for 3-5 weeks, after which she will stop provisioning food to the brood cell. The brood cells are left inactive for 1-2 weeks before the emergence of the first brood. The first brood emerges in mid to late June. Most females emerging from the first brood will stay with their natal nest and act as foraging workers.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{a litter}} of Papillon puppies whom Show split up to be sold between his and Teppei's stores. One of his litter <b>mates</b> was <b>scheduled</b> to shoot a {{commercial}} with Yamashita but Lucky replaced it after his sibling's ears began to droop undesirably. With training done on set by both Yamashita and Suguri (who suggested calling the dog Lucky so it would train better) Lucky succeeded in filming the commercial with only moderate difficulty. Afterwards, Show attempted to purchase Lucky {{with the intent of}} turning him into an advertising mascot until Yamashita arrived to adopt Lucky for herself. He's every close to his owner. However he wants all her attention to himself.|$|R
50|$|For 1934, both Chrysler and its junior running <b>mate,</b> DeSoto, were <b>scheduled</b> {{to offer}} the Airflow. DeSoto was {{assigned}} to offer nothing but Airflows; Chrysler, however, hedged its bets and continued to offer a six-cylinder variant of its more mainstream 1933 model cars. The Airflow used a flathead I8 engine and was produced in both 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan variants. It is believed that only three 1934 Imperial Airflows still exist.|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that males make a nutrient investment during copulation. This idea agrees with the sexual selection theory, which predicts that females would act in ways to maximize the nutrient material they receive and predicts that males would act in ways to maximize the return on their investments. Studies support this theory by showing that younger males (males with less wing wear) are more successful in courtship than older males, males accepted by females are significantly less variable in size than males rejected by females, persistence increases a male's chance of copulating up to a point, and the size of females accepted by males is less variable than that of rejected females. The amount of protein in a male's spermatophore is negatively correlated with age because it is more likely for older males to have mated previously. Females therefore prefer younger mates perhaps to secure large ejaculates, as smaller males and males that have mated previously produce smaller ejaculates. [...] The brightness of ultraviolet reflectance and pheromone descriptors, both important factors in mate selection, are also negatively correlated with age. However, variation between these two traits (visual and olfactory) is mostly uncorrelated. Since ultraviolet brightness emerges as the best predictor of male mating success, female preferences for brighter males may also indicate its relation to a material benefit. In addition, studies have shown a longevity difference between virgin and mated females, suggesting a cost to mating. It is hypothesized that there is a toxic side effect of the male ejaculate. However, it is still unclear how this longevity cost influences the evolution of lifetime <b>mating</b> <b>schedules.</b> The supposed cost also does not affect the number of eggs a female lays in its lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Activity rhythms in 24 h light-dark cycles, {{constant}} darkness, {{and constant}} light conditions were analyzed in four different Nasonia species for each sex separately. Besides similarities, clear differences are evident among and within Nasonia species {{as well as}} between sexes. In all species, activity in a light-dark cycle is concentrated in the photophase, typical for diurnal organisms. Contrary to most diurnal insect species so far studied, Nasonia follows Aschoff’s rule by displaying long (. 24 h) internal rhythms in constant darkness but short (, 24 h) in constant light. In constant light, N. vitripennis males display robust circadian activity rhythms, whereas females are usually arrhythmic. In contrast to other Nasonia species, N. longicornis males display anticipatory activity, i. e. activity shortly before light-on in a light-dark cycle. As expected, N. oneida shows activity patterns similar to those of N. giraulti but with important differences in key circadian parameters. Differences in circadian activity patterns and parameters between species may reflect synchronization of specific life-history traits to environmental conditions. <b>Scheduling</b> <b>mating</b> or dispersion to a specific time of the day could be a strategy to avoid interspecific hybridization in Nasonia species that live in sympatry...|$|R
