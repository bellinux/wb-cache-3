As far as the game system had come, it was clear that much of the foundation on which it was resting had to be redone and/or reorganized. In fact, GI: Anvil of Victory had already reached a point where most of the counters from the original Squad Leader game had been made obsolete, as German, British, French and American infantry counters were redone (with controversial [...] "static" [...] artwork depicting soldiers at rest rather than in action poses) with new information for smoke-making capability, and special weapons and morale characteristics (these characteristics would carry over to Advanced Squad Leader.) ...|$|E
50|$|Transparent {{information}} about the terms and conditions associated with the product or service can facilitate a plenty of regulatory requirements to redress the consumer related grievances. Primarily, complete information will level the information asymmetries, improve consumer's decision- <b>making</b> <b>capability</b> vis-à-vis the seller's complex knowledge about the product they are selling.Consumer information also harmonises and solve consumer problems, create awareness and guide their behaviour. Another important objective that is achieved by informing the consumer is impact on Competitive policy. This will enable the traders and service providers to give greater information to consumers about their product, educate them about the product quality and other specifications.In addition to the compliance to the legal obligations, the business firms also have their planned, tactical and important business- related reasons behind informing the consumer. The business organisation ensure consumer's expectation management by equipping them with certain knowledge about the commodity.Many times, business face disincentive by providing information to the consumers, as it might harm the marketability and attractiveness of their product. This indicate the power gained on being an Informed consumer.The economic analysis indicates that information asymmetry to consumer is a major ground for market failure, causing the consumer to make irrational decisions. Thus, unbiased information can solve the market problems by equipping the customers with appropriate information and thereby ensuring healthy market practices.|$|E

We discuss several issues that agents need to deliberate about in order to decide which action to perform.

The deliberation process is investigated from two perspectives. From the agent specification point of view the deliberation process can be specified by dynamic properties such as commitment strategies, and from the agent programming point of view the deliberation process should be implemented through the deliberation cycle of the agent, which can be either fixed or determined by a deliberation programming language...|$|E
