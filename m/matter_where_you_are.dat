During a review of Saxobeats, Celeste Rhoads from AllMusic saw [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] as a club sensation along with [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] (2009) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Rodrigo of Yam Magazine wrote, [...] "One day, I heard Mr. Saxobeat by accident and I was instantly hooked. Thanks to its insanely catchy saxophone riffs and Stan's voice, Mr. Saxobeat is a very fun, upbeat song that you can smile and dance to no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Plus, the song works like a charm for parties." [...] McCall of The Star-Ledger associated the song with {{the revival of the}} saxophone in music. The Hollywood Reporter Shirley Halperin listed the saxophone sequences in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] in her list of [...] "12 Awesome Sax Solos". Johnston, writing for Village Voice, said [...] "the way they're employed" [...] sounded like Pitbull's [...] "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)" [...] (2009). In his book Stars of 21st Century Dance Pop and EDM: 33 DJs, Producers and Singers ... author James Arena listed it in his [...] "range of sounds that make up the world of the twenty-first century dance music".

500|$|The heavy metal-inspired {{world of}} Brütal Legend was also well received, and {{considered}} {{to show a}} clear reverence for the genre. [...] Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be [...] "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" [...] and [...] "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements {{that made up the}} heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being [...] "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" [...] at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game {{may not be the most}} sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in the world, there's always some cool object to look at", while Donlan considered the world to be a [...] "constant unfolding delight". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have [...] "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of [...] "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation." ...|$|E

Mugison was so fascinated by Kjartan's mysterious presence, most notably his hair, that he sought him out and requested the musician teach Mugison how to become an artist. Kjartan agreed and they met every Wednesday in order for him to impart his widom and expose Mugison {{to all kinds of}} weird and wonderful music and literature including Frank Zappa, The Beat Poets and key Icelandic poetry. He told Mugison that this knowledge was crucial, as it could lend itself to conversations all over the world, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> from or <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> Another aspect of the teacher/pupil scenario included a field trip on how to look at women, an invaluable lesson.

50|$|If the {{customers}} {{do not find}} value and integrity in the products they are buying they will be quick {{to leave for the}} next lowest price. Selling on pure price turns the product into a commodity. Commoditization does more harm than good for the brand or company selling. A commodity is something for which there is demand, but which is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. It is a product that is the same no matter who produces it, such as petroleum, notebook paper, or milk. In other words, copper is copper. Rice is rice. These kinds of items have a set price no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> buy. Commodities <b>are</b> and should be sold predominantly upon their price.|$|R

Junior high school students demonstrate deficits in different domains of foreign language learning, {{most of which are}} the result of teachers’ lack of knowledge and skills. A bulk of studies has dealt with different skills and knowledge of language teachers. However, existing studies have rarely made any comparisons between school and language institute teachers. Therefore, in this study, using Brown's (2001) checklist of good language teaching characteristics, and the teacher self-observation form (Christison & Bassano, 1984), teachers’ skills and knowledge of language in these contexts were evaluated. Language institute teachers were found to have higher levels of knowledge and skills as compared to school teachers. The findings have implications for language teachers, syllabus and curriculum designers, and in-service teacher training programs...|$|R

When looking at the experiences in Latin America we of course can not “copy ” what is done there. Farming is always site specific, but the principles of using cover crops are valid all over the world. The experiences from Latin America are especially interesting for no-till farmers, because they have {{played a key role in}} further developing and perfecting the no-tillage system. We should be aware that some cover crop species adapt to a very wide range of climatic and soil conditions. Several cover crop species used in South America are well adapted to the conditions of northern United States. We should also be aware that “no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> farm, there <b>are</b> cover crop species that meet your needs ” (USDA-ARS, 2002). While the US has the biggest area under no-tillage worldwide (about 22. 4 million ha), the quality of this technology is often far from being satisfactory.

We are online 24 h of our time, we share our thoughts, pictures or videos on Facebook, twitter, or other social networks. We look for jobs through LinkedIn through the screen of our smartphone. We can watch TV-series’ episodes on our smartphones without downloading the file, just by streaming {{the data from the}} cloud. We can book flights, restaurants, hotels, everything through the Internet on our smartphone. If we get lost on the road, we can use our smartphone to guide us back home or to take us to our destination. Few years ago, in the 1980 s, this was not like this. Few years ago, you could not read the news anywhere other than in a newspaper, you could not book flights or hotels unless you went to a travel agency and if you wanted to keep track and not miss any meetings or birthdays, you had to write everything on an agenda (and check it every day to know what you had to do). Even when the Internet became mainstream and available to the majority of society, <b>you</b> had to <b>be</b> {{in front of a computer}} to do some of this things. So, what happened in order for us to be able to do all this things mentioned before, on the go, virtually anywhere?
