We in-cluded predominantly multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) isolates, since the activity of MEM-CLA for resistant isolates has previously not been studied extensively. UsingMiddlebrook 7 H 10 medium, all but four isolates showed anMIC distribution of 0. 125 to 2 mg/liter for MEM-CLA, below the non-species-related breakpoint for MEM of 2 mg/ liter defined by EUCAST. MEM-CLA is a potential treatment option for MDR/XDR-TB. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculo-sis (MDR/XDR-TB) is unrelentingly increasing worldwide.

The β-lactam pharmacokinetic parameters can be altered in severe sepsis due {{to changes in the}} distribution, the metabolism and the elimination process. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of β-lactams is therefore recommended in critically ill patients. The plasma samples were spiked with cefoperazone as internal standard and proteins were precipitated with methanol. The different β-lactams were separated with high performance liquid chromatography within 18 min, and quantified by UV spectrophotometry with a diode array detector. The method was validated by means of the accuracy profile approach based on β expectation tolerance intervals. The acceptance limits were settled at ± 30 % according to the regulatory requirements. Assay validation demonstrated good performance for all β-lactams analyzed in terms of trueness, repeatability, linearity and intermediate precision over the range of 2 - 200 μg/mL. The simple extraction procedure provides respective absolute and relative recoveries ranging from 70 % to 86 % and from 66 % to 89 % for all the β-lactams analyzed. Few interferences were observed and the method was easily applicable to TDM in intensive care patients. The quantification of β-lactams should allow for antibiotic regimen adjustment in critically ill patients. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Cross-S analysis of CLSI MICs compared IPM, MEM, and ertapenem (ETP) to DOR for 7 groups of recent isolates: staphylococci (STAPH; S. aureus [SA] and oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 6304), enterococci (ESP; 3491 including 2253 E. faecalis [EF]), Enterobacteriaceae (ENT; 6560), P. aeruginosa (PSA; 1494), Acinetobacter spp. (ACB; 600), H. influenzae (HI; 109), and S. pneumoniae (SPN; 750). Target accuracy was ≥ 90 % categorical agreement and ≤ 1. 5 % false-S (very major; VM) error. Candidate DOR break points were those published for other CARBs. Results: Per CLSI interpretive guidelines, oxacillin (OXA) is the b-lactam surrogate for STAPH and ampicillin (AMP) for IPM to predict ESP-S.

Forty-three wild-type (WT) strains, 42 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 18 ESBL producers with outer membrane porin protein loss (ESBL/Omp strains), and 42 blaKPC-possessing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) isolates were evaluated. Imipenem (IPM), <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> ertapenem (ERT), and doripenem (DOR) were tested by broth microdilution (BMD), Etest, and disk diffusion (DD), and the modified Hodge test (MHT) was performed using IPM and MEM disks. Results were interpreted according to original as well as recently updated interpretative criteria. MHT was positive for all 42 KPC-Kp isolates and 10 of 18 ESBL/Omp strains and therefore had poor specificity in differentiating between KPC-Kp and ESBL/Omp isolates. Based on the updated CLSI standards, phenotypic susceptibility testing by BMD and DD differentiated most carbapenem-susceptible from carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae isolates {{without the need for}} MHT, while the Etest method characterized many KPC-Kp isolates as susceptible, and breakpoints may need to be lowered for this method. However, both the original and updated CLSI criteria do not adequately differentiate between isolates in the KPC-Kp group, which are unlikely to respond to carbapenem therapy, and those in the ESBL/Omp group, which are likely to respond to carbapenem therapy if MICs are within pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets.

Nineteen critically-ill patients with KPC-Kp BSI were given combination therapy including MEM, tigecycline, plus colistin or gentamicin (according to susceptibility testing). MEM was administered as an extended 3 -hour infusion of 2  g every 8  hours, or adjusted according to renal function. MEM plasma concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. PK/PD targets for MEM were defined as T> 40 % 1 ×MIC and T> 40 % 4 ×MIC. Possible synergisms between MEM and coadministered agents were assessed by time-kill assays based on plasma levels for MEM and on fixed plasma concentrations for the other agents. In none of 19 patients MEM reached any PK/PD target. The actual MEM MICs were 256, 512, and 1024  mg/L in 1, 3, and 15 isolates, respectively. However, theoretically, the PK/PD target of T> 40 % 1 ×MIC could have been achieved in 95 %, 68 %, 32 % and 0 % of the isolates for MIC equal to 8, 16, 32, and 64  mg/L, respectively. No synergisms were observed between MEM and coadministered agents. In conclusion, high-dose MEM failed to reach PK/PD targets in 19 patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp with very high MEM MICs.

30|$|Outbreaks of CPE, {{primarily}} Klebsiella pneumoniae, {{have been}} reported in the USA since the beginning of the 2000 s and recently in several other regions worldwide. These isolates are resistant to all carbapenems and susceptible only to colistin and gentamicin. At the same time, sporadic isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM)</b> but sensitive to imipenem (IPM) emerged (Nordman et al. 2012). Given the limited therapeutic options available, the accurate and timely detection of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae is vital in order to control their spread (Nordmann et al. 2009). The aim of our study is to evaluate the incidence of intestinal colonization with CPE in non-hospitalized patients and to assess a microbiological protocol for screening these isolates in fecal material. In this study, 600 fecal samples were collected, 450 of them from out patients clinics (group I) and 150 from different hospital departments (group II). Among these isolates, 12 patients (2 %) had reduced susceptibility to one or more carbapenems and positive Chromagar KPC and or positive Modified Hodge Test, 2 (0.3 %) of them were non hospitalized (group I|) while 10 (1.7 %) were hospitalized (group II). The frequency of CPE fecal colonization in our study is higher than the clinical prevalence in Spanish hospitals (1.1 %) although it is still lower than that reported in another study as in hospitalized patients in France during a non-outbreak period CPE was (5.3 %) (Miro and et al. 2010) Out of the 600 fecal samples, 12 were positive by both Chrome culture and PCR. 11 of them were typical K. pneumoniae showing mucoid metallic blue colonies on Chromagar KPC and one isolate was E.coli with dark pink colonies.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the outer membrane protein OprD 2 and carbapenem-resistance in 141 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected between January and December 2013 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in China. Agar dilution methods were employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM)</b> and imipenem (IMP) for P. aeruginosa. The gene encoding OprD 2 was amplified from 141 P. aeruginosa isolates and analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Differences between the effects of IMPR and IMPS groups on the resistance of the P. aeruginosa were observed by SDS-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Three resistance types were classified in the 141 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates tested, namely IMPRMEMR (66. 7 %), IMPRMEMS (32. 6 %), and IMPRMEMS (0. 7 %). DNA sequencing revealed significant diverse gene mutations in the OprD 2 -encoding gene in these strains. Thirty-four strains had large fragment deletions in the OprD 2 gene, in 6 strains the gene contained fragment inserts, and in 96 resistant strains, the gene featured small fragment deletions or multi-site mutations. Only 4 metallo-β-lactamase strains and 1 imipenem-sensitive (meropenem-resistant) strain showed a normal OprD 2 gene. Using SDS-PAGE to detect the outer membrane protein in 16 CRPA isolates, it was found that 10 IMPRMEMR strains and 5 IMPRMEMS strains had lost the OprD 2 protein, while the IMPSMEMR strain contained a normal 46 -kDa protein. In conclusion, mutation or loss of the OprD 2 -encoding gene caused the loss of OprD 2, which further led to carbapenem-resistance of P. aeruginosa.

The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 μl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the β-lactams imipenem (IPM), <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1 : 320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1 : 320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities.

A total of 28 genetically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae strains producing several class A carbapenemases were tested. Thirty-eight genetically unrelated negative controls were included. The isolates were tested against imipenem (IPM), <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> and ertapenem (ETP) by MIC and disk diffusion assays in order to select appropriate tools to screen for suspected carbapenemase production. It was possible to differentiate class A carbapenemase-producing bacteria from non-carbapenemase-producing bacteria by using solely the routine IPM susceptibility tests. The modified Hodge test was evaluated and found to be highly sensitive, although false-positive results were documented.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During first year, we consecutively included infected, obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kgm- 2) who received <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) or cefepime/ceftazidime (CEF). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, or those hospitalized in the intensive care unit were excluded. Serum drug concentrations were measured twice during the elimination phase by high-performance liquid chromatography. We evaluated whether free or total drug concentrations were > 1 time (fT>minimal inhibition concentration (MIC)) or > 4 times (T> 4 MIC) the clinical breakpoints for Pseudomonas aeruginosa during optimal periods of time: ≥ 40 % for MEM, ≥ 50 % for TZP and ≥ 70 % for CEF. RESULTS: We included 56 patients (median BMI: 36 kgm- 2) : 14 received MEM, 31 TZP and 11 CEF. The percentage of patients who attained target fT>MIC and T> 4 MIC were 93 % and 21 % for MEM, 68 % and 19 % for TZP, and 73 % and 18 % for CEF, respectively. High creatinine clearance (107 (range: 6 - 398) ml min- 1) was the only risk factor in univariate and multivariate analyses to predict insufficient serum concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: In obese, non-critically ill patients, standard drug regimens of TZP and CEF resulted in insufficient drug concentrations to treat infections due to less susceptible bacteria. Augmented renal clearance was responsible for these low serum concentrations. New dosage regimens need to be explored in this patient population (EUDRA-CT: 2011 - 004239 - 29). © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Most adult {{patients}} receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) require antibiotic therapy, however the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactams {{have not been}} well studied in these conditions. In this study, data from all {{patients receiving}} ECMO support and <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM)</b> or piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) were reviewed. Drug concentrations were measured 2 h {{after the start of}} a 30 -min infusion and just before the subsequent dose. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) results in ECMO patients were matched with those in non-ECMO patients for (i) drug regimen, (ii) renal function, (iii) total body weight, (iv) severity of organ dysfunction and (v) age. Drug concentrations were considered adequate if they remained 4 - 8 x the clinical MIC breakpoint for Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 50 % (TZP) or 40 % (MEM) of the dosing interval. A total of 41 TDM results (27 MEM; 14 TZP) were obtained in 26 ECMO patients, with 41 matched controls. There {{were no significant differences in}} serum concentrations or pharmacokinetic parameters between ECMO and non-ECMO patients, including V-d[0. 38 (0. 27 - 0. 68) vs. 0. 46 (0. 33 - 0. 79) L/kg; P= 0. 37], half-life [2. 6 (1. 8 - 4. 4) vs. 2. 9 (1. 7 - 3. 7) h; P= 0. 96] and clearance [132 (66 - 200) vs. 141 (93 - 197) mL/min; P= 0. 52]. The proportion of insufficient (13141 vs. 12141), adequate (15141 vs. 19141) and excessive (13141 vs. 10141) drug concentrations was similar in ECM and non-ECMO patients. Achievement of target concentrations of these beta-lactams was poor in ECMO and non-ECMO patients. The influence of ECMO on MEM and TZP pharmacokinetics does not appear to be significant.

40|$|Introduction: Sepsis is {{responsible}} for important alterations in the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which is commonly used in septic patients, may further contribute to pharmacokinetic changes. Current recommendations for antibiotic doses during CRRT combine data obtained from heterogeneous patient populations in which different CRRT devices and techniques have been used. We studied whether these recommendations met optimal pharmacokinetic criteria for broad-spectrum antibiotic levels in septic shock patients undergoing CRRT. Methods: This open, prospective study enrolled consecutive patients treated with CRRT and receiving either <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), cefepime (FEP) or ceftazidime (CAZ). Serum concentrations of these antibiotics were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography from samples taken before (t = 0) and 1, 2, 5, and 6 or 12 hours (depending on the β-lactam regimen) after the administration of each antibiotic. Series of measurements were separated into those taken during the early phase (48 hours). Results: A total of 69 series of serum samples were obtained in 53 patients (MEM, n = 17; TZP, n = 16; FEP, n = 8; CAZ, n = 12). Serum concentrations remained above four times the minimal inhibitory concentration for Pseudomonas spp. for the recommended time in 81 % of patients treated with MEM, in 71 % with TZP, in 53 % with CAZ and in 0 % with FEP. Accumulation after 48 hours of treatment was significant only for MEM. Conclusions: In septic patients receiving CRRT, recommended doses of β-lactams for Pseudomonas aeruginosa are adequate for MEM but not for TZP, FEP and CAZ; for these latter drugs, higher doses and/or extended infusions {{should be used to}} optimise serum concentrations. © 2011 Seyler et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|Introduction: Severe sepsis may {{alter the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} (PKs) of B-lactams, {{and the use}} of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may further compromise them. Hypothesis: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the correlation between B-lactams clearance and CRRT intensity. Methods: We reviewed the data of all patients undergoing CRRT and treated with ceftazidime/cefepime (CEF, 2 gq 8 h), <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM,</b> 1 gq 8 h) or piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP, 4 gq 6 h) since January 2010. Serum drug concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV), twice during the elimination phase after a 30 -min intravenous drug administration. Antibiotic PKs were calculated using a one-compartment model and the percentage of time spent above four times the MIC (%T> 4 xMIC) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained. CRRT data (blood flow, dialysate and ultrafiltrate rates) were collected and CRRT intensity was calculated as (dialysate + ultrafiltrate) /weight (kgs). Results are expressed as median [ranges]. Results: A total of 73 serum levels were obtained in 50 patients (CEF = 10; MEM = 44; TZP = 19). There was considerable variability in B-lactam serum concentrations and pharmacokinetic variables. We found a weak, although significant, correlation of CRRT intensity with both B-lactams clearance (r= 0. 31, p = 0. 007) and the %T> 4 xMIC (r= - 0. 27, p = 0. 02). B-lactams clearance was increased in patients with higher CRRT intensity (45 ml/kg. h = 74. 7 [51. 3 - 131. 7] ml/min; p = 0. 02). Also, the %T > 4 xMIC significantly decreased in patients with higher CRRT intensity (p= 0. 04). Conclusions: B-lactams concentrations and clearances during CRRT are quite variable. The intensity of CRRT may influence drug levels and elimination and should be taken into account when drug regimens are prescribed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedCommunication at the 42 st SCCM Congress (19 - 23 January 2013 – San Juan, USA) ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Although β-lactams are {{considered}} to have a safe therapeutic profile, neurotoxicity has been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the association between β-lactam concentrations and neurological alterations in septic ICU patients. Methods. Retrospective study on all ICU patients who were treated with <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM),</b> piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) or ceftazidime/cefepime (CEF) and in whom at least one β-lactam trough concentration (C min) was determined. Drug levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography; C min was normalized to the clinical breakpoint of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (as determined by EUCAST) for each drug (C min /MIC). Changes in neurological status were evaluated using changes in the neurological sequential organ failure assessment score (ΔnSOFA) using the formula: ΔnSOFA = nSOFA (day of TDM) - nSOFA (ICU admission). Worsening neurological status (NWS) was defined as a ΔnSOFA ≥ 1 for an nSOFA on admission of 0 - 2. Results. We collected 262 C min in 199 patients (130 MEM, 85 TZP, 47 CEF). Median APACHE II score and GCS on admission were 17 and 15, respectively. Overall ICU mortality was 27 %. There were no differences in the occurrence of NWS between antibiotics (39 % for MEM, 32 % for TZP and 35 % for CEF). The occurrence of NWS increased with increasing C min /MIC ranges (P= 0. 008); this correlation was found for TZP (P= 0. 05) and MEM (P= 0. 01), but not for CEF. C min /MIC was an independent predictive factor for NWS (OR 1. 12 [1. 04 - 1. 20]). Conclusion. We found a correlation between high β-lactam trough concentrations and increased occurrence of neurological deterioration in septic ICU patients. Although our data cannot determine causality, monitoring of β-lactam levels should be considered when deterioration of neurological status occurs during critical illness.

40|$|Early {{studies showed}} that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are {{susceptible}} to beta-lactams when {{they are exposed to}} pH < or = 5. 5 in broth. Because S. aureus survives in the phagolysosomes of macrophages, where the pH may be acidic, we have examined the susceptibility of MRSA ATCC 33591 phagocytized by human THP- 1 macrophages to <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM)</b> and cloxacillin (CLX). Using a pharmacodynamic model assessing key pharmacological (50 % effective concentration and maximal efficacy) and microbiological (static concentration) descriptors of antibiotic activity, we show that intraphagocytic MRSA strains are as sensitive to MEM and CLX as methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA; ATCC 25923). This observation was replicated in broth if the pH was brought to 5. 5 and was confirmed with clinical strains. Electron microscopy showed that both the MRSA and the MSSA strains localized and multiplied in membrane-bounded structures (phagolysosomes) in the absence of beta-lactams. Incubation of the infected macrophages with ammonium chloride (to raise the phagolysosomal pH) made MRSA insensitive to MEM and CLX. No difference was seen in mec, mecA, mecI, mecR 1, femA, and femB expression (reversed transcription-PCR) or in PBP 2 a content (immunodetection) in MRSA grown in broth at pH 5. 5 compared with that in MRSA grown in broth at 7. 4. The level of [(14) C]benzylpenicillin binding to cell walls prepared from a non-beta-lactamase-producing MRSA clinical isolate was two times lower than that to cell walls prepared from MSSA ATCC 25923 at pH 7. 4, but the levels increased to similar values for both strains at pH 5. 5. These data suggest that the restoration of susceptibility of intraphagocytic of MRSA to MEM and CLX is due to the acidic pH prevailing in phagolysosomes and is mediated by an enhanced binding to penicillin-binding proteins...|$|E
40|$|Background: Altered {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) in obese, non-critically {{ill patients}} {{may result in}} inadequate serum ß-lactam concentrations when standard dosage regimens (SDRs) are administered. The aim of our study was to monitor and evaluate broad-spectrum ß-lactam (BSBL) concentrations in these patients when SDRs were administered. If drug levels were insufficient, dosage regimens were increased (IDRs), and drug levels were re-monitored. Methods: Prospective interventional study from October 2011 to May 2012 at Erasme hospital. We included all consecutive obese (body mass index = 30 kg/m 2) adult patients (pts) treated with a BSBL [cefepime or ceftazidime (CEF), piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), or <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM)</b> ]. Serum samples were taken during the elimination phase after a 30 minute IV infusion to estimate PK and calculate the time spent above the MIC. Serum levels were measured by HPLC. Adequate therapy: serum levels between 4 - 8 times the MIC for « difficult-to-treat (DTT) » pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa during optimal periods of time: > 70 % for CEF, > 50 % for TZP, > 40 % for MEM. Results: 38 drug levels were obtained in 29 pts treated with SDRs. Median BMI was 35 kg/m 2, and creatinine clearance 91. 5 ml/min. 29 / 38 (3 / 5 CEF, 10 / 11 MEM, 16 / 22 TZP) drug levels were insufficient to treat “DTT” pathogens. 4 / 10 drug levels in 5 pts treated with IDRs (1 g q 6 h of MEM in 3 -hour infusion and a median of 22 g/day of TZP in continuous infusion) were adequate (1 / 2 MEM, 3 / 8 TZP). Conclusions: This is the largest prospective case series of measured BSBL serum levels in infected, obese, non-critically ill pts. SDRs resulted in insufficient serum concentrations to treat « DTT» pathogens {{in most of these}} pts. Recommended dosage regimens of BSBL for obese, non-critically ill pts need to be reconsidered. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A recent {{prospective}} study on beta-lactams levels in septic patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) recommended the following dosage regimens: 2 gq 8 h for ceftazidime or cefepime (CEF), 4 gq 6 h for piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), and 1 gq 8 h for <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM).</b> 1 We applied these regimens in our hospital since December 2009. The aim {{of our study}} was to evaluate the adequacy of this dosage strategy in a cohort of septic patients undergoing CRRT. Methods: Retrospective observational study from 01 / 01 / 2010 to 31 / 05 / 2011. Inclusion criteria were: a) sepsis, b) CRRT; c) treatment with CEF, TZP or MEM, and d) at least one measure of beta-lactam levels. Serum concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV). Blood samples were taken twice during the elimination phase after a 30 -min intravenous administration of the drug. The two samples were {{used to calculate the}} time spent above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which was empirically considered as the clinical breakpoint for "difficult-to-treat" bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adequate therapy was defined as serum concentrations between 4 to 8 times the MIC during optimal periods of time for each drug: > 70 % for CEF, > 50 % for TZP, and > 40 % for MEM. Underdosing and overdosing were defined as drug concentrations that were respectively 8 times the MIC during optimal periods of time. Early and late phases of therapy were considered if drug levels measurement was performed within 48 hours or later on, respectively. Results: Fifty drugs levels were obtained from 36 patients; 15 during the early and 35 during the late septic phase. Drug levels obtained for each antibiotic are shown in Figure 1. Conclusions: Administering a higher beta-lactam dosage regimen for septic patients receiving CRRT avoided insufficient drug concentrations in most patients. Nevertheless, therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed routinely in order to adapt beta-lactam doses and to avoid drug accumulation. References: 1.

40|$|Introduction: The use of {{standard}} doses of β-lactam antibiotics during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) {{may result in}} inadequate serum concentrations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the adequacy of unadjusted drug regimens (i. e. similar to those used in patients with normal renal function) in patients treated with CRRT and the influence of CRRT intensity on drug clearance. Methods: We reviewed data from 50 consecutive adult patients admitted to our Department of Intensive Care in whom routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics (ceftazidime or cefepime, CEF; piperacillin/tazobactam; TZP; <b>meropenem,</b> <b>MEM)</b> was performed using unadjusted β-lactam antibiotics regimens (CEF = 2  g q 8 h; TZP = 4  g q 6 h; MEM = 1  g q 8 h). Serum drug concentrations were measured twice during the elimination phase by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV). We considered therapy was adequate when serum drug concentrations were between 4 and 8 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during optimal periods of time for each drug (≥ 70 % for CEF; ≥ 50 % for TZP; ≥ 40 % for MEM). Therapy was considered as early (ET) or late (LT) phase if TDM was performed within 48  hours of antibiotic initiation or later on, respectively. Results: We collected 73 serum samples from 50 patients (age 58 ± 13  years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score on admission 21 (17 - 25)), 35 during ET and 38 during LT. Drug concentrations were above 4 times the MIC in 63 (90 %), but above 8 times the MIC in 39 (53 %) samples. The proportions of patients with adequate drug concentrations during ET and LT were quite similar. We found a weak but significant correlation between β-lactam antibiotics clearance and CRRT intensity. Conclusions: In septic patients undergoing CRRT, doses of β-lactam antibiotics similar to those given to patients with normal renal function achieved drug levels above the target threshold in 90 % of samples. Nevertheless, 53 % of samples were associated with very high drug levels and daily drug regimens may need to be adapted accordingly. © 2014 Beumier et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|AbstractAim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the costs of {{management}} of moderate to severe infections in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin (IC) and <b>meropenem</b> (<b>MEM).</b> Pharmacoeconomic studies in Saudi Arabia are scarce. The current hospital formulary contains 2 carbapenems: IC and MEM. These antibiotics share a similar spectrum of activity. There are conflicting reviews with regard to the relative cost-effectiveness of these two agents. Methods: A retrospective, single-centre cohort study of 88 patients of IC versus MEM in moderate to severe infections was performed, applying cost-minimization analysis (CMA) methods. In accordance with CMA methods, the assumption of equivalent efficacy was first demonstrated by literature retrieved and appraised. Adult patients (⩾ 18 years old) diagnosed with moderate to severe infections, including skin and skin structure infections (SSIs), sepsis, intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), who were prescribed IC 500 mg every six hours intravenously (2 g per day) or MEM 1 g every eight hours (3 g per day), were included in the study. Only direct costs related to the management of the infections were included, in accordance with a payer perspective. Results: Overall there was no difference in the mean total daily costs between IC (SAR 4784. 46, 95 % CI 4140. 68, 5428. 24) and MEM (4390. 14, 95 % CI 3785. 82, 4994. 45; p= 0. 37). A significantly lower medicine acquisition cost per vial of IC was observed when compared to MEM, however there was a significantly higher cost attached to administration sets used in the IC group than the MEM group. Consultation, nursing and physician costs were not significantly different between the groups. No differences were observed in costs associated with adverse drug events (ADEs). Conclusion: This study has shown that while acquisition costs of IC at a dose of 500 mg q 6 h may be lower than for MEM 1 g q 8 h, mean total costs per day were not significantly different between IC and MEM, indicating that medicine costs are only a small element of the overall costs of managing moderate to severe infections...|$|E
