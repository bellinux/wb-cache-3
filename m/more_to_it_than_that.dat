2500|$|For Alexander {{to marry}} a {{daughter}} of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Alexander, says Arrian [...] "...wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children...". Thus {{it is possible to}} imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E

[...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is <b>more,</b> much <b>more,</b> <b>to</b> language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next.

At any rate, I couldn't come to you to encumber you, to be a drag upon you. I felt that I must have something to offer you. I've got a plan, Maude, for my life, for our lives.

6000|$|First he had labored {{with his}} hands. What {{infinite}} meaning lay unfolding to her vision! Somewhere {{out of it}} all came the conception that man was intended to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. But there was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> By that toil and sweat, by the friction of horny palms, by the expansion and contraction of muscle, by the acceleration of blood, something great and enduring, something physical and spiritual, came to a man.

Any toil was splendid that served this end for any man. It all went back to the survival of the fittest. And suddenly Carley thought of Morrison. He could dance and dangle attendance upon her, and amuse her--but how would he have acquitted himself in a moment of peril? She had her doubts. Most assuredly he could not have beaten down for her a ruffian like Haze Ruff. What then should be the significance of a man for a woman? ...|$|E

60|$|But all this—the mysterious, {{far-reaching}} hairline trail, {{the absence}} of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all—made no impression on the man. It was {{not because he was}} long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man’s frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man’s place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> was a thought that never entered his head.|$|E
