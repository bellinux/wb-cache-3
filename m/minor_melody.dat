500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E <b>minor</b> <b>melody</b> in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one of us will be a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{view that}} perceived emotion in music is derived mainly from auditory signals {{has led to}} neglect of the contribution of visual image. In this study, we manipulated mode (major vs. minor) and examined {{the influence of a}} video image on emotional judgment in music. Melodies in either major or minor mode were controlled for tempo and rhythm and played to the participants. We found that Taiwanese participants, like Westerners, judged major melodies as expressing positive, and <b>minor</b> <b>melodies</b> negative, emotions. The major or <b>minor</b> <b>melodies</b> were then paired with video images of the singers, which were either emotionally congruent or incongruent with their modes. Results showed that participants perceived stronger positive or negative emotions with congruent audio-visual stimuli. Compared to listening to music alone, stronger emotions were perceived when an emotionally congruent video image was added and weaker emotions were perceived when an incongruent image was added. We therefore demonstrate that mode is important to perceive the emotional valence in music and that treating musical art as a purely auditory event might lose the enhanced emotional strength perceived in music, since going to a concert may lead to stronger perceived emotion than listening to the CD at home...|$|R

5000|$|After the high-spirited scherzo, {{the slow}} {{movement}} {{has a strong}} air of sadness.

[...] It is in conventional ternary form with the main C <b>minor</b> <b>melody</b> giving way to a central theme in A major, before returning to end the movement.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that memory for music possesses a number of similarities to the more frequently studied modalities of verbal and visual memory. The present study addresses a yet uninvestigated factor involved in the memory for music: mood. Specifically, the study explored whether a mood-congruency effect is attained using major and minor keys as memory stimuli. Sixty undergraduate students were placed in a positive, negative, or neutral (i. e. baseline) mood. They were then presented with four major and four <b>minor</b> <b>melodies,</b> and, following a short delay, underwent a recognition task for the melodies. The results showed {{the presence of a}} highly significant mood-congruency effect. In a positive mood, melodies in major keys were better recognized than <b>melodies</b> in <b>minor</b> keys, whereas the reverse effect was seen for negative moods. Results are discussed in terms of how these findings relate to previous work on memory for music and linguistics...|$|R
50|$|The Intermezzo {{is marked}} by its flowing sound, created by keeping {{a steady stream of}} {{right-hand}} notes in the background, interspersed with melody notes. The piece, almost entirely based on transpositions, appears difficult at first due to its speed (some musicologists have remarked that Schumann's metronome was calibrated such that it went faster than it should have, due to extreme tempi such as this one). While the background notes in the right hand do indeed move extremely fast, the melody is more singing. The background notes are mostly suited to the shape and position of the hand, despite a few leaps of the melody; in the end, the left hand takes a modified, E-flat major version of the E-flat <b>minor</b> <b>melody,</b> under the right hand. The work is a melancholy and emotionally charged display of a pianist's capability to convey feeling.|$|E
5000|$|Several of T-Pain's stylistic {{effects are}} present in this song, {{including}} Auto-Tune and call and answer during the chorus. It contains electronic elements featuring 808-style drums and an arpeggiated note sequence instead of a chord progression. Flo Rida has sexually charged (but not explicit) lyrics, for example he refers to a woman's buttocks as [...] "birthday cakes" [...] which [...] "stole the show". T-Pain also relies heavily on synthesizers. The song is written in the key of E♭ minor. A Harmonic <b>minor</b> <b>melody</b> is played over the E♭ minor, and at different times different instrumentation cycles, i.e. sometimes only the synthesizer plays, sometimes only the bass, sometimes only the vocals. Flo Rida uses a style that is common in 1990s hip-hop party music. [...] "Low" [...] is written in common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute while T-Pain's vocal range spans nearly two to three octaves from B♭1 to F3.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{relation}} between tonality and musical memory has been fairly well-studied, less is known regarding the contribution of tonal-schematic expectancies to this relation. Three experiments investigated the influence of tonal expectancies on memory for single tones in a tonal melodic context. In the first experiment, listener responses indicated superior recognition of both expected and unexpected targets in a major tonal context than for moderately expected targets. Importantly, and in support of previous work on false memories, listener responses also revealed a higher false alarm rate for expected than unexpected targets. These results indicate roles for tonal schematic congruency as well as distinctiveness in memory for melodic tones. The second experiment utilized <b>minor</b> <b>melodies,</b> which weakened tonal expectancies since the minor tonality can be represented in three forms simultaneously. Finally, tonal expectancies were abolished entirely in the third experiment {{through the use of}} atonal melodies. Accordingly, the expectancy-based results observed in the first experiment were disrupted in the second experiment, and disappeared in the third experiment. These results are discussed in light of schema theory, musical expectancy, and classic memory work on the availability and distinctiveness heuristics...|$|R

40|$|The thesis lacks CD. The musical {{program of}} this recital {{represents}} {{a range of}} periods, from baroque to romantic, and demonstrates an equally wide range of emotion through text and music. Sampling songs from England, Italy, Germany and France also reveals diversity in language and nationality. Studying this music has been a pleasure because of how {{the diversity of the}} music provided an opportunity for much learning and growth. In the end, this repertoire, through the beautifully interwoven text, melody, and accompaniment, draws the singer and audience into a colorful world of love, hate, beauty, wisdom, religion, new life, and death: a glimpse into the beauty of life. The first section is a brief one with two song selections from Handel's oratorios. Total Eclipse, from Samson (1741), is a snapshot {{in the middle of the}} 3 -act story wherein Samson is found blind and in prison, comforted by his friend, Micah. After a brief piano introduction, the piano rests while Samson cries, "Total eclipse! No sun, no moon" in a haunting E <b>minor</b> <b>melody.</b> The accompaniment slowly comes back in, although not able to lift the heavy chains of sorrow from Samson. The text repeats and is embellished by the singer, expressing great sadness and longing for hope through dissonant half step suspensions and appoggiaturas. Sound an Alarm, from Judas Maccabeus (1746), is a battle cry in which Judas is rallying the people of Israel to destroy the pagan altars of the Seleucid Empire, who have overtaken them. The song opens with Judas calling in recitative, "My arms! Against this Gorgias will I go," after which he launches into a fast-paced, galloping war cry filled with melismas, ascending and descending with speed and agility. At many points, the voice acts as a trumpet, blasting triumphant calls to the people of Israel. The second section is composed of selections from Vincenzo Bellini's Sei Arriete da camera (1829). The first, Malinconia, Ninja gentile, is a typical Bellini song: graceful, tranquil, romantic, poetic, painting a beautiful and delicate picture with the voice. The second, Vanne, o rosa fortunata, is a playful lament of the envy this lover has for the rose upon his beloved's breast. Light-hearted repetitions, the confidence of the vocal lines, and the metaphor of death all point to a lover's interplay that is finally consummated and celebrated. The third, Per pieta, bell' idol mio (number five in Bellini's original group), is the most energetic and passionate of the set. The listener finds the lovers amidst an argument in which the singer is pleading with his beloved "non mi dir chi 'io sonno ingrato" (do not tell me that I am ungrateful). Before the song is over, the lover pledges his love to his beloved, assuring "se fedele a te son io, semi struggo ai tuoi bei lumi, Sallo amor, lo sanno i Numi, il mio core, il tuo lo sa"(that I have been faithful, that I languish under your bright gaze, love knows, the gods know, my heart (knows) and yours knows) (See more in text. ...|$|E
2500|$|Next to the {{passages}} of Scripture recited in cantillation, {{the most ancient}} and still the most important section of the Jewish liturgy is the sequence of benedictions which {{is known as the}} Amidah ("standing prayer"), being the section which in the ritual of the Dispersion more immediately takes the place of the sacrifice offered in the ritual of the Temple on the corresponding occasion. It accordingly attracts the intonation of {{the passages}} which precede and follow it into its own musical rendering. Like the lessons, it, too, is cantillated. This free intonation is not, as with the Scriptural texts, designated by any system of accents, but consists of a melodious development of certain themes or motives traditionally associated with the individual service, and therefore termed by the present writer [...] "prayer-motives." [...] These are each differentiated from other prayer-motives much as are the respective forms of the cantillation, the divergence being especially marked in the tonality due to the modal feeling alluded to above. Tonality depends on that particular position of the semitones or smaller intervals between two successive degrees of the scale which causes the difference in color familiar to modern ears in the contrast between major and <b>minor</b> <b>melodies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Jeremy" [...] {{is in the}} key of A, and intertwines the {{parallel}} modes of major and minor frequently. It features prominent usage of Ament's 12-string Hamer bass guitar, which is pivotal {{to the sound of}} the introduction and end of the recording. The song starts off with the bassline and quiet harmonic notes also on the 12-string bass, and continues in a sedate vein until after the second chorus, when densely layered guitars and vocals gradually enter. At the end the instruments gradually fade out until all that is audible is a clean guitar and the 12-string bass, like the intro. Both instruments play a descending <b>minor</b> key <b>melody,</b> fading out with one single note.|$|R
500|$|On the Yardbirds, Unterberger {{identifies}} lead guitarist Jeff Beck {{as having}} [...] "laid the blueprint for psychedelic guitar", {{and the band}} for defining psychedelic rock's [...] "manic eclecticism ...

[...] All were present on Having a Rave-Up the Yardbirds U.S.-only album on which Beck [...] "emerged as a full-fledged guitar hero", {{in the view of}} Guitar Player magazine. [...] "Heart Full of Soul" [...] (June 1965) was a hit single driven by a distorted fuzz guitar riff by Beck made to simulate the drone of a sitar, which [...] "carried the energy of a new scene" [...] and herald the arrival of new Eastern sounds.|$|R
500|$|... "Help Is on the Way" [...] is a rock song {{containing}} {{elements of}} punk rock and melodic hardcore, {{and has been}} described as [...] "anthemic". According to the song's sheet music, the composition is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute. It follows verse-chorus form, and is composed in the key G♯ <b>minor,</b> with a <b>melody</b> that spans a tonal range of D♯4 to B♭5.|$|R
5000|$|Otto Dix is a darkwave {{group with}} EBM and Industrial tunes. Draw calls their style [...] "electronic avant-garde." [...] The songs' themes centre around post-apocalyptic scenes, psychology, morals, and BDSM. The group uses strident, hysterical melodies in their music, {{sounding}} in <b>minor</b> tonalities. Some <b>melodies</b> {{are similar to}} Dark Ambient. Every song has a tiny solo performance and original image which is made by music, lyrics, Draw's movements, and unusual vocal abilities.|$|R
5000|$|Another [...] "serious" [...] movement, this {{begins with}} low octave C's, which the {{composer}} marked as [...] "like low-sounding bells". From these depths arises a melody {{consisting of a}} series of minor 3rd pairs in a consistent sixteenth/dotted-eighth rhythm (bearing some similarity to the [...] "Verbunkos" [...] from Bartók's dance suite Contrasts). Both these melodic and rhythmic motives get used throughout the movement. After the initial, mournful presentation of the theme comes a suddenly loud repetition of minor 3rds in the right hand, along with a left hand restatement of the main theme marked [...] "as if panicking". After these more agitated explorations of the theme, a much lighter texture prevails with tremolos accompanying another <b>minor</b> 3rd-centric <b>melody.</b> The piece concludes as the low C [...] "bells" [...] continue their inescapable tolling.|$|R
5000|$|... "Out the Blue" [...] {{moves through}} several musical genres, {{starting}} with a gentle, melancholy acoustic guitar and moving through gospel, country and music portions. The sound grows as the song progresses, while Lennon's vocal becomes more assured, going from its original restraint to an expression of [...] "joyful contentment." [...] After the initial acoustic guitar, the piano, pedal steel guitar, bass guitar and drums enter, and eventually a [...] "heavenly choir" [...] is included. Author John Blaney describes the song's piano motif as [...] "majestic" [...] and compares the bass guitar line to those of Lennon's ex-bandmate Paul McCartney. Rodriguez praises the way Lennon's vocal manages to [...] "stay atop the waves" [...] of sound, and project both gratitude and tenderness. Keith Spore of The Milwaukee Sentinel described it as having a [...] "haunting <b>minor</b> key <b>melody</b> in the best Beatle tradition." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Melody and Brian ask a small boy, who {{communicates}} via chalkboard, {{where the}} Albino Farm is. He {{tells them to}} ask a group of unruly and somewhat disgusting teens in a car. There they meet Levi (Chris Jericho) and his two deaf friends, who agree {{to take them to}} the Albino Farm for twenty-five dollars and a view of Melody's breasts. After a <b>minor</b> argument, <b>Melody</b> reluctantly agrees, and they head off to the Albino Farm. The teens drive crazily, causing Melody to vomit. They stop in front of the gates to the farm and get into an argument. A fight between Levi and Brian breaks out and the teens drive away after flipping them off.

5000|$|Avant-garde {{composer}} and theater director J. A.
