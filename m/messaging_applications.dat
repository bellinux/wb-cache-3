500|$|Al Wefaq {{released}} a statement accusing authorities of cutting Internet connection {{in a number of}} areas. [...] "Personal devices of some citizens have also been selectively cut off," [...] the statement added. The secular-leftist Waad society said that instant <b>messaging</b> <b>applications</b> such as WhatsApp had been blocked by VIVA Bahrain telecommunications company. Several citizens also complained of loss of Internet for several hours in different locations during the day. They said the cut was at a time when protests were being held. Previously in February 2011, when the uprising began, a similar situation occurred during which the Internet became either slow or was lost completely. Telecommunication companies said then that the problem was due an overload on Internet networks.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, Samsung began {{rolling out}} an update to Android 4.4 [...] "KitKat" [...] for the S4; the update adds user {{interface}} tweaks {{such as a}} camera shortcut {{on the corner of}} the lock screen, options for setting default launcher and text <b>messaging</b> <b>applications,</b> support for printing, and a new location settings menu for tracking and controlling the use of location tracking by apps. It also makes significant changes to the handling of secondary storage on the device for security reasons; applications' access to the SD card is restricted to designated, app-specific directories only, while full access to internal primary storage is still allowed. Although this behavior has existed since Android 3.0 [...] "Honeycomb", OEMs such as Samsung previously modified their distributions of Android to retain the previous behavior, allowing applications to have unlimited access to SD card contents.|$|E
