5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship {{of the state in}} 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{the child and}} in June {{he was taken to}} Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E

As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
