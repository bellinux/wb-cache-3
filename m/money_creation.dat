25|$|The actual {{increase}} in the money supply through this process may be lower, as (at each step) banks may choose to hold reserves {{in excess of the}} statutory minimum, borrowers may let some funds sit idle, and some members of the public may choose to hold cash, and there also may be delays or frictions in the lending process. Government regulations may also be used to limit the <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> process by preventing banks from giving out loans even though the reserve requirements have been fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Austrian School economists such as Jesús Huerta de Soto and Murray Rothbard {{have also}} {{strongly}} criticized fractional-reserve banking, calling {{for it to}} be outlawed and criminalized. According to them, not only does <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> cause macroeconomic instability (based on the Austrian Business Cycle Theory), but it is a form of embezzlement or financial fraud, legalized only due to the influence of powerful rich bankers on corrupt governments around the world. Politician Ron Paul has also criticized fractional reserve banking based on Austrian School arguments.|$|E

25|$|An institution's {{overnight}} reserves, averaged {{over some}} maintenance period, must equal or exceed its average required reserves, calculated {{over the same}} maintenance period. If this calculation is satisfied, there is no requirement that reserves be held {{at any point in}} time. Hence reserve requirements play only a limited role in <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> in the United States. Since quantitative easing began in 2008, they have been even less important, as an enormous glut of excess reserves now exists (over the whole system, though in theory, individual banks may still run into temporary shortfalls).|$|E
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E

[...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of <b>money,</b> <b>Creation</b> funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> {{process is}} also {{affected}} by the currency drain ratio (the propensity of the public to hold banknotes rather than deposit them with a commercial bank), and the safety reserve ratio (excess reserves beyond the legal requirement that commercial banks voluntarily hold – usually a small amount).

2500|$|The money {{multiplier}} is a heuristic used {{to demonstrate the}} maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some eligible reserves are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed, central banks have recently pursued an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit indirectly so the ceiling implied by the {{money multiplier}} does not impose a limit on <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof of the IMF Research Department {{report that}} the [...] "deposit multiplier" [...] of the {{undergraduate}} economics textbook, where monetary aggregates are created at the initiative of the central bank, through an initial injection of high-powered money into the banking system that gets multiplied through bank lending, turns the actual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism on its head. Benes and Kumhof assert that in most cases where banks ask for replenishment of depleted reserves, the central bank obliges. Under this view, reserves therefore impose no constraints, as the deposit multiplier is simply, {{in the words of}} Kydland and Prescott (1990), a myth. Under this theory, private banks almost fully control the <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> process.|$|E

2500|$|The two economists, Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof, {{working for}} the International Monetary Fund, {{published}} a working paper called The Chicago Plan Revisited suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank reserve requirements and converting from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking. Economists at the Paris School of Economics have commented on the plan, stating that it is already the status quo for coinage currency, and a Norges Bank economist has examined the proposal {{in the context of}} considering the finance industry as part of the real economy.

2500|$|Commercial {{bank money}} is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking {{practice}} where banks keep {{only a fraction}} of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of <b>money</b> <b>creation</b> by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. [...] Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the broad money supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of base money created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the money multiplier) is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.|$|E
