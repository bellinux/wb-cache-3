40|$|An {{experimentally}} derived melt <b>migration</b> <b>profile</b> is {{compared with those}} obtained from compaction theory. A couple is prepared in which a source-for-melt (a disk composed of a silicate glass and olivine) was placed in contact with a sink-for-melt (a disk of polycrystalline olivine) in order to induce melt migration under laboratory conditions. It is noted that melt infiltrates into the sink disk along triple junctions driven by capillary forces. In order to analyze the melt <b>migration</b> <b>profile</b> in terms of compaction theory, the equations developed by McKenzie (1984) to describe porous flow of a liquid in a deformable matrix were modified. The bouyancy force term is replaced with a capillary force term and governing equations are then solved numerically with the initial boundary conditions specified by the experimental design. Also, it is determined that compaction theory provides a good description of the experimental results provided that the permeability of these solid-liquid materials increases linearly with increasing liquid fraction...|$|E

40|$|Complexome {{profiling}} {{is a novel}} technique {{which uses}} shotgun proteomics to establish protein <b>migration</b> <b>profiles</b> from fractionated blue native electrophoresis gels. Here we present a dataset of blue native electrophoresis <b>migration</b> <b>profiles</b> for 953 proteins by complexome profiling. By analysis of mitochondrial ribosomal complexes we demonstrate its potential to verify putative protein-protein interactions identified by affinity purification – mass spectrometry studies. Protein complexes were extracted in their native state from a HEK 293 mitochondrial fraction and separated by blue native gel electrophoresis. Gel lanes were cut into gel slices of even size and analyzed by shotgun proteomics. Subsequently, the acquired protein <b>migration</b> <b>profiles</b> were analyzed for co-migration via hierarchical cluster analysis. This dataset holds great promise as a comprehensive resource for de novo identification of protein-protein interactions or to underpin and prioritize candidate protein interactions from other studies. To demonstrate the potential use of our dataset we focussed on the mitochondrial translation machinery. Our results show that mitoribosomal complexes can be analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis, as at least four distinct complexes. Analysis of these complexes confirmed that 24 proteins {{that had previously been}} reported to co-purify with mitoribosomes indeed co-migrated with subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome. Co-migration of several proteins involved in biogenesis of inner mitochondrial membrane complexes together with mitoribosomal complexes suggested the possibility of co-translational assembly in human cells.

40|$|A major cytopathological {{hallmark}} of {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) {{is the presence of}} axonal spheroids containing abnormally accumulated neurofilaments. The mechanism of their formation, their contribution to the disease, and the possibility of other co-aggregated components are still enigmatic. Here we analyze the composition of such lesions with special reference to stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP), a protein responsible for microtubule cold stabilization. In normal human brain and spinal cord, the distribution of STOP proteins is uniform between the cytoplasm and neurites of neurons. However, all the neurofilament-rich spheroids present in the tissues of affected patients are intensely labeled with 3 different anti-STOP antibodies. Moreover, when neurofilaments and microtubules are isolated from spinal cord and brain, STOP proteins are systematically co-purified with neurofilaments. By SDS-PAGE analysis, no alteration of the <b>migration</b> <b>profile</b> of STOP proteins is observed in pathological samples. Other microtubular proteins, like tubulin or kinesin, are inconstantly present in spheroids, suggesting that a microtubule destabilizing process may be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.
