In 2005, the Billie Mine, an underground borax mine located {{along the road to}} Dante's View, closed, ending mining in the park.|$|E
5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan {{to increase the amount of}} protected areas of Svalbard from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{establish}} an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E

Wildlife (birds, reptiles, small mammals) mortalities, including species of conservation concern, have been documented in <b>mine</b> <b>claim</b> marker posts (Brattstrom 1995, Lahontan and Red Rock Audubon Societies 2009) which resulted in passing a law in Nevada that called {{for the removal of}} all PVC <b>mine</b> <b>claim</b> markers across the state (American Bird Conservancy 2011).

25|$|In 1957, the {{residential}} qualification {{was raised to}} two years in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and the language requirement was raised to demand the ability to read and comprehend English. The means qualifications were changed to create upper and lower rolls and to allow for educational achievements to count towards means. Property ownership was required to have been held for two years and the <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> qualification was eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Edison visited an {{industrial}} exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits {{there could be}} used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> in 1903. A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.|$|E
25|$|This became {{especially}} important {{when in the}} same month that mountains that Lytton was taken on her first voyage, the fabulous Le Roi <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> was staked at Red Mountain near Trail, B.C. Over 6 million tons of lead/zinc/tin and gold ore were {{taken out of the}} claim, worth more than $125 million. One stakeholder bought his stake for $12.50 and sold it for $30,000. The resulting ore boom created a demand for steamboat and rail transportation to the mines near Trail {{and other parts of the}} Kootenay mountains. Lytton became part of the ore boom, hauling ore barges to the smelter at Trail.|$|E
50|$|Non-native {{settlers}} {{arrived with}} the gold rush, beginning in 1850 after the Josiah Gregg expedition discovered Humboldt Bay. Orick was settled not only for being {{on the way to}} <b>mining</b> <b>claims</b> in the Trinity, but for five beach sand <b>mining</b> <b>claims</b> fronting several miles of beach in the Gold Bluff District. The gold sands did not produce well, and the local gold rush was over by the 1870s.|$|R
50|$|The Independence Mine was {{a larger}} {{producing}} {{mine in the}} Pine Creek region of the Coeur d'Alene mining district in Idaho. It produced lead, silver, and copper. The <b>mine</b> <b>claim</b> borders the Bunker Hill Sullivan <b>mine</b> <b>claim,</b> and work in on the mine was stopped in the 1940s. It was a major producer during both world wars. It also had a large hand {{in the development of}} Pinehurst, Idaho.|$|R

25|$|Mining in Rana {{has taken}} place since it was {{established}} at Ormlia in 1799. Ole Tobias Olsen discovered iron ore on his farm of Nord-Dunderland, for which he registered a <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> in 1879. Since 1872, Olsen {{had been working on}} promoting the construction of the Nordland Line northwards from Trondheim. In 1891, he petitioned the government to look at his claim as a source of national wealth and requested that the Nordland Line be built via the Dunderland Valley to allow shipment of the ore to the coastal port of Mo. He received a grant to carry out technical investigations for a railway.|$|E
25|$|Although Denmark–Norway never {{formally}} gave up {{its claim}} to Svalbard, the archipelago {{continued to be a}} terra nullius—a land without a government. The work to establish an administration was initiated by Nordenskiöld in 1871, in which he established that only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Yet the need for jurisdiction came from the mining community. Firstly, there was no means to make a <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} found match documentation {{was from}} 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who got five wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused {{quite a stir}} in the Melbourne Argus when he found 12oz. of gold in a tub of quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which {{it is now the}} Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia. Anderson's Creek won a brilliant victory scoring 114 to their opponents 26 and 36.|$|E

25|$|AuCoin’s {{environmental}} record {{earned him}} the endorsement of major environmental organizations {{in each of his}} House elections. In addition to blocking offshore oil exploration, AuCoin prevented mining in the center of Oregon's Three Sisters Wilderness area by buying out a <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> in the area’s geologically significant Rock Mesa and served on the committee that helped write the 200-mile offshore economic zone, which would become known as the Magnuson Act. Although the Port of Portland shipyards, a major Oregon employer, stood to benefit from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, AuCoin opposed the plan on environmental grounds. He also helped preserve Cascade Head on the Oregon Coast, supported the Columbia Gorge Scenic Protection Act, helped stop the construction of Salt Caves Dam on the last free-flowing stretch of the Klamath River, co-authored the 1988 bill quadrupling the designation of National Wild and Scenic Rivers in Oregon, and fought the construction of a plant at the Umatilla Chemical Depot to incinerate excess chemical weapons.|$|E

500|$|After Yount {{resigned}} {{from his job}} in Yellowstone, he lived {{for a while in}} Uva in Laramie County, Wyoming. [...] He homesteaded in the area in 1887 but his claim was sold in a sheriff's sale in 1892. He spent nearly 40 years prospecting in the Laramie Mountains, and developed copper and graphite mining claims. He settled in Wheatland, Wyoming, and worked on developing a marble <b>mining</b> <b>claim</b> west of there. Yount was actively involved in prospecting until the day before his death, when he had been looking for a ride to inspect a possible gold deposit. On May 16, 1924, he walked into downtown Wheatland, as was his daily habit, where he collapsed and died of heart failure near a Lutheran church. He was buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.|$|E
