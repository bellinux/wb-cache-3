40|$|Shape <b>memory</b> <b>alloys</b> are a {{class of}} ferroic {{materials}} which undergo a structural (martensitic) transition where the associated ferroic property is a lattice distortion (strain). The sensitiveness of {{the transition to the}} conjugated external field (stress), together with the latent heat of the transition gives rise to giant mechanocaloric effects. In non-magnetic shape <b>memory</b> <b>alloys,</b> the lattice distortion is mostly described by a pure shear and the martensitic transition in this family of alloys is strongly affected by uniaxial stress whereas it is basically insensitive to hydrostatic pressure. As a result, non-magnetic alloys exhibit giant elastocaloric effects but negligible barocaloric effects. By contrast, in a number of magnetic shape <b>memory</b> <b>alloys,</b> the lattice distortion at the martensitic transition involves a volume change in addition to the shear strain. Those alloys are affected by both uniaxial stress and hydrostatic pressure and they exhibit giant elastocaloric and barocaloric effects.
