40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the non-destructive testing (NDT) method {{to determine the}} resultant stresses in <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> usually employed in structures. The technique utilized ultrasonic pulse-echo that determined the wave velocity change due to torque applied between bolt and nut. <b>Mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> with nominal diameter of 19 and 25 mm were used. The specimen was loaded {{by means of a}} torque wrench that gave the required amount of moment (~ 300 Nm). This was carefully achieved manually. In order to measure the strain, strain gauges were employed. The direct strain gauge method gives the strain values. This strain is used to calculate the stress due to the applied load. The experiment had been carried out in a control environment with constant temperature. The relationship between torque-velocity, torque-strain and stress-strain is obtained and compared. The test results indicate that ultrasonic wave velocity decrease with the applied torque. This is due to degradation or loss of strength of the material. The potential of this NDT method to obtain structure quality and strength determination is discussed...|$|E

This was later changed to a 6 -day dry, 1 day wet cycle for the carbonation exposure specimens after the initial set of gravimetric testing. The weight loss for each bar due to corrosion was recorded. Instantaneous LPR measurements were also taken on each bar at regular intervals throughout the exposure period.

On the other hand the Indian construction industry is set to face an acute workforce shortage. The shortage of construction workers has in fact slowed down the growth of this industry in major cities across the country and escalated its cost by 40 percent. An alternative way to replace the labor force is by automation techniques. This study is a numerical analysis to evaluate structural behavior of simply supported concrete beams reinforced with welded wires in comparison with <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> reinforced concrete beams. Welding conventional <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> (60 ksi) reduces their shear strength by 50 percent. Welded Wire Reinforcement (80 ksi), with its greater strength, higher durability, significantly lower placing and overall cost, provides an alternative and perhaps a better substitution for <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The commercial finite element analysis program, ABAQUS, was used to model the non-linear behavior of reinforced concrete beams. In order to evaluate the structural behavior of welded wire reinforced concrete beams, different configurations of longitudinal and transverse wires have been considered.

Specimens contained six <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> at two cover depths and two activated titanium reference electrodes. After salt loading for half a year, they were exposed {{for two years in}} various climates (20 °C 80 %RH, outside, fog room). Steel potentials, corrosion rates (using LPR) and concrete resistivities were measured. At the end of the exposure period the actual corrosion loss was assessed from visual examination after taking out <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> and the chloride distribution was measured. The results show a large influence of the cement type on resistivity and on corrosion rates. Concrete resistivities showed an increase with time in all mixes, with significant differences between Portland and blended cements and for different climates. Steel potentials do not discriminate well between negligible and significant corrosion. Corrosion loss from linear polarisation resistance and destructive analysis showed good agreement.

This study thus considered the effect of the surface condition of deformed <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> on the bond strength and the flexural {{strength of}} steel-reinforced concrete, with the surface condition being engine oil coating. Bond and flexural test involving concrete embedded with steel bars coated with engine oil and un-coated steel bars (i. e. bars not coated with engine oil) revealed that engine oil coating considerably reduces the bond and flexural strength of reinforced concrete.

40|$|The {{strength}} of steel-reinforced concrete greatly {{depends on the}} adequacy of the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement. Bonding is enhanced by adhesion and frictional resistance between the steel/concrete interface and can adversely be affected by corrosion of the reinforcing steel. In Ghana, steel is the conventional material for the reinforcement of concrete, but there are instances where the steel reinforcement bars used on site have corroded to some extent. This study considers the effect of corrosion of <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> on the tensile strength, bond strength and bending {{strength of}} steel-reinforced concrete beam. Tests were conducted to determine the tensile and bonding strength of non-corroded and corroded mild steel bars, and the flexural strength of concrete beams reinforced with non-corroded and corroded mild steel bars, {{on the assumption that the}} flexural strength of the beam is derived primarily from the concrete/steel bonding action. The research revealed that the tensile and bond strengths of non-corroded steel bar and the flexural strength of non-corroded steel-reinforced concrete beam are greater than that of corroded steel bar. The findings of the research demonstrates that corrosion of steel reinforcement adversely affects the strength of steel reinforcement and steel-reinforced concrete and it is thus recommended that non-corroded steel bars should be used for reinforcement in reinforced concrete construction...|$|E
40|$|Chloride-induced {{reinforcement}} corrosion {{in concrete}} is characterised by {{the action of}} so-called macrocells. The associated localised form of corrosion results from the strong electrochemical interaction between the relatively small pitting sites acting as anodes and the large passive steel areas acting as cathodes. The existence of macrocell corrosion poses severe problems in the interpretation of results obtained from corrosion experiments, especially regarding corrosion potential and galvanic current. To elucidate the mechanism of macroceU corrosion experimental investigations were conducted on reinforcement steel embedded in chloride-contaminated concrete. The macrocells were provoked by shortcircuiting actively corroding <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to passivated stainless steel, thereby intensifying the corrosion process. The experiments included measurement of corrosion potential, ionic concrete resistance, potential difference, corrosion rate and galvanic current. The magnitude of the galvanic current is significantly influenced by the resistance of passive steel to polarisation, and to a much lesser degree by the ionic concrete resistance. Results from potential mapping demonstrated that due to macrocell action the rest potential of the passive steel was shifted towards very negative values that, according to many codes of practice, would suggest active corrosion to take place.

However, observations from the recent major earthquakes {{have shown that the}} structural interaction between columns and infill walls of RC frames under seismic excitation can significantly alter the structural behaviour, thus causing catastrophic consequences. This paper presents shake table tests on 1 / 3 -scale RC frame specimens with infill wall under real earthquake excitation inputs, with the aim at verifying the effectiveness and applicability of proposed flexible connection details at column-to-infill interface. Taking into account of similitude requirements, the artificial mass simulation model has been utilised during specimen design process.

Columns and infill walls are connected by spaced <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the gaps between them are filled with polystyrene foam. The test results indicate that the proposed flexible column-infill connection details can effectively improve the seismic performance of masonry-infilled RC frame structures by reducing the undesirable interaction between columns and infill wall. In addition, the displacement ductility and energy dispassion capacity of the frame system can be considerably improved...|$|R
