Twenty multiparous cows 26 ± 6 days before expected calving were assigned randomly to two treatments containing 1) 140 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 DM CP (34 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 DM PBPM) 2) 160 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 DM CP (75 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 DM PBPM). The cow’s BCS was 3. 56 ± 0. 5 on average, at the beginning of the trial. Yields of milk, protein, lactose and fat were not affected by prepartum dietary CP level. Colostrum composition (fat, CP and total solids percents), blood metabolites (Ca, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea N and cholesterol) and metabolic diseases incidence were not influenced by prepartum dietary CP level. There was no significant difference between treatments in body weight and BCS changes. As expected, blood urea N before calving was higher in the cows fed 160 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 DM CP diets (p< 0. 002).

The study consisted of four feeding treatments involving GS and MS alone and GS and MS mixtures in a ratio of 67 : 33 or 33 : 67 (dry matter (DM) basis) fed twice daily. The GS was high <b>in</b> DM (463 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1), neutral detergent fibre (715 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) and acid detergent fibre (429 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) while low in crude protein (90. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM). The DM content (<b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1) and starch concentration (<b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 DM) of MS were 264 and 211, respectively. The inclusion of MS into diet had positive linear effects on fresh matter ad libitum intake (kg d 1 and <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 M 0. 75 d 1) (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001 respectively), digestibility of DM (P < 0. 01), organic matter (P < 0. 01), acid detergent fibre (P < 0. 05), starch (P < 0. 001), digestibility of organic matter in DM (D-value) (P < 0. 001), nitrogen intake (P < 0. 01) and nitrogen output in faeces (P < 0. 01). A positive associative effect of low quality GS and MS was observed for ad libitum intake (kg d 1 and <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1 M 0. 75 d 1) of fresh matter (quadratic, P < 0. 01), DM (quadratic, P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 01 respectively) and organic matter (P < 0. 001), for digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, crude protein, starch and D-value (quadratic, P < 0. 01), digestibility of organic matter (quadratic, P < 0. 05), nitrogen intake (quadratic, P < 0. 001) and nitrogen balance (quadratic, P < 0. 05).

Australia contributes approximately 8 % of gross global carbon emissions from biomass burning, yet there are few previous measurements of emissions from Australian forest fires available in the literature. This paper describes the results of field measurements of trace gases emitted during hazard reduction burns in Australian temperate forests using open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In a companion paper, similar techniques are used to characterise the emissions from hazard reduction burns in the savanna regions of the Northern Territory. Details of the experimental methods are explained, including both the measurement set-up and the analysis techniques employed. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} different ways to estimate whole-fire emission factors are discussed and a measurement uncertainty budget is developed. Emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires are measured locally for the first time for many trace gases. Where ecosystem-relevant data are required, we recommend the following emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires (in grams of gas emitted per kilogram of dry fuel burned) which are our mean measured values: 1620 ± 160 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon dioxide; 120 ± 20 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon monoxide; 3. 6 ± 1. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methane; 1. 3 ± 0. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethylene; 1. 7 ± 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formaldehyde; 2. 4 ± 1. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methanol; 3. 8 ± 1. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetic acid; 0. 4 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formic acid; 1. 6 ± 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ammonia; 0. 15 ± 0. 09 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of nitrous oxide and 0. 5 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethane...|$|R

In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), crude protein (CP), nitrate, acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL), and protein and fiber digestion were determined;Greatest yields were observed after 70 DAP, averaging 5500 kg ha [...] 1.

40|$|Savanna fires {{contribute}} approximately 40 – 50 % {{of total}} global annual biomass burning carbon emissions. Recent comparisons of emission factors from different savanna regions have highlighted {{the need for}} a regional approach to emission factor development, and better assessment of the drivers of the temporal and spatial variation in emission factors. This paper describes the results of open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopic field measurements at 21 fires occurring in the tropical savannas of the Northern~Territory, Australia, within different vegetation assemblages and at different stages of the dry season. Spectra of infrared light passing through a long (22 – 70 m) open-path through ground-level smoke released from these fires were collected using an infrared lamp and a field-portable FTIR system. The IR spectra were used to retrieve the mole fractions of 14 different gases present within the smoke, and these measurements used to calculate the emission ratios and emission factors of the various gases emitted by the burning. Only a handful of previous emission factor measures are available specifically for the tropical savannas of Australia and here we present the first reported emission factors for methanol, acetic acid, and formic acid for this biome. Given the relatively large sample size, it was possible to study the potential causes of the within-biome variation of the derived emission factors. We find that the emission factors vary substantially between different savanna vegetation assemblages; with a majority of this variation being mirrored by variations in the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) of different vegetation classes. We conclude that a significant majority of the variation in the emission factor for trace gases can be explained by MCE, irrespective of vegetation class, as illustrated by variations in the calculated methane emission factor for different vegetation classes using data sub-set by different combustion efficiencies. Therefore, the selection of emission factors for emissions modelling purposes need not necessarily require detailed fuel type information, if data on MCE (e. g. from future spaceborne total column measurements) or a correlated variable were available. From measurements at 21 fires, we recommend the following emission factors for Australian tropical savanna fires (in grams of gas emitted per kilogram of dry fuel burned), which are our mean measured values: 1674 ± 56 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon dioxide; 87 ± 33 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon monoxide; 2. 1 ± 1. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methane; 0. 11 ± 0. 04 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetylene; 0. 49 ± 0. 22 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethylene; 0. 08 ± 0. 05 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethane; 1. 57 ± 0. 44 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formaldehyde; 1. 06 ± 0. 87 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methanol; 1. 54 ± 0. 64 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetic acid; 0. 16 ± 0. 07 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formic acid; 0. 53 ± 0. 31 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of hydrogen cyanide; and 0. 70 ± 0. 36 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ammonia.
