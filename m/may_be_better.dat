5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Tolerant of both {{heat and}} cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture {{hardiness}} zones three through nine, although some cultivars <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited {{than others to}} extremes of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east {{across much of the}} country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the tax on}} {{interest}} income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, {{in some cases the}} benefit derived from tax deferral may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> alternatives for value accumulation.|$|E
25|$|The Higgs boson validates the Standard Model {{through the}} {{mechanism}} of mass generation.

25|$|The normal {{distribution}} is a subclass of the elliptical distributions. The {{normal distribution}} is symmetric about its mean, and is non-zero {{over the entire}} real line. As such {{it may not be}} a suitable model for variables that are inherently positive or strongly skewed, such as the weight of a person or the price of a share. Such variables <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> described by other distributions, such as the log-normal distribution or the Pareto distribution.|$|E
25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
