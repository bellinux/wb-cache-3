5|$|The Russian {{doctrine}} of military deception has evolved with time, and it encompasses {{a number of}} meanings. The Russian term маскировка (maskirovka) literally means <b>masking.</b> An early military meaning was camouflage, soon extended to battlefield <b>masking</b> using smoke and other methods of screening. From there it came to have the broader meaning of military deception, widening to include denial and deception.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} <b>masking</b> agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or <b>masking</b> the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain <b>masking</b> provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} Japanese armor <b>masks</b> are analyzed {{within the context}} of the Japanese <b>mask</b> culture. Essentially armor <b>masks</b> have a protective function and are, within the Japanese <b>mask</b> culture, the only <b>masks</b> which are not used for theater, dance or religious processions. The roots of menpō or “armor <b>masks</b> with facial features” are unknown, therefore, the subject is approached from the existing Japanese <b>mask</b> disciplines. The diversity and the connections with existing <b>mask</b> disciplines, especially nō <b>masks,</b> shows us that the Japanese armor <b>masks</b> form an integral part within the Japanese <b>mask</b> culture.

5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from <b>masking</b> the atomic properties.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby <b>masking</b> the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E

40|$|In {{addressing}} {{the challenge of}} the low survival rates of rats with myocardial ischaemia, we developed a novel respiratory <b>mask.</b> We tested this <b>mask</b> on the rat model.

These features include: <b>mask</b> shape, <b>mask</b> inlet and outlet, <b>mask</b> connection to the respiratory machine, <b>mask</b> mount on the rat head. We examined the rat <b>mask</b> in a model of chronic myocardial ischaemia; our model was the ligation of the coronary artery.

In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups.

5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance.

These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory <b>masking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture <b>masking</b> interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

50|$|A dust <b>mask</b> is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A dust <b>mask</b> can also be worn to protect against allergens. A dust <b>mask</b> is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint <b>mask</b> or surgical <b>mask,</b> but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong <b>mask</b> for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust <b>masks</b> with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even <b>masks</b> that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint <b>masks</b> and surgical <b>masks.</b> Misfitting <b>masks</b> are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the <b>mask</b> entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in <b>masks</b> that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mists. Dust <b>masks</b> are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust <b>masks</b> with paint <b>masks.</b>|$|R
