5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best <b>man</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E
5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged <b>man</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E

5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth <b>man,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 2 is a {{platform}} and action game like its predecessor, Mega Man. The player controls Mega <b>Man</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> traverses eight stages {{to defeat the}} bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing {{the order in which}} the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.|$|E

Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired <b>Man</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E

25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken <b>man</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E

Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and stage related to the weapon's power. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon is added to Mega Man's arsenal.
