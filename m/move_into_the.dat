5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, they can <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used}} to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E
