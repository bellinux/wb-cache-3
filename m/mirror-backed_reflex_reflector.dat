40|$|New {{cassegrain}} feed cone assemblies {{were designed}} {{as part of}} the upgrade of three 26 -meter diameter antennas to 34 -meter diameter with improved performance. The new dual-frequency feed cone (SXD) will provide both S- and X-band feed systems and traveling wave masers, with a <b>reflex</b> <b>reflector</b> system to permit simultaneous operation analogous to the 64 -meter antennas. Tasks involved in adding the X-band receiving capability and improving the S-band feed performance in support of Voyager and later missions described in...|$|R
40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO reviewed the Federal Highway Administration (FHwA) new rule on installing reflectors on the sides and rear of semitrailers and trailers. GAO noted that: (1) the new rule requires motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce to install retroreflective tape or <b>reflex</b> <b>reflectors</b> on the sides and rear of semitrailers and trailers that were manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, and meet certain size and weight requirements; and (2) FHwA complied with applicable requirements in promulgating the rule. ...|$|R
50|$|In various {{countries}} the laws mandated that road-registered machines have lights/horn/blinkers/stop lights/mirrors in various permutations. In some countries {{this led to}} unusually large rear tail-light assemblies and round red <b>reflex</b> safety <b>reflectors</b> on some models, as Suzuki ensured their compliance with local design rules. All PE's came fitted with effective mufflers, with restrictors and double-walled expansion chambers (with mesh) to meet noise and spark restrictor laws where applicable.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance of low-beam headlamps. The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle <b>reflex</b> <b>reflectors,</b> visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance of low-beam headlamps. The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use of longer-life headlamps...|$|R
50|$|Iron sights are {{a system}} of shaped {{alignment}} markers (usually metal) used as a sighting device {{to assist in the}} aiming of a device such as a firearm, crossbow, or telescope, and exclude the use of optics as in <b>reflector</b> (<b>reflex)</b> sights, holographic sights, and telescopic sights.|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} study {{evaluated the}} performance of 40 first-generation low-beam headlamps that were either visually/optically aimable (VOA) or that met the GTB harmonized beam pattern, by comparing these low beams to conventional U. S., European, and Japanese low beams. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of pavement delineation, visibility of retroreflective traffic signs, visibility of vehicle rear <b>reflex</b> <b>reflectors,</b> visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, and foreground illumination. For each performance aspect, typical geometric situations (points in space) were specified in terms of longitudinal, lateral, and vertical positions, and the corresponding visual angles {{from each of the}} two headlamps were calculated. The effects of the novel low beams were quantified by calculating the percent changes in luminous intensity directed from both lamps towards the points in space representing the performance aspects. The results are presented separately for the VOA lamps that are aimable on the left side (VOL lamps) and the right side (VOR lamps), {{as well as for the}} harmonized lamps. The present results could be used by lamp designers to maximize the advantages of the future versions of these novel low beams, while minimizing their disadvantages...|$|R
50|$|A {{telescopic}} sight, {{commonly called}} a scope, is a sighting device {{that is based}} on an optical refracting telescope. They are equipped with some form of graphic image pattern (a reticle) mounted in an optically appropriate position in their optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used with all types of systems that require accurate aiming but are most commonly found on firearms, particularly rifles. Other types of sights are iron sights, <b>reflector</b> (<b>reflex)</b> sights, and laser sights. The optical components may be combined with optoelectronics to form a night scope.|$|R
5000|$|The Aimpoint CompM4 is a [...] "tubed" [...] style <b>reflector</b> (<b>reflex)</b> {{sight that}} uses a red {{light-emitting}} diode (LED) at {{the focus of a}} mirror type optical collimator to produce an aligned red aiming spot (what is commonly called a red dot sight). There are a total of 16 brightness settings for the LED, the lower 7 intended for use with night vision devices and the upper 9 for daylight. The CompM4 is powered by a standard AA battery, and the manufacturer claims that the sight will run continuously for 8 years on a single battery, in its 10th brightness setting.|$|R
5000|$|Another type of finder {{commonly}} found on amateur telescopes {{is known as}} a <b>reflector</b> (<b>reflex)</b> sight. This non-magnifying sight (technically not a [...] "scope") uses a type of beam splitter to [...] "reflect" [...] a reticle generated by collimating optics into the users field of view. The view of the sky seen through the sight is just what can be seen with the naked eye with an illuminated crosshair or dot seeming to float in space at infinity. These crosshairs are generally illuminated by a small LED. Reflector sights are useful for locating bright objects {{visible to the naked eye}} such as stars and planets. Since the sight uses a beam splitter [...] "window", instead of an optical telescope with the ability to gather light, objects dimmer than the naked eye limit can not be seen through it. Finding dim objects with a reflector sight is accomplished by using the object's known position relative to brighter objects as a reference and then slewing a known angular distance (or [...] "star hopping") from the bright object to the desired object. Many reflector sights have circles with a given angular dimension in order to facilitate this. Reflector sights are less useful in light polluted areas since the stars used to guide the observer to a dim object may also be invisible.|$|R
