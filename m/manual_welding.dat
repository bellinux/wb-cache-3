5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for <b>manual</b> <b>welding</b> processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in <b>manual</b> <b>welding,</b> it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

Using the inverter power supply type provides less heat input into a molten electrode metal drop which decreases silicium and manganese burning, improves impact resistance under low (negative) temperature and reduces the risk of workers respiratory diseases.

40|$|As {{part of the}} “Ultrasonics as an Alternative to Radiography for Weld Inspection (UT/RT) Program”, an {{evaluation}} of computer-assisted ultrasonics was performed. Briefly, this evaluation consisted of inspecting 33 UT/RT test plates, 650 feet of welds being fabricated in new construction, and 542 inches of welds in overhaul. Eight Navy UT inspectors and one “experienced” operator of the computer-assisted ultrasonic system inspected the test plates using the P-scan system with a <b>manual</b> <b>weld</b> scanner.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Occupational asthma (OA) can {{be induced}} by fumes of <b>manual</b> metal-arc <b>welding</b> on {{stainless}} steel. In recent years, {{the use of}} special stainless steels (SSS) with high chromium content has increased. This study presents two cases of OA caused by <b>manual</b> metal-arc <b>welding</b> on SSS. In both cases, the diagnosis of OA was based on respiratory symptoms, occupational exposure and positive findings in the specific challenge tests. In the first case, a 46 -yr-old welder had experienced severe dyspnoea while welding SSS (SMO steel), but not in other situations. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a common electrode were negative. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 37 % drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). In the second case, a 34 -yr-old male had started to experience dyspnoea {{during the past few}} years, while welding especially SSS (Duplex steel). The workplace peak expiratory flow monitoring was suggestive of OA. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a common electrode did not cause bronchial obstruction. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 31 % drop in FEV 1. In conclusion, exposure to <b>manual</b> metal-arc <b>welding</b> fumes of special stainless steel should be considered as a new cause of occupational asthma...|$|R
