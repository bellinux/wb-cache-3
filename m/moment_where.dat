5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|The final death {{scene in}} Tenebrae – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a {{sculpture}} – is directly referenced in Kenneth Branagh's Hitchcockian murder mystery Dead Again (1991). Kim Newman maintains that Branagh's film imitates the sequence so entirely – with Derek Jacobi being pierced by the sculpture – that Branagh must {{have included the}} reference deliberately. The subsequent <b>moment,</b> <b>where</b> Nicolodi screams repeatedly in the rain, was cited by Asia Argento (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.|$|E
5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E

25|$|During rehearsals, a dance routine was devised for {{the song}} which {{went on to become}} famous for the <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> the girls' skirts are ripped off halfway through – only to reveal shorter skirts underneath.

25|$|This vision lasted {{approximately}} {{twenty-four hours}} and {{was said to}} have had a powerful impact on his overall perception of reality as well as his entire self. While the revelation was overpowering and transformative, it was the only visual <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> Nathan of Gaza felt that he was a true prophet. Nevertheless, in addition to his physical and mental alteration, there was another important component to the vision: Nathan of Gaza believed that a {{man by the name of}} Shabbetai Zevi was the messiah. This strong belief in Shabbetai Zevi as the next leader of the Jewish people marked the initiation of the first Sabbatean believer, Nathan of Gaza. It also constituted the beginning of the Sabbatean movement itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} Lost Inside a Dream: The Story of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy by the Danish {{film maker}} Theis Molin exploring the band's rise, break-up and reunion premiered at the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival on 4 November 2010. The band attended the film's second screening on 8 November 2010, where they answered {{questions from the}} audience. On the same day, the 2CD/DVD and 2CD/Blu-ray set Live in Concert 2010 was released, which includes the documentary and features a live recording of two concerts in the K.B. Hallen on 1617 April 2010, making it the first Danish performance {{to be released in}} Full HD. The <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> Dizzy Mizz Lizzy were awarded a platinum record for this live recording would later be considered the turning point towards a more permanent comeback. Molin received the Politiken Publikumspris (People's choice award) for his documentary.|$|E

25|$|To {{create the}} alien water tentacle, Cameron {{initially}} considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic. The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM. ILM designed {{a program to}} produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod. For the <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage. The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed {{for more than a}} month by production and special effects problems. The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} and teaching interests revolve around Indigenous-Settler relations, contemporary colonial cultural forms, and the anthropology of space and place.

Scanning contemporary political and cultural landscapes for those <b>moments</b> <b>where</b> Indigenous-Settler relations play out, our gaze is most often directed towards issues of land, territoriality, and place. Tensions often run high on these terrains, understood, valued, and experienced differently. As a result I am interested in how places are produced, maintained, contested and shifting while often being taken for granted as fixed givens...|$|R
