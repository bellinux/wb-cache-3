5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a lot of people}} who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, as O'Brien was recovering, he {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} the Associated Press, and explained {{that one of the reasons}} he took part in the feud was because, [...] " [...] had been leaving me threatening messages.

But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wanted to hit them [...] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse." ...|$|E
500|$|Berger also {{commented on}} the situation, saying [...] "I no longer {{understand}} anything. Formula One has become a joke." [...] In the lead-up to the San Marino Grand Prix, Schumacher was quoted saying that Berger should [...] "concentrate on racing instead of thinking how he can criticise <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never understood how someone can celebrate a victory like that [...] one lap down and winning after someone else has been disqualified." [...] Berger responded to Schumacher's comments by saying: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Ripken got {{to coach}} {{his own son}} as Cal Jr. reached the major leagues. He always downplayed the father-son {{relationship}}, saying in 1981 spring training, [...] "There isn't any father-son relationship here. I managed 14 years in the minors, including 1967 right in Miami, and saw hundreds of kids. They're all my sons, more or less. On this field or on this club, my son is just another ballplayer to <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a job and a life and so does he." ...|$|E

60|$|The judges sat {{grave and}} mute, {{gave me an}} easy hearing, and time to say all that I would, but, saying neither Yes nor No to it, {{pronounced}} the sentence of death upon me, a sentence that was to me like death itself, which, after it was read, confounded <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no more spirit left in <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no tongue to speak, or eyes to look up either to God or man.|$|R
500|$|... "I've {{been living}} in Chicago and {{spending}} a lot of time there, and that's where R. Kelly hails from. I was working on Artpop and I wrote [...] on tour. It was about my obsession with the way people view <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always been an R. Kelly fan and actually it is like an epic pastime in the Haus of Gaga that we just get fucked up and play R. Kelly. This is a real R song and I [...] have to call the king of R and I need his blessing.' It was a mutual love." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{an awesome}} producer. He {{really helped me}} get the plan and have {{confidence}} in the decisions that we made. For <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of ideas and sometimes it just comes down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm doing these things I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E
500|$|Jackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, [...] "There {{were some}} people who didn't like the {{direction}} I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E

500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds. Are you to tell me that one is as difficult as the other?" ...|$|E
500|$|During his {{theatrical}} days, Davidson maintained {{high standards}} of personal morality, observed strict teetotalism and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the Thames Embankment in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl {{who was about to}} throw herself into the Thames. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near Cambridge, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: [...] "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on <b>me...</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever since... kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush is of English, French, and Swiss ancestry. Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When I was a little girl, my mother would read stories to <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> loved books {{and going to the}} library ever since. In the summer, I liked to spend afternoons reading in the library. I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books, and many others... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life." [...] Bush has also credited her second grade teacher, Charlene Gnagy, for inspiring her interest in education.|$|E

I was restless, too, and longed to be moving about. So I sold off the furniture, paid my debts, and laid by the money that remained, for the child's use in the future.|$|R

500|$|A {{few moments}} later, Tom McLaury was carried {{from the corner}} of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. [...] Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in {{considerable}} pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, [...] "They have murdered <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air." [...] Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, [...] "Go away and let me die." [...] Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.|$|E

How {{can you say that}} money won't bring you happiness if you don't have a lot of money? How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?' You have to have that experience to know. 'Cause you have all those things, I've had all those things, and I've had nothing but chaos around me. So I'm just sharing what I know with the world. 'Cause I do think that we've become completely consumed with being rich and famous, our society has. And I just want to tell people, take it from <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. You feel when he is inside the box he hits the target." [...] Away to Southampton, {{it was the other}} signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and my confidence was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E
