In particular, when used on a silicon wafer with a < 1 1 1 > crystal orientation, excessive alloying of aluminum (from extended high temperature processing steps) with the underlying silicon can create a short circuit between the diffused FET source or drain areas under the aluminum and across the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> into the underlying substrate - causing irreparable circuit failures.

This derivation is based on solving the Poisson equation in one dimension - the dimension normal to the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction.</b> The electric field is zero outside of the depletion width (seen in above figure) and therefore Gauss’s law implies that the charge density in each region balance - as shown by the first equation in this sub-section.

40|$|Process and {{material}} {{characterization of the}} crystallization of amorphous silicon by metal-induced crystallization (MIC) and metal-induced lateral crystallization (MILC) using evaporated Ni has been performed. An activation energy of about 2 eV has been obtained for the MILC rate. The Ni content in the MILC area is about 0. 02 atomic %, {{significantly higher than the}} solid solubility limit of Ni in crystalline Si at the crystallization temperature of 500 C. A prominent Ni peak has been detected at the MILC front using scanning secondary ion mass spectrometry. The MIC/MILC interface has been determined to be highly defective, comprising a continuous grain boundary with high Ni concentration.

40|$|A pair of {{techniques}} are described which {{make use of}} the SEM to measure, respectively, the minority carrier diffusion length and the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> depth in silicon solar cells. The former technique permits the measurement of the true bulk diffusion length through the application of highly doped field layers to the back surfaces of the cells being investigated. The technique yields an absolute value of the diffusion length from a knowledge of the collected fraction of the injected carriers and the cell thickness. It is shown that the secondary emission contrast observed in the SEM on a reverse-biased diode can depict the location of the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> if the diode has been prepared with the proper beveled geometry.

40|$|Impact {{ionization}} is {{the main}} cause of the kink effect in the saturation region of the output characteristics of the field effect transistors. In thin film transistors (TFTs) the kink effect is enhanced due to the presence of traps. The larger the number of traps, the larger the kink effect at a given drain bias. It is observed that the kink effect in conventional metal induced laterally crystal-lized (cMILC) -TFTs occurs at a lower drain bias than that in solid phase crystallized (SPC) -TFTs under the same gate drive. This is shown to result from the overlapping of the MIC/MILC interface and the drain <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction.</b> Conse-quently, the kink effect can be reduced by eliminating the overlap...|$|E

Electrical simulations of the forward biased p-n junction by PICES- 2 B feature a strong dependence between the diffusion length of holes and the remaining n-type materil on p-type silicon. To demonstrate this, several wafers with different carrier concentrations were etched successfully. This method offers the possibility of adjusting the thickness of p-type silicon membranes by {{a variation of the}} carrier concentration for p- as well as for n-type silicon...|$|R
30|$|Another {{drawback}} in the down-scaling {{process of}} TFETs is to fabricate <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junctions</b> {{due to the}} need for the creation of abrupt junctions at high temperatures which is difficult and expensive [7]. This problem can be solved using junctionless TFETs (JLTFETs) [22, 23]. JLTFET uses high-doping concentrations in the drain, channel, and source. It has provided N+–I–P+ for N-JLTFETs similar to doping profile of an N-TFET using two methods. One method is the use of the charge plasma concept, wherein the desired doping profile is created by choosing appropriate workfunctions for the gates called the polarity gate (PG) located at the source region and the control gate (CG) located at the middle with a lower workfunction than PG for being a nearly intrinsic channel [24, 25, 26, 27]. As the same way, p-channel JLTFET has the similar structure [28]. Another method to create N+–I–P+ in JLTFET is using the electrically doped concept, in which P+ region underneath PG is created by applying an appropriate external bias voltage. These devices are known as EDTFET [29, 30, 31]. The other type of JLTFETs known as dopingless TFETs suppresses the need of a higher thermal budget and expensive thermal annealing technique due to refusing the physical doping [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. In this structure, the drain region is also gated for creating N+ using charge plasma or electrically doped concepts. JLTFETs also include inferior Ion and ambipolar behavior. To overcome these problems, different methods have been investigated, such as: using heterostructures at source/channel interfaces [37, 38, 39, 40, 41], the assumption of gate workfunction engineering [42, 43, 44, 45], the adoption of hetero-gate dielectrics [46, 47, 48, 49], using Gaussian-doping profiles [22, 50, 51], applying source pockets [52], the consideration of strain engineering [53, 54], using ferroelectric insulators [40], and drain workfunction engineering for DLTFET [55, 56].|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} etch-stop behaviour of ion-implanted n-type layers {{has been}} investigated {{as a function of}} the ion-implantation and post-annealing conditions. A three-electrode potentiostatic configuration and a KOH/H 2 O etch solution were used for these studies. Energy-loss spectrometry of alpha particles was applied to measure the absolute membrane thickness with an accuracy of +/- 3. 5 %. The smallest membrane thickness has been measured as 1. 15 - 1. 45 fm. The thickness investigation shows that the etch-stop takes place 1. 0 - 1. 2 fm before the implanted <b>metallurgical</b> p-n <b>junction</b> is reached, which is less than the value found by other authors. Finally, the experimental results of anisotropically and selectively etched membrane thicknesses have been compared with calculated dopant profiles, depletion layers and electrical-field distributions in the region of the p-n junction during the electrochemical etch-stop process...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{interface}} states in the Z-nO/CdS/CuinSe{sub 2 }, and CdS/CdTe solar cells are presented. The effects are investigated through numerical modeling using ADEPT (A Device Emulation Program and Tool). The results show that donor-like interface states have very little effect but acceptor-like interface states at the resistive ZnO/CdS can cause pinning of the bands at the interface, thus leading to non-exponential illuminated I-V curves when the interface state densities are high enough. High density of acceptor-like states between the CdS and In-rich CIS does not result in the two-diode like IV curves. Instead they can significantly lower the fill factor. In the CdS/CdTe solar cells. either donor- or acceptor-like interface states have little effect since almost all the depletion region lies in the CdTe. Thus, the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> where the interface states are located is away from the electrical junction where the conductivity type changes...|$|E

40|$|Luminescence {{properties}} of silicon {{light emitting diodes}} with engineered dislocation loops were investigated. Dislocation loops were formed by Si +-ion implantation above and below <b>metallurgical</b> p +-n <b>junction</b> followed by an annealing step. The diodes showed characteristic dislocation (D-band) and band-to-band luminescence. Measurements of carrier-injection level dependence of the D-band signal intensity were performed. The results are {{in agreement with the}} model for dislocation luminescence, which suggests rediative transition between two, dislocation-related shallow levels. A gradual blue-shift of the D-band peak positions was observed with an increase in the carrier injection level in electroluminescence and photoluminescence. A supposition about existence of strong Stark effect for the excitonic dislocation states allows explaining the observations. Namely, in the build-in electric field of the p-n junction the exciton energies are red-shifted. The injected charge carriers lower the field and thus cause the blue-shift of the peak positions. A fitting of the data using the quadratic Stark effect equation suggests 795 meV for the spectral position of D 1 peak at 300 K and 0. 0186 meV/(kV/cm) 2 for the characteristic constant...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} activity of threading dislocations (TDs), occurring {{in a thin}} SiGe Strain Relaxed Buffer (SRB) layer has been investigated {{by a number of}} techniques {{and its impact on the}} reverse current of p-n junction diodes has been evaluated. It is shown that besides the density of TD, there are at least two other parameters playing an important role. The distance with respect to the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> of the 5 rim C-rich layer, used for the strain relaxation and the dopant type in the well region also affect the leakage current. This complex behaviour is further reflected in the Emission Microscopy (EMMI) images, showing different breakdown sites for p+/n or n+/p junctions.

40|$|Electrical {{characteristics}} of a GaAs(p) /Si(n) interface were determined from capacitance-voltage, current-voltage, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements and compared to those on GaAs(p) epitaxial layers on GaAs(n) substrates. The comparison was made between the junctions as grown, and after an anneal at 850 C for 20 min in 10 percent forming gas under an As overpressure. For the GaAs/Si junction the ideality factor changed from 2 or larger to 1. 5 and the apparent intercept voltage changed from 2. 5 to 1. 3 V after annealing. For the GaAs homojunction, the intercept voltage increased from 1. 1 to 1. 3 V. In addition, the excess current in the forward and reverse bias conditions dropped drastically in the heterojunction. No movement of the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction</b> was discernible to within the resolution capability of SIMS. The junction properties obtained by annealing suggest an atomic restructuring of the Si(100) interface during growth or annealing.

40|$|A {{modeling}} {{technique has}} been developed which simulates a semiconductor device subjected to electrostatic discharge (ESD) stress according to the human body model (HBM). To accomplish this, a computer program was developed which solves the electron and hole continuity equations, Poisson's equation, and the heat flow equation in one dimension. The program {{has been applied to}} npn structures typical of the parasitic bipolar devices found in MOS output stages. Profiles from lightly-doped drain (LDD), double-diffused drain (DDD), and graded drain (GD) device structures were investigated. The performance of these various profiles under ESD stress has been compared in order to understand their functioning and to determine the important design parameters. It is found that device heating is reduced for structures in which the doping profile rises steeply to a high concentration in the drain region near the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction.</b> The rate of heating is related to reduced carrier saturation velocity due to local heating and its effects on charge distribution, electric field, and total potential drop across the reverse-biased junction. The modeling technique presented gives results which are in reasonable agreement with measured data. This technique should be a useful tool for evaluating new device structures, fabrication processes, or process changes before committing to the costly and time-consuming process of actual device fabrication...|$|E
40|$|This summer I am {{continuing}} {{my project}} {{from the previous}} two summers. My work involves ohmic contacts to N-type silicon carbide (Sic) devices. My mentor, Dr. Robert Okojie, is developing the technology behind high performance sensors and actuators for harsh environments. Sic is useful because {{it is able to}} operate at temperatures up to 600 C and it is resistant to radiation damage. This allows sensors and electronics to be placed in new locations, such as inside a jet engine or in space application without using heavy shielding. Ultimately this results in more efficient, smarter engine technology, reduced launch weights for spacecraft, and high power and high temperature electronics. A fundamental part of Sic devices is the ohmic contact. The contact is the interface between the semiconductor (Sic) and external circuitry. The current flowing in and out the devices is through the contact. Ensuring that these contacts remain ohmic (linear I-V behavior) allows us to fabricate devices that do not waste power at the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>junction.</b> Another key part is maintaining a low contact resistance. It is desired to maintain minimum energy loss by avoiding a rectifying electrical characteristic. My project is to develop and implement a testing procedure for measuring the contact resistance while the device is operating at high temperature. It is important to measure the contacts while simulating the true operating environment as closely as possible. For this reason, measurements are taken while the device is heated at intervals up to 600 C in air. To test the long tern reliability of the devices, the high temperature measurements are repeated after heating the sample for long intervals in air. A new set of data is gathered after heating for a total of 100, 200 and then 400 hours. The current as a function of voltage and the contact resistance was measured using the four point probe technique. The four point probe method is chosen because it measures contact resistance while eliminating error due to wire resistance and calibration issues...|$|E
