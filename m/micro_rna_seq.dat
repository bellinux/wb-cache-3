Known properties of VPA are inhibitions of histone deacetylases and activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK), which cannot fully explain VPA’s clinical features. We found that VPA induces the proteasomal degradation of DICER, a key protein {{in the generation}} of <b>micro</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Unexpectedly, the concentration of several <b>micro</b> <b>RNAs</b> increases after VPA treatment, which {{is caused by the}} upregulation of their hosting genes prior to DICER degradation.

40|$|We observe {{phenotypic}} {{variations in}} the human population every day; however, the underlying genetic mechanism behind these variations is difficult to decipher. In this project I investigate the links between phenotypic and genetic variations in humans via three different studies. First, I focus {{on the impact of}} the loss-of-function (LoF) mutations on the gene expression. To study the impact of LoF mutations on gene expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences were aligned generating a map of similarities and differences in the <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> around the LoF mutation being analyzed. The patterns of <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> alignment were studied using the Integrative Genomics Viewer and compared with the list of LoF mutations. The results from the study of LoF mutations confirmed the presence of mutations which impact the gene expression for a particular disease and also reinstated the RNA-seq data obtained. Therefore, the genetic variants present did not necessarily cause the disease in all cases and the gene was not expressed when LoF mutations were present. This RNA editing mechanism protects individuals from the expression of the LoF mutations. Second, I focus on the expression level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) -encoded genes. FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments) was used in the study of mtDNA-encoded genes to measure the relative abundance of transcripts in the <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> data. The study of mtDNA-encoded genes showed the presence of individual {{variations in the}} expression levels of the mtDNA and nuclear DNA encoded genes. I also found that the expression of nuclear genes is correlated to the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{differentiation}} {{processes are}} achieved through {{a continuum of}} hierarchical intermediate cell states that might be captured by single-cell <b>RNA</b> <b>seq.</b> Existing computational approaches {{for the assessment of}} cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data can be formalized under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (with or without a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cell clustering step). The Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such a framework.

5000|$|Coexpression {{networks}} are data-derived representations of genes behaving {{in a similar}} way across tissues and experimental conditions. Their main purpose lies in hypothesis generation and guilt-by-association approaches for inferring functions of previously unknown genes. RNASeq data has been recently used to infer genes involved in specific pathways based on Pearson correlation, both in plants [...] and mammals. The main advantage of RNASeq data in this kind of analysis over the microarray platforms is the capability to cover the entire transcriptome, therefore allowing the possibility to unravel more complete representations of the gene regulatory networks. Differential regulation of the splice isoforms of the same gene can be detected and used to predict and their biological functions. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis has been successfully used to identify co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes based on <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> data. Co-expression modules may corresponds to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs can be interpreted as representatives of their respective module.

Here, we investigated the potential of a fecal <b>micro</b> <b>RNA</b> test {{for the early}} detection of colorectal cancer. Methods: Patients with colorectal cancer (n = 299) and healthy volunteers (n = 116) with no abnormalities detected by screening colonoscopy were enrolled in this case-control study. <b>Micro</b> <b>RNA</b> expression in the colonocytes of patients with colorectal cancer (n = 47) and in healthy volunteers (n = 35) were analyzed in the training set, and the <b>micro</b> <b>RNA</b> expression in the colonocytes of patients with colorectal cancer (n = 252) and healthy volunteers (n = 81) was validated in the validation set. Results: In the training study, {{significant differences in the}} relative expression level of miR- 17 - 92 cluster, - 106 a, - 135, and - 146 a were observed between patients with colorectal cancer and healthy volunteers (P &lt; 0. 01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using miR- 17, - 18 a, - 19 a, - 19 b, - 20 a, - 92 a, - 106 a, - 135 b, and - 146 a was more than 0. 7.

40|$|Muscles are {{responsible}} for the movement of body and take up roughly half of the person’s body weight. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in human body, being controlled consciously. Skeletal muscle cells form when many smaller progenitor cells lump themselves together to constitute long, straight, multinucleated fibers. The proliferating muscle cells are called myoblasts. Myoblasts fuse together to form multinucleated non-proliferating cells called myotubes. The transition from proliferative to differentiated state involves a complete shift of the cell’s transcriptome based on a network of regulation at the molecular level. To uncover the intricacies of molecular activities involved in the process of muscle differentiation it is essential to have deeper and through understanding of the transcriptome in its entirety. <b>RNA</b> <b>seq,</b> which is a high through put sequencing technology, gives us the opportunity to reach into the deepest level of the transcriptome. By means of the <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> technology I obtained the in-depth view of the transcriptome of human muscle cells from the proliferative to the differentiated stage. The analysis was extended also to small RNAs, to have a full picture of the transcriptome. I performed the analysis with the specific objectives of identifying the expressed genes and finding out differential gene expression, of both mRNA and miRNA. I also investigated the crosstalk between mRNA and miRNA, employing two separate methods : miRNA over expression and Ago 2 immunoprecipitation followed by <b>RNA</b> <b>seq.</b> The over expression experiments were carried out with 5 different miRNAs and in all cases I found more genes turned up than turned down. These results suggest that miRNA might either have a role in mRNA stabilization or it could play a part in a double negative mechanism by inhibiting some negative factor. By comparing the genes down regulated after miRNA over expression with Ago 2 -enriched genes we have found several candidate genes which are most likely under the down regulatory control of miRNA. Skeletal muscle has enormous plasticity and can endure a lot of stress. To study this aspect of muscle we performed mechanical stretch of differentiating muscle cells. With <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> we got the in-depth view of the transcriptome as a response to stretch. We performed the analysis at two time points after stretch and found that stretch triggered immune response genes soon after, but enhanced muscle structural-protein genes expression over a prolonged course of time when the immune response takes a back seat. I believe that our thorough transcriptome analysis, including miRNA and mRNA interaction studies during myogenesis, contributes towards the better understanding of the process regulating muscle developmen...|$|R

This is called the NR2B-NR2A developmental switch, and is notable because of the different kinetics each NR2 subunit lends to the receptor. For instance, greater ratios of the NR2B subunit leads to NMDA receptors which remain open longer compared to those with more NR2A. This may in part account for greater memory abilities in the immediate postnatal period compared to late in life, which is the principle behind genetically altered 'doogie mice'.The detailed time course of this switch in the human cerebellum has been estimated using expression microarray and <b>RNA</b> <b>seq</b> and {{is shown in the}} figure on the right.|$|R
