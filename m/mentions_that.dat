5|$|Historian Alan Machado Prabhu <b>mentions</b> <b>that</b> only 11,000 {{survived the}} captivity as Christians.

According to genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely from this small group of survivors.|$|E

5|$|A legend narrates {{that the}} {{sacrificial}} cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni.

To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni's son Parashurama slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni.
