5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These places had been perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but both island residents and outsiders later came to consider that the more remote islands lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London {{about how to deal with}} the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E
50|$|Boatbuilding is a {{significant}} focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school's <b>more</b> than 30 vessels are student-built. The school had a marine railway capable of raising and lowering boats into the New Haven Harbor until it was broken by natural causes.

50|$|Assistant {{director}} to Luis Buñuel on L'Âge d'or, {{he appeared in}} more than 30 movies, using several alternate names: Jacques Borel, J.B. Brunius, Jacques-Bernard Brunius, Jacques Brunius, Brunius, J.B.Brunius. He acted in <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early, <b>more</b> political, movies of his friend Jean Renoir. He married French-English actress Cecile Chevreau in 1951. Their son Richard was born in 1956.|$|R
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as at many front-line fort.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> seriously damaged {{homes were}} of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} {{are generally more}} vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of the vault is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The vaults range from the simple quadripartite vault in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) vault at Exeter, the similar vault with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more elaborate variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar vaulting of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan vaulting of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant vaulting of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> elaborate forms are unique to England, with stellar vaulting also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E
25|$|While a young boy, Jim White {{explored}} the cavern with his homemade wire ladder. He named <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms, including the Big Room, New Mexico Room, Kings Palace, Queens Chamber, Papoose Room, and Green Lake Room. He also named <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave's <b>more</b> prominent formations, {{such as the}} Totem Pole, Witch's Finger, Giant Dome, Bottomless Pit, Fairyland, Iceberg Rock, Temple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and Rock of Ages.|$|R
50|$|At that time, {{the area}} became {{popular with the}} wealthy who built country homes, {{especially}} along the Mexico-Tacuba road and near <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Azcapotzalco. This construction was <b>the</b> forerunner <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality's <b>more</b> modern neighborhoods. In <b>the</b> first decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, rail lines were constructed, including a trolley that connected <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Azcapotzalco with Mexico City center in 1913.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{constellation}} was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} the Pendennis site {{was placed in the}} {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, and placed a greater priority on the conservation of its more modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's mess and the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} rail lines. Antananarivo is {{connected}} to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar {{is located on the}} east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used due to their remoteness. The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038. Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remote regions during rainy season road washouts.|$|E
50|$|However, {{despite its}} notoriety, Rakshastal bears no less beauty than other lakes in Tibet. Rakshastal covers a total area of 250 km2, at an {{altitude}} of 4575 m.

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> modern buildings, {{including}} Senate House and {{the newer}} {{parts of the}} HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall after funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building. Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. The buildings of St Michael's Hill were rebuilt using hundreds of old photographs to recreate the original houses. The flats at Goldney Hall were designed by Michael Grice and received an award from the Civic Trust for their design. Bristol University owns {{some of the best}} examples of Georgian architecture in the city, the best examples being Royal Fort House, Clifton Hill House and Goldney Hall despite some additions. The Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department were designed by Charles Dyer and is seen as a good example of a Greek revival movement in British architecture. The tympanum of the building depicts a scene from The Advent of Morning designed by Jabez Tyley. Its major feature was a large organ which has since been destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} trial {{for war crimes}} committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed because the United States and the Soviet Union had lost interest in prosecuting German war crimes {{with the onset of}} the Cold War. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965 eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (Totenlager) and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from Lazaret). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (Totenlager) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|There are 38 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Taunton Deane. The oldest buildings are churches built {{before the end}} of the 12th century, and the Castle Bow, which has been incorporated into the Castle Hotel in Taunton but was originally a gateway into Taunton Castle. The castle was created between 1107 and 1129, when William Giffard, the Chancellor of King Henry I, fortified the bishop's hall. It was his successor, Henry of Blois, who transformed the manor-house into a castle in 1138, during the Civil War that raged during the reign of his brother, King Stephen. Taunton is also the site of Gray's Almshouses, which dates from 1635, and a building in Fore Street from the 16th century. Most of the Grade I listed {{buildings in}} Taunton Deane are Norman or medieval era churches, many of which are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> recent structures in the list are manor houses such as Cothay Manor and Greenham Barton which were built in Stawley in the 15th century.

5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
