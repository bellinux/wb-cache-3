40|$|Reinforced {{and plain}} {{polymers}} are highly elastic. In order to measure strain of parts made of these, strain sensors {{have to be}} highly elastic too. Such sensors, certainly for cyclic loading conditions with high amplitudes, are not available. Pseudoelastic shape memory alloys are used to realise high performance strain sensors with high elasticity. These sensors can be elastically strained up to 80, 000 µm/m. In cyclic loading conditions strain levels or amplitudes of about 20, 000 µm/m are possible. The high elasticity stems from the stress-induced phase transformation of the SMA. This phase transformation involves a comparably strong specific electrical resistivity change together with long elastic strain variations. The determined gauge factor exceeds 5 and is {{higher than that of}} most of the conventional metallic strain gauges. Sensor structures can be made of wires. These can be embedded into plastics and fibre reinforced plastics. The integration of sensors is possible via injection <b>moulding,</b> <b>laminating</b> and infiltrating processes.

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to discover the screw withdrawal resistance of <b>moulded</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer lumbers made from oil palm trunks (MLVOP). The MLVOPs were manufactured separately with three different veneer arrangements namely S 100 % (each ply came from the superior part), SS-CI (surface superior and core inferior) and S-I (alternate superior and inferior parts). The veneers {{were divided into two}} groups. One group of veneers was bonded with urea formaldehyde (UF) resin to MLVOPs and the other was bonded with phenol formaldehyde (PF). The veneers were pressed at a temperature of 110 ºC for 20 min. The pressures applied to press the veneers to MLVOPs were 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi. The study showed that the pressures and S-I veneer arrangement gave significant effects to the screw withdrawal resistance of UF-bonded and PF-bonded MLVOPs. MLVOPs with S-I veneer arrangement achieved the highest mean screw withdrawal resistance values when they were bonded with UF resin then pressed with 1500 psi and 2500 psi and bonded with PF resin and pressed with 1500 psi. The values were 848 N, 884 N and 496 N respectively. Overall, UF-bonded MLVOPs were better than those bonded with PF resin. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conformal cooling {{channels}} {{follow the}} cavity shape and {{can provide a}} better cooling performance in injection <b>moulds.</b> <b>Laminated</b> tooling {{is one of the}} techniques for manufacturing injection moulds with conformal cooling systems. A laminated tool is made by stacking metal sheets of varying thicknesses from which pre–calculated profiles have been cut. The stacked sheets result in a jagged die surface that has to be finished before use. Although larger number of small thickness sheets result in small irregularities that can be finished easily, it increases the cost of profile cutting process. Therefore, one of the issues in laminated tooling is determination of sheet thicknesses so that the laminated die can be made optimally. In this paper, an optimization method is presented to find the best size of the various laminas based on CAD model surface geometry such that the surface jaggedness and the number of slice is reduced at the same time. The final mould is fabricated based on suggested optimization method. It is then tested to show the improvement in cooling performance as compared to the same die with conventional cooling channels.

40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is most used in prototype {{production and}} other processes upstream of series production. However, {{in recent years}} additive manufacturing has also moved into series production environments substituting for established systems. With AM, {{it is possible to}} improve production in terms of material consumption, manufacturing costs, and lightweight design. Accordingly, it is possible to create complexly arched <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> directly from the CAD-model instead of milling them from solid material as is frequently done for the production of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in autoclaves. This work analyses the potential of CFRP-laminating moulds as rapid tooling moulds generated by fused deposition modeling. A rounded cuboid will be considered with different reinforcement patterns as well as various wall thicknesses. Normal autoclave conditions will be simulated with pressure variation and high temperature stress varying over time. In conclusion, the results prove the capability of rapid tooling thermoplastic <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> for manufacturing CFRP components in autoclaves...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{compression}} moulding of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in the University of Nottingham, {{a number of}} studies have been carried out, trying to correlate moulding parameters with mechanical properties and microstructural void content. However, some aspects of commingled composites have received less coverage so far and are therefore dealt with in this paper. These concern the effect of the processing conditions of these materials on interlaminar shear strength and impact properties and the influence of the synergy between processing, microstructure and properties on the impact performance of commingled composite structures. With this aim, flat plaques of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites with a different fibre architecture (two-and three-dimensional) were non-isothermally compression moulded under various moulding conditions and then tested. The test programme included falling weight impact tests with a staircase procedure, Charpy impact tests and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests. To evaluate the consolidation of the laminates, void content measurement using optical microscopy was related to ILSS and impact test results. In particular, the specific issues arising in <b>moulding</b> <b>laminates</b> with added three-dimensional fibres were studied. These include correct placement of the tow, sufficient preheating of thick laminates and nesting of the layers during moulding. The results of these tests are discussed in the light of the moulding conditions and quality, and conclusions are drawn regarding optimum moulding conditions for impact performance. Finally, indications on the reliability and possible improvement of the moulding procedure to yield a sufficient moulding quality, even with large thickness, are also provided. The knowledge acquired on material consolidation properties is applied in the manufacture of an automotive side intrusion beam: problems due to the scale effect are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to study the}} suitability of oil palm trunk to be utilized as a raw material for <b>moulded</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer oil palm (MLVOP).   The trunks were converted into veneers by rotary peeling machine.   The veneers were segregated into two veneer qualities namely superior (S) and inferior (I). The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi. Two types of adhesives namely UF and PF were used to produce MLVOP. The mechanical properties of the composites were tested with three bending types i. e. flat bending, type-V bending, and type-OV in accordance with BS EN 310 : 1993. The results showed {{that most of the}} samples bonded with UF-resin have better strengths (MOR and MOE) when tested with the three bending tests compared to the samples bonded with PF-resin. However, the results vary depends on the veneer arrangements. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{capital investment}} required for large autoclaves, ovens and facilities for the processmg of large composite components creates {{a number of}} financial constraints for the development and manufacturing of larger composite aircraft products. This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using heater mats, electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) <b>laminates.</b> The <b>moulded</b> <b>laminates</b> indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products.

40|$|Regular {{composite}} production moulds {{often lack}} material and energy efficiency. These moulds either milled out of solid blocks or laminated over a master model, {{take long to}} produce and come at a high cost. In addition, the durability of <b>laminated</b> <b>moulds</b> is limited. The goal {{of this research is}} the development and technical-economical validation of faster producible, cheaper, longer lasting and material and energy efficient moulds based on plastically deformed metal sheets. Two equally spaced metal sheets are used to create a cavity through which a heat transferring fluid can flow, ensuring fast and homogenous cooling or heating resulting in reduced residual stresses in the produced composite material. Since the sheets are reasonably thin, less material has to undergo temperature changes resulting in a faster and a more energy efficient process with material-efficient moulds. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mould {{cleaning}} {{process is}} the process of removal build-up deposited or residue material on the mould surface after repeated cycles of production. The currently used mould cleaning process is sand blasting (abrasive process) and dry rubber mould cleaning compounds (depends on the skill of the operators during rubber compounding). Latex laminated compounds will be beneficial as a new substitute for mould cleaning because of its excellent strength properties and the lamination process to increase its thickness. The main focus of this research is to investigate the effect of lamination process on tensile properties and mould cleaning efficiency of laminated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) latex composites. Laminated NBR latex films with cleaning agent and waste latex compound was prepared by arranging half-cured latex sheets with various thicknesses of outer layer (NBR latex films with cleaning agent) and core layer (waste NBR latex film). The core and outer layers are prepared through casting method with different thickness. The laminated films were subjected to compression moulding using hot press at 120 oC. Reinforcement of the core layer gives laminated latex composite with better tensile properties, but excessive of core layer portion reduced the elongations of laminated films. The efficiency of <b>mould</b> cleaning of <b>laminated</b> NBR latex films were dependent on the flow ability and adhesion properties of the fresh latex layer with mould cleaning agent (outer layer) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} of raw materials, high labour costs and lengthy cycle times have limited the use of {{conventional}} ply-based composites in the automotive industry. This thesis seeks to identify the potential of using low cost discontinuous fibre composites (DFCs) for structural applications. Properties of DFCs are governed by the degree of homogeneity of the reinforcement and discontinuities at the fibre ends, which cause stress concentrations; thereby limiting the mechanical performance of the material. This work focuses on material characterisation of <b>laminates</b> <b>moulded</b> from discontinuous carbon fibre preforms manufactured by a robotic spray process. Through the culmination of this work, a suitable design methodology for automotive applications has been identified. Design procedures for aerospace have also been considered. An analytical model has been developed to determine the tensile stiffness and strength of a discontinuous carbon fibre preform composite. The model can be used within automotive and aerospace design methodologies to define material properties, {{but a number of}} other factors must be considered. Areal mass of the preform has been identified as the governing factor in achieving target compaction levels. Poor homogeneity in thin parts prevents the ability to achieve high volume fractions, which determines mechanical performance. It has been demonstrated that the matrix has a greater influence on the properties of DFCs when compared to continuous fibre composites. Toughened resins were particularly effective in improving tensile strength of DFCs that exhibited poor homogeneity. Damage tolerance of DFCs has been evaluated through open-hole and compression after impact testing. Higher property retention was observed compared to continuous fibre equivalents. Greater damage tolerance of DFCs could lead to increased weight-saving in structural applications. However, current safety factors based on conventional laminates may be too conservative and could lead to over-engineering thus limiting the potential of the material...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fibres greatly {{depends on their}} orientation {{with regard to the}} principal tensile stress direction. Consequently, the ability to control fibre orientation during casting would increase the {{effectiveness of}} fibres and reduce the necessary dosage. Understanding fibre orientation mechanisms is therefore important. The theoretical part of the thesis introduces the fibre orientation mechanisms and definitions, presents the standards and guidelines for structural design with respect to fibre orientation, and gives an overview of methods for the detection of fibre orientation and the assessment of the fibre amount and its distribution in FRC elements. The methods are divided into two groups: direct and indirect. Direct methods are based on direct observation of fibres (e. g. visual), while indirect methods include measuring values like conductivity, permeability and AC impedance which can then be related to fibre orientation or fibre amount. The experimental part of the thesis describes three cases in which fibre orientation mechanisms and the influence of formwork, reinforcement bars and element type on fibre orientation were investigated in steel-fibre-reinforced concrete slabs or walls cast from a single point. In the first case, slabs were cast using three different horizontal <b>mould</b> roughnesses: oiled <b>laminated</b> plywood, oiled ordinary wood surface, and glued sand surface. In the second case, slabs with three reinforcement bar solutions were cast: non-reinforced, unidirectionally reinforced, and grid-reinforced. In the third case, two wall elements were cast {{in order to determine the}} fibre distribution and orientation in walls and the effect of formwork tie bars. The data for analysis was obtained from small specimens. Beams were sawn from the slabs or walls in all three studies, and in the first case study cores were also drilled. The fibre orientation and distribution were characterised using the following methods: manual fibre counting at sawn cross sections, image analysis of sawn and polished cross sections, and Xray Computed Tomography (CT) with subsequent image and computer analysis, in addition to the prior numerical flow simulation used as part of the test planning. Sawn beams were also put through 3 or 4 -point bending tests. When the results from the different fibre orientation and distribution detection methods were compared, a good correlation was found between the manual fibre counting, image analysis, and CT scan analysis. The fibre orientation expressed by the fibre orientation factor and by the mean cosine of the out-of-plane angles did not correlate very well, however, because the fibre orientation factor is influenced by local variations in fibre content. The experimental results showed that the surface roughness of the formwork had considerable influence on fibre orientation, and that the reinforcement bar layout had a great influence on both fibre orientation and distribution in both vertical and horizontal directions. In the wall elements, the fibre orientation showed large variation in general, and the formwork tie bars affected local fibre distribution and orientation. The beam bending tests demonstrated the strong effect of fibre distribution and orientation on residual flexural tensile strength. The beams sawn from slabs cast in slip-surface formwork or from wall elements varied greatly in residual flexural strength, while slabs cast in moulds with a rough surface or in the presence of reinforcement bars had considerably less variation, because fibre orientation in the lower layers was much more isotropic. Comparison of residual flexural tensile strength results showed that the four-point bending test generally gave lower values than the three-point bending test in accordance with EN 14651. In recent years, there has been good progress in the development of standards and guidelines for the design and execution of SFRC, but the findings of this research are that fibre orientation needs to be incorporated in a more consistent way...|$|R
