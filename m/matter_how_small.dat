Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E

His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E

[...] The main shrine is the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Fushimi, Kyoto, Japan, where the paths up the shrine hill are marked in this fashion. [...] The kitsune statues are at times taken for a form of Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female. [...] These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw—most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common. [...] Almost all Inari shrines, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>small,</b> will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary.
