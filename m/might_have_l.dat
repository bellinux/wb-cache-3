40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to learn which factors predict who will make {{charitable}} contributions and the relative importance of these factors. The results of logistic regression showed that volunteering was the most important predictor. This supports the social responsibility norm which prescribes that help should be given to needy people even if they cannot reciprocate. Income was the second most important predictor of making charitable contributions. High income individuals <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>l</b> ~~_ considered both the costs and benefits of contributing to charitable organizations...|$|E

He <b>might</b> <b>have</b> sent <b>L.</b> Fannius or L.

50|$|A {{similar study}} {{investigating}} L. lineolaris from two geographical regions {{in terms of}} differing developmental time, fecundity, hatch rate, and survivorship was conducted. The researchers were interested in examining the reasons for L. lineolaris being a more influential pest in the Delta region {{as compared with the}} Hills region of the Mississippi. Although there were no differences found in the development time, fecundity, hatch rate, and survivorship of the L. lineolaris captured from the Delta and Hills regions, the researchers suggest that the larger area of the Delta region <b>might</b> <b>have</b> caused the <b>L.</b> lineolaris population to be subjected to more insecticides thereby having more resistance and causing more pest-related issues.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether learners of Japanese with different L 1 orthographic backgrounds differ {{from each other}} in processing Japanese words. Based on previous findings that visual information processing in L 1 varies to some extent {{depending on the type of}} orthography, it was presumed that L 1 orthographic variation <b>might</b> <b>have</b> effects on <b>L</b> 2 word processing. In the present study, English-, Chinese-, and Korean-speaking learners of Japanese performed a lexical decision task and a sentence judgment task. The target words were basic verbs written either in sound-based Hiragana letters only or in a combination of a meaning-based Kanji character and Hiragana letters. A statistical analysis indicated that Chinese-speaking learners were faster than English- and Korean-speaking learners in both orthographic conditions. There was no significant difference between English- and Korean-speaking learners. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 comments in a questionnaire about how they processed Hiragana and Kanji revealed considerable individual differences in terms of preference for either orthography. These results are discussed in terms of reliance on either phonological information or visual/orthographic information in the process of L 2 Japanese word recognition. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{outcomes}} of a project aimed at the evaluation of early English language teaching (EELT) in Dutch primary education, starting at age 4. Between 2003 and 2008 four cohorts of first- and second-grade children receiving one to three hours of English language teaching per week were tested with standardized Dutch and English versions of the Reynell tests for language development. The outcomes show that all children acquire some basic skills in English leading to a native age equivalent of 2. 5 years for comprehension and 2. 1 years for language production. First language (L 1) development is not affected by the EELT program {{in the sense that}} the majority of the children are within the age equivalent range. Furthermore, children with a non-Dutch background do not suffer from EELT {{in the sense that the}}ir L 2 Dutch development is within the normal range though significantly lower than that of their Dutch peers. It is concluded that some of the arguments against early foreign language teaching, in particular the problems it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> for <b>L</b> 1 development and the additional problems in language acquisition it could pose for non-native children, are not supported by our data. This article {{reports on the}} outcomes of a project aimed at the evaluation of early English Language Teaching (EELT) in Dutch primary education, starting at age 4. We start with a short description of the socio-political context of EELT in the European and Dutch context. Then, we discuss the main findings in the literature on the effects of EELT. Finally, we present data from five cohorts on the impact of EELT on first (L 1) and second language (L 2) development in a number of schools in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Taxonomic debates {{have been}} {{carrying}} on for decades over Formosan stag beetles, which {{consist of a}} high proportion of endemic species and subspecies featuring morphological variations associated with local adaptation. With the influence of periodical Pleistocene glaciations and the presence of several mountain ranges, the genetic differentiation and taxonomic recognition, within this medium-size island, of two endemic subspecies for each of four montane stag beetles, i. e. Lucanus ogakii, L. kanoi, Prismognathus davidis, and Neolucanus doro, has been an appealing issue. Based on monophyletic lineages and population structure, possible divergent scenarios have been proposed to clarify the subspecific status for each of the above mentioned stag beetles. Phylogenetic inferences based on COI+ 16 S rDNA+ 28 S rDNA of 240 Formosan lucanids have confirmed most species are monophyletic groups; and the intraspecific (2 %) genetic distances of the two mitochondrial genes could be applied concordantly for taxonomic identification. On account of Bayesian-based species delimitation, geographic distribution, population structure, and sequence divergences, the subspecific status for L. ogakii, L. kanoi, and Pri. davidis are congruent with their geographic distribution in this island; and the calibration time based on the mitochondrial genes shows the subspecific split events occurred 0. 7 - 1 million years ago. In addition, a more complicated scenario, i. e. genetic differentiation including introgression/hybridization events, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> occurred among <b>L.</b> ogakii, L. kanoi, and L. maculifemoratus. The geological effects of mountain hindrance accompanied by periodical glaciations could have been vital in leading to the geographical subspecific differentiation of these montane stag beetles...|$|R
