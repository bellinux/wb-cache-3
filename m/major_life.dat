He does so with so much interest that he makes <b>major</b> <b>life</b> decisions by subconsciously taking on the behaviours of characters from these films.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} <b>major</b> <b>life</b> stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

25|$|<b>Major</b> <b>life</b> {{events that}} include trauma can cause {{individuals}} to experience {{feelings of guilt}} or self-hatred. Humans {{have the ability to}} reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are moral. In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life. Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others.|$|E
25|$|In North America, and elsewhere, many congregations {{extend the}} honor of an aliyah to {{visitors}} or new members, to members who have recently attained a <b>major</b> <b>life</b> event, and to the relatives of the bar mitzvah boy. Refusing an aliyah is regarded as {{an insult to the}} Torah itself. It would be desirable that anyone who might expect such an honor would rehearse these blessings beforehand in order to do a creditable performance when the occasion occurs.|$|E
25|$|A life {{script is}} a schema that {{outlines}} cultural appropriate events that individuals should experience during {{a specific time}} period. (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004). The life script account argues that the reminiscence bump occurs because individuals use life script memories to provide a basis of recalling important memories. The life script events often contain more memories during early adulthood, or the reminiscence bump, than any other age period (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004).The life script account emphasizes norms and expectations typical of a given culture {{with regard to the}} timing of <b>major</b> <b>life</b> events. The order and timing of the major events may differ depending on the culture. The life script is a representation of the sequence of normative and <b>major</b> <b>life</b> events. Individuals know the culturally shared expectations of the order and timing of life events in a prototypical life, and are also aware of their own timing in relations to those norms. It assumes that people have an internalized culturally-aware script of the events that make up an expected, skeletal life course; this script acts as a template for the recall of life events in association with each life phase.|$|E

25|$|These {{differences}} in development appear {{to play out}} in the way young adoptees deal with <b>major</b> <b>life</b> events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees {{have been found to}} respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.|$|E
25|$|Counseling psychologists {{study and}} use {{many of the}} same {{interventions}} and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists help people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from <b>major</b> <b>life</b> changes or events. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical psychologists are trained for, such as dementia or psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, women {{raised in}} the Western world or {{developed}} countries in Asia live long enough so {{that a third of}} their life is spent in post-menopause. For some women, the menopausal transition represents a <b>major</b> <b>life</b> change, similar to menarche in the magnitude of its social and psychological significance. Although the significance of the changes that surround menarche is fairly well recognized, in countries such as the United States, the social and psychological ramifications of the menopause transition are frequently ignored or underestimated.|$|E

25|$|<b>Major</b> <b>life</b> stage {{milestones}} are {{celebrated as}} sanskara (saṃskāra, {{rites of passage}}) in Hinduism. The rites of passage are not mandatory, and vary in details by gender, community and regionally. Gautama Dharmasutras composed in about the middle of 1st millennium BCE lists 48 sanskaras, while Gryhasutra and other texts composed centuries later list between 12 and 16 sanskaras. The list of sanskaras in Hinduism include both external rituals such as those marking a baby's birth and a baby's name giving ceremony, as well as inner rites of resolutions and ethics such as compassion towards all living beings and positive attitude.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{is thrown}} into tumult, however, when Mendoza decides to forage in Laurel Canyon. The place {{is known to}} be {{saturated}} with Crome radiation from a bizarre underground quartz formation. It is this which will attract so many unusual people to the site in the 20th century, and give rise to many of the underground stories of Hollywood. Despite precautions and a lot of very futuristic equipment, Mendoza and Einar suddenly find themselves thrown forward in time to 1996. Mendoza the botanist is suddenly in urban LA, where the soil is concrete and the <b>major</b> <b>life</b> form is the automobile.|$|E
25|$|In Seascape, Nancy and Charlie, an American {{couple on}} the verge of the <b>major</b> <b>life</b> change of retirement, are having {{problems}} in their relationship. They are discussing these matters on the beach when another couple appears, two human-sized lizards named Leslie and Sarah who speak and act like people. The lizards have evolved {{to such a degree that}} they no longer feel at home in the sea and are compelled to seek life on the land. What the lizards experience with Nancy and Charlie nearly drives them back to the sea, but with an offer of help from the human couple, they decide to stay.|$|E

50|$|The epic poem King Alfred was Fitchett's <b>major</b> <b>life's</b> work. He spent {{forty years}} researching and writing it. It was printed at Warrington for private {{circulation}} at intervals between 1808 and 1834, in five quarto volumes. It {{was cast in}} the form of a romantic epic poem, the subject being the life and times of King Alfred. He did not live to finish the work, but he left money for printing a new edition, and the work of supervising it was undertaken by his friend Robert Roscoe. Roscoe completed the poem, adding 2,585 lines. The entire work contains more than 130,000 lines.|$|R
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Seascape {{is that of}} evolution and progress. This theme manifests itself in several ways in the play. One is subtle. The relationship of Nancy and Charlie {{is in the process}} of evolution. They are on the verge of a <b>major</b> <b>life</b> change, retirement. Charlie would like to use this time to rest and do nothing. Nancy sees this desire as regression rather than evolution. Her family responsibilities fulfilled, Nancy wants to explore the world, perhaps moving from beach to beach, meeting new people and having new experiences. The couple's relationship will change, and Nancy tries to move it forward. Charlie wants things to stay the same.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the <b>major</b> <b>life</b> events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{also provide}} {{psychological}} benefits to people whether they actually ride or not.

There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.|$|E
