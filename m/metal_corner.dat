There are two types of monitors: passive monitors consist of a loudspeaker and horn in a cabinet (they must be plugged into an external power amplifier); active monitors have a loudspeaker, horn and a power amplifier in a single cabinet, which means the signal from the mixing board can be plugged straight into the monitor speaker.|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{of light}} with a nanoapertured metal film {{has been the}} subject of {{extensive}} study because it produces many interesting phenomena, such as "enhanced" transmission of light through a nanohole array or shaping the spatial or spectral profiles of the transmitted light. The richness of the phenomena stems from the complexity of the way that light interacts with the nanostructures formed in the metal film. Surface plasmons (SPs), collective oscillation of electrons carrying the electromagnetic energy in the form of photons trapped at a metal/dielectric interface, can effectively mediate the interactions between metal nanostructures. Unlike the dielectric case, a metal wedge structure can also efficiently interact with free-space radiation, diffracting an incident light and/or coupling the light into surface plasmons (vice versa, decoupling surface plasmons into free-space radiation). We show that the diffraction by a <b>metal</b> <b>corner</b> plays an essential role in exciting surface plasmons and shaping energy flow distributions (enhancement or depletion). The phase relationship of the boundary diffraction and planar incident waves is extracted from measurement and simulation results. A single nanoaperture formed in a metal film is a simple and yet one of the most fundamental structures that can be viewed as a basic building block of aperture-based nano-plasmonic structures. In this study we have investigated the characteristic evolution of optical wavefronts emanating from a nanoslit formed in a thin silver film. A planar wave, directly transmitted through the thin metal film, was used as a reference in forming an interference pattern with the slit-transmitted free-space radiation and surface plasmons, and a scanning probe technique was employed in imaging the interference pattern in the near- to far-field regimes. Both the amplitude and phase information of the slit-transmitted waves with respect to the direct film-transmitted wave were extracted from the experimental data, and the results are compared with the analytical and numerical simulation results. The near- to far-field imaging of optical wavefronts is expected to be important in designing advanced nano-optic and plasmonic structures where precise control of both phase and amplitude of an optical signal is essential. We have also investigated grating diffraction with order-selection capability. This method offers a promising approach to accessing angular ranges that have not been reachable in conventional optics and to overcoming the limits of conventional refractive optics...|$|E

Improving light absorption, on both spatial and spectral domains, is a critical requirement in most PV cell designs. In thin-film solar cells, in particular, light usually is not completely absorbed in single pass transmission through the active layer, therefore proper ‘management’ of incident photons is particularly important. Plasmonic nanostructures can play a versatile role in mediating light-matter interactions, e. g., enhancing the scattering cross-sections (metal nanoparticles), concentrating the near field intensity (<b>metal</b> <b>corners</b> and nanoapertures) and coupling of light into waveguide modes (nanogratings), potentially beneficial for enhancing light absorption. In the study, optical properties of metal island thin films were characterized. Metal nano-islands were formed by performing thermal annealing of Ag films deposited on silica surface.
