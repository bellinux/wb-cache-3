40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that statistical properties of storm rainfall at a location and within a homogeneous season have a well-structured dependence on storm duration. To explain this dependence, a simple scaling model for rainfall intensity within a storm was hypothesized. It was shown both analytically and empirically that such a model can explain reasonably well the observed statistical structure {{in the interior of}} storms providing thus an efficient parameterization of storms of varying durations and total depths. This simple scaling model is also consistent with, and provides a theoretical basis for, the concept of <b>mass</b> <b>curves</b> (normalized cumulative storm depth vs. normalized cumulative time since the beginning of a storm) which are extensively used in hydrologic design.

40|$|The use {{of design}} storms {{can be very}} useful in many {{hydrological}} and hydraulic practices. In this study, {{the concept of a}} copula-based secondary return period in combination with the concept of <b>mass</b> <b>curves</b> is used to generate design storms. The analysis is based on storms selected from the 105 year rainfall time series with a 10 min resolution, measured at Uccle, Belgium. In first instance, bivariate copulas and secondary return periods are explained, together with a focus on which couple of storm variables is of highest interest for the analysis and a discussion of how the results might be affected by the goodness-of-fit of the copula. Subsequently, the fitted copula is used to sample storms with a predefined secondary return period for which characteristic variables such as storm duration and total storm depth can be derived. In order to construct design storms with a realistic storm structure, <b>mass</b> <b>curves</b> of 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th quartile storms are developed. An analysis shows that the assumption of independence between the secondary return period and the internal storm structure could be made. Based on the <b>mass</b> <b>curves,</b> a technique is developed to randomly generate an intrastorm structure. The coupling of both techniques eventually results in a methodology for stochastic design storm generation.

The contributions of climate changes and human activities to runoff were analyzed using rainfall-runoff relationship, double <b>mass</b> <b>curve,</b> slope variation, and water balance method during 1961 – 2010 at the Jinsha River basin, China. Results indicate that runoff at upstream and runoff at midstream are both dominated by climate changes, and the contributions of climate changes to runoff are 63 %~ 72 % and 53 %~ 68 %, respectively. At downstream, climate changes account for only 13 %~ 18 %, and runoff is mainly controlled by human activities, contributing 82 %~ 87 %.

When doing hydrologic {{analyses}} in {{very small}} drainage {{areas such as}} small urban stormwater catchments, airport runways, or professional sports fields where the time of concentration is short (e. g. < 10 minutes), {{it is important to}} have rainfall data with a short enough time-interval to adequately observe the temporal distribution and accurately model the resulting infiltration and runoff. When the time-interval gets very small, such as 1 -minute intervals, the traditional hyetograph technique of using a histogram to graph rainfall intensity as a function of time does not accurately represent the storm event. A new method to calculate and graph rainfall intensities was developed to address these problems by allowing the time-interval over which the intensity is calculated to vary while holding the depth-interval constant. This new variable-time method was then evaluated with three numerical differentiation techniques (forward-difference, central-difference, and three-point forward-difference) that were used to differentiate the rainfall <b>mass</b> <b>curve</b> to estimate intensities. The variable-time method proved to be a viable alternative, especially for graphically based analyses. The central-difference method is a good alternative to generate a continuous intensity function although it has the potential to underestimate the intensity of sudden short burst of rainfall. This does not occur with the forward-difference method but it does result in an overall shift of the data by one time-interval. Even though the three-point forward-difference method uses a higher order approximation of the <b>mass</b> <b>curve,</b> it proved to be the least preferred alternative because it was unable to realistically deal with sudden changes in the <b>mass</b> <b>curve.</b> Civil Engineerin...|$|E

ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric <b>mass</b> <b>curve</b> (TG—thermogravimetry), derivative thermogravimetric <b>mass</b> <b>curve</b> (DTG), and heat flow (HF)) and model-free kinetics were chosen as investigational tools.

In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity–duration–frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23 ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i. e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall–streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36 min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2 – 3 year period (2003 – 2005) were analysed.

40|$|Given the inflow-hydrograph and {{characteristics}} of a reservoir, to estimate the maximum outflow rate. The method here proposed {{to solve this problem}} is {{based on the fact that}} at the time of maximum outflow rate the outflow rate is equal to the inflow rate. Let the equation of continuity governing the time-storage relation be : f (z) dzdt=Q (t) - q (z), where z = elevation of water level in reservoir, f (z) = surface area of reservoir, t=time, Q(t) =infIow rate, q(z) =outf 1 ow rate. Integrating between the limits, t = 0 and t = h (the instant of maximum outflow rate) we have F(z_h) - F(z_ 0) =int_ 0 ^h Q(t) dt -int_ 0 ^h q(z) dt, where F’(z) =f(z), and z_h, z_ 0 are the values of z at t=h, t = 0 respectively. On the assumption that q (z) is representable with sufficient closeness by a quartic in t, having 2 nd-order contact with q (z) at t = 0 and 1 st-order contact at t = h, we get int 0 ^h q(z) =(h/ 5) (3 q(z_ 0) + 2 Q(h)) +(h^ 3 / 60) q’(z_ 0) Q’(o) /f(z_ 0), provided Q(a) =q(z_ 0). Hence F(Z_h) - F(z_ 0) = int 0 ^h Q(t) dt - (h/ 5) (3 q(z_ 0) + 2 Q(h)) - (h^ 3 /(60) q 2 ̆ 7 (z_ 0) Q 2 ̆ 7 (o) /f(z_ 0) and Q(h) =q(z_h). If the last term in the first of these equations is neglected, they can conveniently be solved for h with the aid of a chart. Take a pair of rectangular axes and draw the inflow <b>mass</b> <b>curve</b> with the horizontal axis as time axis. Graduate the vertical axis so that the graduation zon it is at a distance F(z) -F(z_ 0) from the origin, and draw through z two straight lines with angular coefficients q(z) and 0. 6 q(z_ 0) + 0. 4 q(z) respectively. The forn 1 er set of lines shall be called the first outflow lines and the latter set the second outflow lines.

While this is a graphical and empirical method {{with a high degree of}} subjectivity, there exist more objective and statistically sound versions. However, all versions tacitly rely on the assumption that precipitation is independent in time over long (e. g. annual) time scales. On the other hand, long precipitation time series reveal that they may exhibit long-range dependence, also known as the Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) behaviour. A simulation study is performed, which shows that under HK behaviour different slopes appearing in the double <b>mass</b> <b>curve</b> are regular and do not necessarily indicate data inconsistency or inhomogeneity. Thus, application of the routine method to correct the data in fact modifies correct measurements, which are rendered inconsistent.

Similar concerns exist in the Wei River basin {{which is the largest}} tributary of the Yellow River basin and comprises the highly eroded Loess Plateau. Better understanding of the drivers of stream flow and sediment discharge dynamics in the Wei River basin is needed for development of effective management strategies for the region and entire Yellow River basin. In this regard we analysed long term trends for water and sediment discharge during the flood season in the Wei River basin, China. Stream flow and sediment discharge data for 1932 to 2008 from existing hydrological stations located in two sub-catchments and at two points in the Wei River were analysed. Precipitation data were analysed from corresponding meteorological stations. We identified change points or transition years for the trends by the Pettitt method and, using double <b>mass</b> <b>curves,</b> we diagnosed whether they were caused by precipitation changes, human intervention, or both. We found significant decreasing trends for stream flow and sediment discharge during the flood season in both sub-catchments and in the Wei River itself. Change-point analyses further revealed that transition years existed and that rapid decline in stream flow began in 1968 (PPPPP< 0. 05), respectively. The impact of precipitation or human activity on the reduction amount after the transition years was estimated by double <b>mass</b> <b>curves</b> of precipitation vs stream flow (sediment). For reductions in stream flow and sediment discharge, the contribution rate of human activity was found to be 82. 80 % and 95. 56 %, respectively, and was significantly stronger than the contribution rate of precipitation.

Knowing how spin and charge curve space we extend Einstein's field equation to become an equation of both energy/momentum and charge/current. This equation becomes a macroscopic/microscopic equation of the physical reality. Charge and angular momentum are quantized and thus we expect curvature of spacetime, on the microscopic level, to be also quantized. Part 1 of this paper presents our model of an elementary particle that yields the axiomatic laws of Newton, the attribute of inertia and shows mass to be merely a practicality. It also shows how an elementary particle senses curvature and moves accordingly. This enables us to prove the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass, whereas here we prove that gravitational mass is the inertial mass...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that statistical properties of storm rainfall within a homogeneous season have a well-structured dependence on storm duration. For example, the {{mean and standard deviation}} of total storm depth increase with duration each according to a power law with the same exponent; the lag-one correlation coefficient of hourly rainfall depths increases with duration; and the decay rate of the autocorrelation function of hourly rainfall depths decreases with duration. Motivated by the first observation, a simple scaling model for rainfall intensity within a storm was hypothesized and was shown both analytically and empirically that such a model can explain reasonably well the observed statistical structure in the interior of storms providing thus an efficient parameterization of storms of varying durations and total depths. This simple scaling model is also consistent with, and provides a theoretical basis for, the concept of <b>mass</b> <b>curves</b> (normalized cumulative storm depth vs. normalized cumulative time since the beginning of a storm) which are extensively used in hydrologic design...|$|R
