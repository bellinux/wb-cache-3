5|$|After Mitag struck Yap, the state's {{governor}} {{declared a}} 30‑day {{state of emergency}} and asked for aid from the national government. On May29, United States President George W. Bush declared a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> for Yap, which allocated funding for repairing storm damage and storm damage mitigation. Crop damage from Mitag caused food shortages in Yap and Chuuk, and health problems related to the storm killed one person on Nomwin. Residents and businesses in Palau sent $3,000 in donations and other relief supplies to Yap, as well as $3,000 worth of oil. The state government sent about $2,000 to storm victims. Hospitals in Guam sent medical teams to Yap with blankets, clothing, and medical supply.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E

5|$|Isa first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95km/h (60mph). The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops. After {{the passage of the}} typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 {{members of}} the National Guard to partner with 200 law {{enforcement}} officers along Mississippi's coast in minimizing crime, and nighttime curfews were established in several cities. On September 4, President Reagan declared Mississippi's coastal counties a <b>Major</b> <b>Disaster</b> area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated {{that as many as}} 3,000 homes in the state were uninhabitable, their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements. The Small Business Administration approved special loans up to $500,000 for owners of damaged businesses. Mississippi Power Company's system was the hardest-hit, and restoration of service was slow; 50,000 of 80,000 customers were still without electricity by September 5.|$|E
5|$|On May22, a {{day after}} the typhoon struck the island, U.S. President Gerald Ford {{declared}} Guam a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> area. In September 1976, the United States Senate passed a bill that included aid for the storm victims. Ultimately, the U.S. government provided $200million in aid and reconstruction funding in the two years following the typhoon's passage. This included about $80million to repair Guam's military facilities, which took several years to complete. Following the typhoon's passage and through the 1980s, the island's wooden homes underwent the process of being replaced by safer concrete homes.|$|E

Bush signed a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> {{declaration}} for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan program.|$|E
5|$|Threatening {{much of the}} East Coast of the United States, {{hurricane}} warnings {{were issued}} from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. A total of 12people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100million. Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> areas by then-President Gerald Ford. Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Isabel made landfall, President George W. Bush {{issued a}} <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> {{declaration}} for 26 North Carolina counties, which allowed {{the use of}} federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. The declaration also allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, {{as well as providing}} federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, {{large-scale}} search and rescue operations took place in the affected areas. A <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> declaration was signed by President Bill Clinton the following day (May 4), allowing for the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. In light of the fatalities that occurred under highway overpasses, the notion of them being safe areas to seek shelter was dismissed, and they were from then on considered {{to be one of the}} most dangerous places to be during a tornado. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. In May 2013, similar areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track were again devastated by an EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area.|$|E
5|$|Leftover waters {{from the}} storm led to an {{increase}} in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane. On July1, the flood areas of southern Texas were declared a <b>major</b> <b>disaster</b> area. This followed a delivery of 2flood specialists, 20laborers, 2portable water treatment plants, 7trucks, and a quantity of insecticides and water treatment tablets. Residents in Laredo, Texas provided citizens of its neighboring city Nuevo Laredo, Mexico with food and water. The Mexican government provided temporary homes for the affected citizens of the flood. American officials distributed typhoid vaccinations, water purification tablets, and insecticides to the American cities along the Rio Grande. Safe water was eventually restored to Laredo, Texas on July12. All emergency work related to the disaster was finished by September3.|$|E
