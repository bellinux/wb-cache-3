Some of his most memorable sketches included vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot, getting [...] "attacked" [...] by actors in large animal costumes, or Leno would discover Hall [...] "missing" [...] from the studio and would go in search of him - eventually finding Edd in a ridiculous place or situation.|$|E

He participated in this program and was involved in the design, build, test and racing of the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 vehicles. He served as project manager for the 2006 and 2008 vehicles, the latter of which placed 4th at the Formula SAE West competition in Fontana, CA. At the 2006 Fontana competition, Zemke made a connection with Jay Leno than led to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Leno</b> inviting the MSU Formula SAE Team to his Big Dog Garage in Burbank, CA for an expose` on the Formula SAE competition. Zemke remains a strong supporter of Formula SAE, serving as Presentation Event Captain and a member of the organizing committee for the competition held annually in Michigan.

We may here add that the Chevalier de Chatelaine, the able French translator of Chaucer and Shakespeare, has not deemed this song of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Leno's</b> beneath his dignity; for he has rendered it familiar to his countrymen in a translation of uncommon excellence."

500|$|In 1865, Leno and {{his brother}} Henry, who first taught Leno to dance, formed a clog dancing double act known as [...] "The Great Little Lenos". [...] This {{was the first time}} that Leno used his stepfather's stage name, [...] "Leno", which he never {{registered}} legally. The same year, Leno also appeared in his first pantomime, in Liverpool, where he had a supporting part as a juvenile clown in Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap alongside his parents, who appeared as [...] "Mr and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Leno</b> – Comic Duettists". On 18 July 1866, Leno, Henry and their parents appeared on the opening night of the Cambridge Music Hall in Toxteth, Liverpool, under the billing [...] "Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Leno,</b> the Great, Sensational, Dramatic and Comic Duettists and The Brothers Leno, Lancashire Clog, Boot and Pump Dancers". The following year, the brothers made their first appearance without their parents at the Britannia music hall in Hoxton. Although initially successful, the pair would experience many bouts of unemployment and often busked outside London pubs to make a living. Tired of surviving on little or no money, Henry left the clog dancing act to take up a trade in London, forcing Leno to consider a future as a solo performer. Henry later founded a dance school. Soon, however, Henry was replaced intermittently in the act by the boys' uncle, Johnny Danvers, who was a week older than Leno. Leno and Danvers were close from an early age.|$|R
500|$|Leno's first theatre {{appearance}} (as {{distinguished from}} music hall) was in pantomime in Liverpool in 1865, {{where he had}} a supporting part as a juvenile clown in Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap alongside his parents, who appeared as [...] "Mr and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Leno</b> – Comic Duettists". [...] Leno earned wider theatrical notice as Dame Durden in a pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk at London's Surrey Theatre in 1886, having been spotted singing [...] "Going to Buy Milk" [...] by the theatre's manager. [...] The piece was a success, and Leno received rave reviews; as a result, he was booked to star as Tinpanz the Tinker in the following year's pantomime, Sinbad and the Little Old Man of the Sea; or, The Tinker, the Tailor, the Soldier, the Sailor, Apothecary, Ploughboy, Gentleman Thief. [...] The Era reported that Leno [...] "made a capital Tinker, full of drollery and grotesque business." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} of The Late Shift for The New York Times Book Review, Jon Katz wrote, [...] "This is a reporter's book, unfailingly balanced, {{thoroughly}} researched, filled with scoops and fresh details. Even though CBS's wooing and winning of Mr. Letterman {{was the subject of}} enormous publicity, Mr. Carter's book makes clear that we knew less than we thought about what was really going on." [...] Katz criticized the book for not going into more depth about Letterman's switch to CBS, writing, [...] "As readable as it is, 'The Late Shift' needed to take a more critical, detached look at the long-term significance of Mr. Letterman's move. A number of questions are not addressed." [...] He concluded, [...] "'The Late Shift' is nonetheless a powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Leno,</b> who has been made to seem a second choice by the very people who elevated him, has been betrayed by his employers in the most basic of ways, and he has not yet recovered." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1870, the Lenos {{appeared}} in another pantomime by Leno's father, Jack the Giant Killer; or, Harlequin Grim Gosling, or the Good Fairy Queen of the Golden Pine Grove, in which Leno played {{the title character}} and also featured in the variety entertainment that preceded the pantomime. [...] This was his last theatrical role until 1886. [...] Throughout the 1870s, Leno and his parents performed as [...] "The Comic Trio (<b>Mr.</b> & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Leno</b> and Dan Patrick) In Their Really Funny Entertainments, Songs and Dances". [...] In the family act with his parents and Danvers, young Leno often took the leading role in such sketches as his stepfather's The Wicklow Wedding. [...] Another of their sketches was Torpedo Bill, in which Leno played the title role, an inventor of explosive devices. His parents played a [...] "washerwoman" [...] and a [...] "comic cobbler". This was followed by another sketch, Pongo the Monkey. Opening at Pullan's Theatre of Varieties in Bradford on 20 May 1878, this burlesque featured Leno as an escaped monkey; it became his favourite sketch of the period.|$|R
5000|$|In the pantomimes, Leno and Campbell {{would often}} deviate from the script, improvising freely. Some critics, {{including}} the writer E. L. Blanchard {{felt that the}} employment of music-hall performers was corrupting pantomime. However, the public felt differently, regarding the Drury Lane spectaculars as the pinnacle of Christmas entertainment. This view was also shared by critics, one of whom wrote: [...] I am inclined to think [...] "the cake" [...] for frolicsome humour is taken by the dapper new-comer, <b>Mr.</b> Dan <b>Leno,</b> who is sketched as the galvanic baroness in the wonderfully amusing dance which sets the house in a roar. The substantial 'babes', Mr. Herbert Campbell and Mr. Harry Nicholls, would have no excuse {{if they did not}} vie in drollery with the light footed Dan Leno. Among the productions were: Babes in the Wood (1888), Jack and the Beanstalk (1889 and 1899), Beauty and the Beast (1890 and 1900), Humpty Dumpty (1891 and 1903), Little Bo-peep (1892), Robinson Crusoe (1893), Dick Whittington and His Cat (1894), Cinderella (1895), Aladdin (1896) and the Forty Thieves (1898).|$|R
500|$|Sinbad brought Leno to the {{attention}} of Augustus Harris, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, one of the largest London theatres, which staged elaborate pantomime spectacles every Christmas. [...] Harris offered Leno a role in the theatre's 1888 Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood. One critic wrote that [...] "'the cake' for frolicsome humour is taken by the dapper new-comer, <b>Mr.</b> Dan <b>Leno,</b> who is sketched as the galvanic baroness in the wonderfully amusing dance which sets the house in a roar. The substantial [...] "babes", Mr. Herbert Campbell and Mr. Harry Nicholls, would have no excuse if they did not vie in drollery with the light footed Dan Leno." [...] Babes was a triumph: the theatre reported record attendance, and the run was extended until 27 April 1889. Leno went on to star in a total of 16 Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane from 1888 to 1904. In 15 of these, he played alongside Herbert Campbell, a veteran pantomime performer, with Leno playing predominantly dame roles. Leno became famous for his characterisations of dame roles, and he was described as the [...] "precursor of contemporary pantomime dames".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} about Christmas time," [...] he said. [...] "We were {{discussing}} the Drury Lane Pantomime--some {{three or four of}} us--in the smoking room of the Devonshire Club, and young Gold said he thought it would prove a mistake, the introduction of a subject like the Fiscal question into the story of Humpty Dumpty. The two things, so far as he could see, {{had nothing to do with}} one another. He added that he entertained a real regard for <b>Mr.</b> Dan <b>Leno,</b> whom he had once met on a steamboat, but that there were other topics upon which he would prefer to seek that gentleman's guidance. Nettleship, on the other hand, declared that he had no sympathy with the argument that artists should never intrude upon public affairs. The actor was a fellow citizen with the rest of us. He said that, whether one agreed with their conclusions or not, one must admit that the nation owed a debt of gratitude to Mrs. Brown Potter and to Miss Olga Nethersole for giving to it the benefit of their convictions. He had talked to both ladies in private on the subject and was convinced they knew as much about it as did most people.|$|R
5000|$|After these {{pantomime}} performances proved {{popular with}} audiences, Leno {{was hired in}} 1888 by Augustus Harris, manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to appear in that year's Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood. Harris's pantomime productions at the huge theatre were known for their extravagance and splendour. Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, acrobats, marionettes and animals, and included an elaborate transformation scene and an energetic harlequinade. Often they were partly written by Harris. Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls starred with Leno in the next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. Campbell {{had appeared in the}} theatre's previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those productions, E. L. Blanchard. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas pantomimes. This was not a view shared by audiences or the critics, one of whom wrote: [...] I am inclined to think [...] "the cake" [...] for frolicsome humour is taken by the dapper new-comer, <b>Mr.</b> Dan <b>Leno,</b> who is sketched as the galvanic baroness in the wonderfully amusing dance which sets the house in a roar. The substantial [...] "babes", Mr. Herbert Campbell and Mr. Harry Nicholls, would have no excuse if they did not vie in drollery with the light footed Dan Leno.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Sebastian Paul (educated at Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kerala) {{made his}} electoral {{debut in the}} 1997 Lok Sabha byelection in Ernakulam (Lok Sabha constituency) when he {{defeated}} Antony Isaac of the INC. The byelection was necessitated by {{the demise of the}} sitting MP, Xavier Arackal. In 1998, he unsuccessfully contested against George Eden, conceding a margin of nearly 75,000 votes. In the same year, in the byelections to the Assembly (caused by the resignation of George Eden who was the sitting MLA) from the Ernakulam constituency, <b>Mr.</b> Paul defeated <b>Leno</b> Jacob of the Congress and {{was a member of the}} Assembly for three years. In the 2001 Assembly elections, he was defeated by Prof. K V Thomas by a margin of 11,844 votes. In the byelection held in 2003 September (caused by the demise of George Eden) to Parliament, Dr. Paul notched up victory by a margin of 23,000 votes over M.O. John in an election that witnessed the nadir of group politics of the Congress and the UDF. In the 2004 general election, he defeated the Congress candidate by a margin of 70,099 votes.|$|R
2500|$|George Edwardes {{organised}} a gala {{benefit for}} Farren at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 17 March 1898. The star-studded event, attended by a standing-room only crowd of 3,000people (including her long-time fan, the Prince of Wales), lasted six hours. It included {{a performance of}} Trial by Jury in which W. S. Gilbert played the Associate and Effie Bancroft played the [...] "Associate's Wife", the barristers were all playwrights, the jury included many well-known comic actors, the bridesmaids included well-known leading ladies of the day mixed with real chorus girls from the Gaiety; a huge [...] "crowd in court" [...] made up of D'Oyly Carte Opera Company principals and other actors was also assembled. Principals included Barrington, Pounds, Lewis, Passmore, Lytton and Perry. Also given was the premiere of a J. M. Barrie playlet, [...] "A Platonic Friendship". Kate Vaughan danced, after an absence from the stage of twelve years. Henry Irving recited The Dream of Eugene Aram, Ellen Terry played Ophelia, Chevalier sang <b>Mrs.</b> Hawkins, Dan <b>Leno</b> gave Hamlet, Marie Tempest sang [...] "The Jewel of Asia", and Hayden Coffin sang [...] "Tommy Atkins." [...] In a pantomime, Ellaline Terriss played the Fairy Queen, Letty Lind played Columbine, Arthur Roberts was a policeman, and Edmund Payne was the clown. Marie Lloyd and several music hall stars danced, Coffin appeared again, and Farren herself was discovered on stage with Charles Wyndham. Marie Bancroft, Lydia Thompson, Kate Santley, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, John Hare, Clara Butt, and many other famous actors performed, as did the choruses of The Geisha, The Circus Girl and other popular shows. Barely able to walk {{with the aid of}} crutches, Farren said a few words and made a joke. The benefit raised an estimated £7,000 (...) for her retirement.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have stepped}} {{on one side}} from the {{immediate}} subject because this is as good an instance as any {{we are likely to}} come across of a certain almost extraneous fault which does deface the work of Bernard Shaw. It is a fault only to be mentioned when we have made the solidity of the merits quite clear. To say that Shaw is merely making game of people is demonstrably ridiculous; at least a fairly systematic philosophy can be traced through all his jokes, and one would not insist on such a unity in all the songs of <b>Mr.</b> Dan <b>Leno.</b> I have already pointed out that the genius of Shaw is really too harsh and earnest rather than too merry and irresponsible. I shall have occasion to point out later that Shaw is, in one very serious sense, the very opposite of paradoxical. In any case if any real student of Shaw says that Shaw is only making a fool of him, we can only say that of that student it is very superfluous for anyone to make a fool. But though the dramatist's jests are always serious and generally obvious, he is really affected from time to time by a certain spirit of which that climate theory is a case--a spirit that can only be called one of senseless ingenuity. I suppose it is a sort of nemesis of wit; the skidding of a wheel in the height of its speed. Perhaps it is connected with the nomadic nature of his mind. That lack of roots, this remoteness from ancient instincts and traditions is responsible for a certain bleak and heartless extravagance of statement on certain subjects which makes the author really unconvincing as well as exaggerative; satires that are saugrenu, jokes that are rather silly than wild, statements which even considered as lies have no symbolic relation to truth. They are exaggerations of something that does not exist. For instance, if a man called Christmas Day a mere hypocritical excuse for drunkenness and gluttony that would be false, but it would have a fact hidden in it somewhere. But when Bernard Shaw says that Christmas Day is only a conspiracy kept up by poulterers and wine merchants from strictly business motives, then he says something which is not so much false as startlingly and arrestingly foolish. He might as well say that the two sexes were invented by jewellers who wanted to sell wedding rings. Or again, take the case of nationality and the unit of patriotism. If a man said that all boundaries between clans, kingdoms, or empires were nonsensical or non-existent, that would be a fallacy, but a consistent and philosophical fallacy. But when Mr. Bernard Shaw says that England matters so little that the British Empire might very well give up these islands to Germany, he has not only got hold of the sow by the wrong ear but the wrong sow by the wrong ear; a mythical sow, a sow that is not there at all. If Britain is unreal, the British Empire must be a thousand times more unreal. It is as if one said, [...] "I do not believe that Michael Scott ever had any existence; but I am convinced, in spite of the absurd legend, that he had a shadow." ...|$|R
