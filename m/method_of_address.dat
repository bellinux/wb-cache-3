5000|$|A deacon is not styled [...] "Father" [...] as {{a priest}} would be, but as [...] "Deacon", (in Spanish, [...] "Diácono") {{abbreviated}} variously as [...] "Dn." [...] or [...] "Dcn." [...] This preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> is stated in the A.D. 2005 document of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States. The proper address in written correspondence for all Deacons of the Latin (Roman Rite) Catholic Church in the United States is [...] "Deacon Name", {{although it is not}} uncommon to see [...] "Rev. Mr." [...] sometimes used. [...] "Rev. Mr.", however, is more often used to indicate a transitional deacon (i.e., preparing for ordination to the priesthood) or one who belongs to a religious institute, while Rev. Deacon is used as the honorific for permanent deacons in many dioceses (e.g. Rev. Deacon John Smith, or Deacon John Smith). The decision as to whether deacons wear the Roman collar as street attire is left to the discretion of each bishop for his own diocese. Where clerical garb is approved by the bishop, the deacon can choose to wear or not wear the [...] "collar". Where it is not permitted, the deacon must wear secular clothing. It is becoming more common to see deacons wearing a clerical suit especially in prisons and jails.|$|E

The use of an internal multiplier of FPGA and the sharing of resources for quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16 -quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), and 64 -QAM modulations along with all possible code rates makes our approach to be novel and highly efficient when compared with conventional look-up table-based approach.

A network of such nodes can coordinate among themselves for distributed sensing and processing of certain phenomena. In this paper, we propose an architecture to provide a stateless solution in sensor networks for efficient addressing and routing. We name our architecture TreeCast. We propose a unique <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> allocation, building up multiple disjoint trees which are geographically intertwined and rooted at the data sink. Using these trees, routing messages {{to and from the}} sink node without maintaining any routing state in the sensor nodes is possible. Next, we use this address allocation method for scoped addressing, through which sensor nodes of a particular type or in a particular region can be targeted. Evaluation of our protocol using ns- 2 simulations shows how well our addressing and routing schemes perform...|$|E

40|$|Postal address {{management}} in e-commerce {{is the process}} of ensuring that all name and postal address data held by online businesses is up-to-date, accurate, easy-to-use and, probably most important, applicable in international business processes. There are many problems associated with name and address data in e-commerce checkout procedures. Determining whether shipping and billing addresses are valid is now a major business inhibitor. The xNAL based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> management presented in this paper at the point of interaction with the customer (checkout procedure on website or call-center) virtually eliminates the possibility of entering wrong name and address data- all name and address data are validated against data supplied by the national postal authorities. On the other side, this semantic Web-ready solution provides the information available over the Web in a way understandable not only by humans but by computers too; this will allow a broad range of e-commerce and postal solutions to use the Web not only for displaying information as today do, but for more “intelligent ” purposes, supporting sharing and reusing data across different applications and businesses, like track-and-trace or direct mail. 1...|$|E

To carry on experiments the model of the network operating system has been extended adding a model of environment demands.

The simulation tool presented here has been developed on the basis of a logical model of the network operating system constructed earlier [Gos 86]. The tool described in this paper could be treated as a basic one because it is possible to use many parts of it to construct other tools making possible simulation studies of other problems of network operating system (e. g., the effectiveness of distribution of resource management, synchronization).
