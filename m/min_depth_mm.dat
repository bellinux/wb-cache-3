Solar energy has been always concern researchers to develop most effective, durable and cheap methods and materials {{to be used as}} solar energy collectors in road pavements. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the maximum heat area using ethylene glycol. The study was involved the field monitoring of the six samples of asphalt slab with stainless steel pipe with ethylene glycol and empty pipe act as the controlled sample. The pipe was arranged in three different <b>depths</b> of 50 <b>mm,</b> 100 mm and 150 mm and keeping controlled the pipe diameter and the size of slab of 20 mm and 300 mm x 300 mm respectively.

40|$|Background and Aim: Insufficient {{polymerization}} of resin cements is {{of considerable}} clinical importance, because of mechanical deficiencies and biological {{side effects of}} uncured resin. Dual cure resin cements are getting popular in luting tooth colored posts and although their curing is claimed to proceed chemically, polymerization efficiency in deep areas of canal is uncertain. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate degree of polymerization of dual-cure resin cements used for luting translucent and opaque fiber posts in different distances from the light tip. Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, degree of conversion of two dual cured resin cements, Rely X ARC (3 M, ESPE) and Nexus 2 (Kerr, USA) were measured when used with DT-Light and DT-White posts (RTD, France). The light curing unit used was Optilux 501, with output of 650 - 700 mw/cm 2 with emitting time of 60 seconds. Degree of conversion was measured in three different depths (4, 6, 8 mm) by FTIR. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Post hoc tests. P 0. 05). Nexus used with DT-Light had lower DC% in 8 <b>mm</b> <b>depth</b> (P< 0. 05). Nexus used with DT-White showed lower DC% in 8 <b>mm</b> <b>depth</b> compared to 4 <b>mm</b> <b>depth.</b> The control groups of both cements showed significant increased DC% in 4 <b>mm</b> <b>depth</b> compared to 6 and 8 <b>mm</b> <b>depths</b> (P< 0. 05).

DT-Light increased DC% of Nexus in 6 and 8 <b>mm</b> <b>depths,</b> compared to DT-White and control groups. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, application of translucent fiber posts has a significant effect on degree of polymerization in dual-cure resin cements, compared to opaque types. Their better light transmission to deep areas due to the effect of optical fibers, can lead to better results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the application of}} the incremental slitting technique for residual stress measurement to plastically deformed four-point bent beams and autogenously edge welded steel beams. Initially a study into a number of factors affecting the series expansion approach was conducted. Due to the over-determined nature of the series expansion approach appropriate selection of polynomial series order was necessary to develop the best prediction. The effect of elasto-plastic properties in experimental situations creates local slit tip yielding which could led to errors particularly at shallow depths and in near slit gauges. The specimens used for the plastic four-point bending were manufactured from ferritic steel with dimensions of width 10 <b>mm,</b> <b>depth</b> 25 <b>mm</b> and length 250 mm. These experiments were conducted to create {{a better understanding of the}} incremental slitting procedure and its experimental application. The measured stresses were found to be in reasonable agreement with the FE predictions. A set of autogenously welded ferritic beams of width 10 <b>mm,</b> <b>depth</b> 50 <b>mm</b> and length 180 mm were also measured. These beams were edge welded to create a through depth residual stress field. Residual stress measurements for two different weld torch speeds were obtained.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{proposed}} a new technique for visualising trabecular architecture of spongy bone using ultrasound A-mode signals from a transducer of medical ultrasound system. The technique can be established by finding a method to distinguish between bone and bone marrow. Firstly, the A-mode signal intensity was fitted by the form, A=A 0 exp(-αx), where A, A 0, α, and x represent echo intensity, initial value of echo, attenuation factor, and distance, respectively. Then the curve was moved slightly downward or upward by multiplying with the coefficient k (0. 9 ~ 1. 2), and it {{was used as an}} index line to distinguish between bone and bone marrow. To clarify the validity of the proposed technique, we examined bovine bone specimen and a spongy-shaped specimen made by ceramics.
