Gates to {{act quickly}} on the recommendation. “... it is <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> both you and the President can move forward on Master Sergeant Keeble’s case as expeditiously as possible,” Johnson {{said in a letter}} to Gates quoted in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|After {{seven years}} of pain and hard {{struggle}} it was <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch. Unfortunately, this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|E
500|$|The title story, [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set {{in early}} 19th century Gloucestershire and {{concerns}} the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though {{the events of the}} story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, [...] "For a long time it was <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> these three ladies should eventually find a place in...the novel...I decided there was no place for them...I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity...it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel." [...] Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the collection and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations". In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons, Victoria Hoyle writes that [...] "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural {{and in the course of}} things." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t is <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be <b>my</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

[...] During a Republican debate, she took a [...] "hawkish" [...] stance on Iran, saying all options {{should be on the}} table, including the military one. She said that the U.S. military should be [...] "second to none", and promised more representation to defense contractors from Connecticut, including Sikorsky.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the murder, Davis was acting {{governor}} as Governor Pete Wilson was out of the country on a trade visit. [...] Wilson's spokesman stated that the governor did not proactively volunteer rewards but would act only after local law enforcement requested it. On February 8, Wilson rescinded the offer Davis had made, citing the Cosby family's request that no taxpayer money be used as a reward. [...] "The Cosby family has my heartfelt sympathy," [...] Wilson said in a statement. [...] "I also regret that the Cosby family has had to respond to a barrage of media attention with regards to rewards offered by the state and other entities. It is <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> withdrawing this reward brings a close to this issue and takes a burden off the Cosby family." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{position}} of the Socialist Party of New York, as voiced in the present [...] campaign, makes it a plain matter of duty on my part to resign my membership at once. The party is opposed to the conduct of war. I am whole-heartedly supporting {{the cause of the}} Allies against Germany. It was <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the party might not make the war a primary issue here or throughout the nation; in that case I might have honorably retained my membership. But the campaign here is to be waged directly and solely upon the issue of the war. ... The social ideals I have had the privilege of advancing among you are now more precious to me than ever before. But I am positive in my belief that even a partial victory of German militarism would institute militarism and the servile state throughout the world and thus make an end of political democracy and of the great hope he have of industrial democracy in our generation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ibárruri {{offered a}} string of speeches, some of them radio {{broadcasts}} from Madrid: [...] "Danger! To arms!" [...] (July 19), [...] "Our fighters must lack for nothing!" [...] (July 24), [...] "Discipline, composure, vigilance!" [...] (July 29), [...] "Restrain {{the hand of the}} foreign meddlers!" [...] (July 30), [...] "Fascism shall not pass!"

[...] (September 3), [...] "A salute to our militiawomen on the front line" [...] (September 4), [...] "Our battle cry has been heard by the whole world" [...] (September 15). It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied {{to the side of the}} Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, [...] "You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock. And in this fighting some of our finest and bravest comrades have perished."
