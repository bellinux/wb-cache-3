50|$|<b>Material</b> <b>balances</b> are {{a method}} of {{economic}} planning where material supplies are accounted for in natural units (as opposed to using monetary accounting) and used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. <b>Material</b> <b>balancing</b> involves taking {{a survey of the}} available inputs and raw materials in an economy and then using a balance sheet to balance the inputs with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for resource allocation and investment in a national economy.|$|R

With this method, an environmental allocative efficiency measure can be defined analogously to the more commonly used economic allocative efficiency. Nutrient surplus in pig fattening, a typical balance indicator, is used to illustrate the concept in a two input one output case. The <b>materials</b> <b>balance</b> based efficiency analysis is elaborated using data envelopment analysis (DEA).

The estimation of the model involves a composed error term structure that is commonly applied in the literature on stochastic frontier analysis of productive effciency. Moreover, we discuss how OLS, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods can be used to estimate the proposed model. In contrast to previous approaches our model allows to estimate the physical limitations to production possibilities in the presence of statistical noise and depends on substantially weaker data requirements.

40|$|The main {{quantitative}} {{measure of}} nuclear safeguards effec-tiveness is nuclear material accounting (NMA), which con-sists of sequences of measured <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> {{that should be}} close to zero {{if there is no}} loss of special nuclear material such as Pu. NMA is essentially “accounting with measure-ment errors, ” which arise from good, but imperfect, measure-ments. The covariance matrix ΣMB of a sequence of <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> is the key quantity that determines the probability to detect loss. There is a recent push to include process moni-toring (PM) data along with <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> from NMA in new schemes to monitor for material loss. PM data includes near-real-time measurements by the operator to monitor and control process operations. One concern regarding PM data is the need to estimate normal behavior of PM residuals, which requires a training period prior to ongoing testing for mate-rial loss. Assuming that a training period is used for PM data prior to its use in statistical testing for loss, that same training period could also be used for improving the estimate of ΣMB that is used in NMA. We consider updating ΣMB using training data with a Bayesian approach. A simulation study assesses the improvement gained with larger amounts of training data. 1...|$|R
