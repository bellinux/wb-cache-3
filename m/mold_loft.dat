50|$|General Stores and <b>Mold</b> <b>Loft</b> Building-Harriman Yard of the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, {{also known}} as Manhattan Soap Company Warehouse, is a {{historic}} warehouse located at Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1917, and is a three-story, rectangular reinforced concrete building. The warehouse building {{was one of a}} complex of approximately 30 buildings constructed by the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation at Harriman Yard during World War I. In 1925, it was acquired by the Manhattan Soap Company, which was acquired by the Purex Corporation in 1956. It was later used as a manufacturing facility for Dial soap until 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly 18,000 {{boats were}} built under the Cal brand name. There were many {{different}} models - {{the first of}} the ultra-light, production ocean racers, the Cal 40 was inspired by ocean racer George Griffith, of the Los Angeles Yacht Club. Following Griffith's initial design, the Cal 40 was developed by naval architect C. William [...] "Bill" [...] Lapworth. Griffith sought out Jack Jensen to build the first boat, Persephone, but had to guarantee the sale of ten boats, which was quickly accomplished, even before the first boat was out of the <b>mold.</b> <b>Lofting</b> was performed by Willis Boyd. A major undertaking for its time and radically different from other production racing sailboats with its fin keel separated from a spade rudder mounted well aft, the Cal 40 astonished the yachting community by Don Salisbury's Hull #3 [...] "Psyche" [...] winning first overall in the 1965 Transpac with Griffith aboard. The Cal40 continues to rack up an impressive string of ocean racing victories more than four decades after its initial launch, winning major competitions such as the Newport-Bermuda Race as recently as 2008. Among other ocean racing classics, Cal 40s still compete as a class in the Transpac from Los Angeles to Honolulu and in 2005 recorded 14 entries, more than any other production sailboat {{at any time in the}} century-long history of this, America's longest-running ocean yacht race.|$|R
5000|$|After or {{simultaneously}} {{with the creation}} of the drawings, a builder's half model was assembled from which measurements were taken to create molds of the timbers. In a process known as [...] "molding", the dimensions of the framing pieces were chalked onto the floor of a <b>mold</b> <b>loft</b> where a template was formed using strips of light wood. Once the molds were transported to the timber crews, the templates were used to select the part of a tree that closely matched the template. From there the timber was felled and roughed out close to the required dimensions, then numbered for identification and loaded onto a ship for transport. An additional set of more detailed molds was required for each frigate for the construction crews to follow.|$|E
5000|$|With {{only two}} weeks notice, the many {{residents}} of Pine Point, a picturesque knoll located {{along the edge of}} the bay, were forcibly evicted by 28 March 1942. About 42 homes and buildings were removed. At least 12 homes avoided demolition by being rapidly moved elsewhere in Sausalito before the rest were razed and Pine Point was dynamited. Records show that an estimated [...] of earth and rock were excavated from Pine Point, Waldo Point and nearby areas. The resulting fill was spread using heavy equipment across the shoreline and tidal mudflats to create new land on which the various buildings of the shipyard were rapidly constructed. Some of these buildings are still in use today, including as the Industrial Center Building (ICB) at 480 Gate Five Road (originally the Yard Office and <b>Mold</b> <b>Loft</b> Building) and the Schoonmaker Building at 10 Libertyship Way (originally the General Shop).|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, Bristol gained {{national}} attention when the song [...] "Bristol Stomp", by The Dovells hit #2 on the Billboard pop chart. The song remains a local favorite, {{and it is}} often played at ceremonies, parades, and sporting events. The Merchant Shipbuilding site returned to the news in the 1990s when the Bucks County Redevelopment Authority using state and federal funding targeted the area as a priority for urban redevelopment. Given its riverfront location, the old shipbuilding site was ranked highest in priority, and on 20 October 2000 various legislators and officials {{held a press conference}} at the former shipyard heralding the construction of the residential development already under way, known as the Riverfront North Project, and publicizing how derelict portions of the slipways were being removed. The project also established a park with four monuments celebrating the towns past in the redevelopment. Today the preserved elements of the shipyard, and other buildings once important in Bristols past service are enshrined and celebrated in the Bristol Historic District, Bristol Industrial Historic District, and tourism sites celebrating the towns history and rich ethnic diversity. Various annual festivals, in particular keep a multi-ethnic cultural identity alive and well. Historic sites in the town such as the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, Dorrance Mansion, General Stores and <b>Mold</b> <b>Loft</b> Building-Harriman Yard of the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, Grundy Mill Complex, Harriman Historic District, Jefferson Avenue School and Jefferson Land Association Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal is also designated a National Historic Landmark District.|$|E
