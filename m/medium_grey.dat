25|$|From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, {{with a dark}} head, a {{yellowish}} behind, and a white stripe {{running along}} the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along {{the base of the}} bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, {{and the rest of the}} body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing <b>medium</b> <b>grey</b> even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the speculum feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge.

Its head is mostly white with a dark grey or black nape and hood, with a short black beak and dark eyes. The long tail is <b>medium</b> <b>grey</b> with lighter tips. The legs and feet are black.

Juveniles are initially coloured very dark grey all over, gaining adult plumage after a first moult in July or August. The average lifespan of territory-owning grey jays is eight years; the oldest known grey jay banded and recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.|$|E

2500|$|The Rock of Gibraltar is {{interpreted}} by geologists as a klippe of Jurassic dolomitic limestone with series of 'shale' formations underlying {{and in part}} overlaying the limestone.
