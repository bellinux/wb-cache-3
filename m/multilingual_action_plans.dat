40|$|Purpose: An <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> is an {{agreement}} between clinician and patient that the patient will make a spe-cific behavior change. The goals {{of this study are}} to: determine whether it is feasible for patients to make <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in the primary care visit; determine whether patients report carrying out their action plans; and describe the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> patients choose. Methods: Forty-three clinicians in 8 primary care sites were recruited to hold action-plan discus-sions with patients. Research assistants contacted patients by telephone 3 weeks later to assess whether patients had conducted their <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Eighty-three percent of enrolled patients (228) made an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> during a primary care visit. Of the 79 % who recalled making the <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> when interviewed by telephone 3 weeks later, 56 % recalled the details of their <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> and an additional 33 % recalled the general nature of the <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> At least 53 % of patients making an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> reported making a behavior change consistent with that <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: Most patients reported making a behavior change based on an <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> may be a useful strategy to encourage behavior change for patients seen in primary care.

40|$|Objective: <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> is {{regarded}} as an important correlate and predictor of health behaviour, but {{little is known about}} antecedents of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Because personality constructs have been shown to moderate the effect of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> interventions, the present study tested associations of personality dimensions with <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and fruit consumption. Design and setting: Cross-sectional data collected with self-administered questionnaires in a university setting. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 443; mean age = 21. 45 (SD = 2. 96) years, 68. 7 % females) who participated for course credits and completed measures of personality dimensions, <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> intention, and fruit consumption based on validated questionnaires. The first set of analyses focused on antecedents of fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> employing stepwise regression analysis. The second set of analyses focused on intention and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as mediators of the personality-fruit consumption link using structural equation modelling. Results: Higher scores for fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> were found for more conscientiousness and less neurotic individuals. Further, more conscientious individuals consumed more fruits and this relationship was mediated by <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusion: Findings provide support for <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as a mediator in the Conscientiousness-fruit consumption link and suggest that personality influences may need {{to be taken into account}} when developing <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies aimed at increasing fruit consumption...|$|R

Many European {{countries}} have also developed national Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> {{to promote and}} support organic agriculture. As part of the EU funded ORGAP project (“European <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> of Organic Food and Farming - Development of criteria and procedures {{for the evaluation of}} the EU <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for Organic Agriculture”) a toolbox to evaluate and monitor the implementation of national and European <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> has been developed. In order to communicate the results of this project as widely as possible, a practical manual for initiating and evaluating Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> has been produced. This manual has been created to inspire the people, organisations and institutions involved, or with an interest, in the organic food and farming sector to engage in the initiation, review, revision and renewal of regional, national and European Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans.</b> The objectives of the manual are to provide: • a tool for stakeholder involvement in future <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> development and implementation processes at EU, national and regional level • a guide {{to the use of the}} Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> Evaluation Toolbox (ORGAPET) developed through the project The manual summarises the key lessons learnt from more than 10 years experience of development, implementation and evaluation of Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> throughout Europe.

Both habit strength and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> moderated the intention-exercise relationship, with stronger relationship at higher levels of planning or habit strength.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} improve the {{transition}} from an intention {{to a change in}} health behaviour, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> is a frequently used behavioural change method. The quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of instrumentality and specificity is important in terms of supporting a successful change in health behaviour. Until now, little has been known about the predictors of <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> generation and the predictors of high quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and, therefore, the current study investigates these predictors. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted to improve physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption using a web-based computer tailored intervention. During the 8 -week intervention period, participants in the intervention arm (n[*]=[*] 346) were guided (step-by-step) to generate their own <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to improve their health behaviours. Demographic characteristics, social cognitions, and health behaviour were assessed at baseline by means of self-reporting. Whether participants generated <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was tracked by means of server registrations within two modules of the intervention. Results The <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component of the intervention regarding physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption was used by 40. 9 and 20. 7  % of the participants, respectively. We found that participants who were physically active at baseline were less likely to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> concerning physical activity. With regards to generating fruit and vegetable <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> participants with a high risk perception and a strong intention to eat fruit and vegetables on a daily basis made more use of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component for this behaviour. Finally, the large majority of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for physical activity (96. 6  %) and fruit and vegetable consumption (100  %) were instrumental and about half of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be highly specific (PA[*]=[*] 69. 6  %/FV[*]=[*] 59. 7  %). The specificity of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> is associated with having a relationship and low levels of negative outcome expectancies. Conclusion Risk perception and intention are predictors of using the application of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Increasing the motivation to change behaviour should be prioritised in interventions concerning changes in health behaviour before participants are asked to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> This would also make the intervention suitable for unmotivated people. For those participants who already perform the desired health behaviour prior to the intervention, <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> might be less relevant. Nevertheless, using a guided step-by-step approach to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> resulted in highly instrumental and specific <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and might be integrated into other interventions concerning changes in health behaviour.
