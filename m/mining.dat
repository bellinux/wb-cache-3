5|$|In 1976, Congress {{passed the}} <b>Mining</b> in the Parks Act, which closed Death Valley National Monument to {{the filing of}} new <b>mining</b> claims, banned open-pit <b>mining</b> and {{required}} the National Park Service to examine the validity {{of tens of thousands}} of pre-1976 <b>mining</b> claims. <b>Mining</b> was allowed to resume on a limited basis in 1980 with stricter environmental standards.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves <b>mining</b> followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface <b>mining</b> involve open pit <b>mining</b> and strip <b>mining.</b> These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground <b>mining</b> of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the <b>mining</b> of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private <b>mining</b> company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi <b>mining</b> company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E

5|$|Coal <b>mining</b> {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the <b>mining</b> was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter <b>mining</b> was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground <b>mining</b> in the watershed stopped. Strip <b>mining</b> was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all <b>mining</b> stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test <b>mining</b> techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When <b>mining</b> ultimately begins, each <b>mining</b> operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single <b>mining</b> operation, nodule <b>mining</b> might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} <b>mining.</b> Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold <b>mining</b> {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer <b>mining</b> have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver <b>mining.</b>|$|E
