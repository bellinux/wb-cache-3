5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student pilot certificate, since they require a <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of 16, or a pilot certificate that requires a <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no record-keeping body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the age of}} twenty-three, male commoners became eligible for conscription into the armed forces (zhengzu 正卒) for one year of training and one year of service; the year of service could be served {{until the age of}} fifty-six. Conscripts were trained, and would serve in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or naval marine. The year of service could take the form of soldiering at frontier garrisons protecting the borders against nomadic enemies, serving as guards in the courts of kings or as guards under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. By 155 BC, the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> for conscription was lowered to twenty. During Emperor Zhao of Han's (r. 87–74 BC) reign, the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> was raised to twenty-three, but after his reign it was once again reduced to twenty.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.|$|E

They support a non-age-based alternative to every age-based law, and believe that the rights of all people to freedom and self-determination outweigh the cost of implementing non-age-based laws.|$|R

Businesses may issue free or complimentary drink coupons (up to one per day per patron). Hotel and motel licensees may also give guests complimentary bottles of wine on special occasions.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy.

40|$|Over the years, the <b>minimum</b> dropout <b>age</b> {{has been}} raised to 18 in 21 states. Although these policy changes are {{promoted}} for their educational benefits, they {{have been shown to}} reduce crimes committed by youths in the affected age groups. However, an unintended consequence of increasing the <b>minimum</b> dropout <b>age</b> could be the displacement of crime from the streets to schools. We use data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys to estimate the relationship between <b>minimum</b> dropout <b>age</b> laws and student victimization. Our results suggest that higher <b>minimum</b> dropout <b>ages</b> increase the likelihood that females and younger students report missing school for fear of their safety and younger {{students are more likely to}} report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. Our results also yield some evidence that students are more likely to report being victims of in-school theft when the <b>minimum</b> dropout <b>age</b> is higher...|$|R
50|$|Members of the U.S. Congress tend to {{be older}} than parliamentarians {{elsewhere}} in the English-speaking world, a main factor being that the <b>minimum</b> <b>ages</b> for members of Congress is written into Article One of the United States Constitution, which forbids persons {{under the age of}} 25 from serving in the House and persons under the age of 30 from serving in the Senate. Moreover, election to the federal Congress is expensive and requires extensive contacts and recognition across a very wide area. Individuals aiming to serve in the federal legislature generally seek election to the state legislature (which generally have lower <b>minimum</b> <b>ages</b> for entry) or other state office before seeking to serve in Washington.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride and shoot. Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State {{on its way to the}} relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown.|$|E
