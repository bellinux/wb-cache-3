In Wild Boys of the Road (1933), the young man played by Frankie Darrow leads a group of dispossessed juvenile drifters who frequently brawl with the police. Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler heading up the march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his <b>morphine</b> <b>addiction,</b> which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} poses serious social, medical, {{and economic}} problems, but effective treatments for drug addiction are still limited. Cocaine and morphine elevate dopamine {{levels in the}} nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the overwhelming actions of dopamine are implicated in reinforcement and addiction of abusive drugs. In our previous studies, we reported the regulatory role of acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAc function by selectively ablating the NAc cholinergic neurons with use of immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting. These studies indicated that ACh and dopamine acted convergently but oppositely on the NAc circuit and that cholinergic cell ablation enhanced long-lasting behavioral changes of cocaine addiction. In this investigation, we showed that immunotoxin-mediated ablation of the NAc cholinergic neurons enhanced not only the sensitivity to morphine in conditioned place preference but also negative reinforcement of morphine withdrawal in conditioned place aversion. Remarkably, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that act on the brain AChE suppressed both cocaine- and morphine-induced conditioned place preference and blocked the induction and persistence of cocaine-evoked hyperlocomotion. Importantly, this inhibition was abolished by ablation of the NAc cholinergic neurons. These results demonstrate that centrally active AChE inhibitors prevent long-lasting behavioral abnormalities associated with cocaine and <b>morphine</b> <b>addictions</b> by potentiating the actions of ACh released from the NAc cholinergic neurons. Centrally active AChE inhibitors could thus be approached as novel and potential therapeutic agents for drug addiction...|$|R

25|$|During his {{recovery}} {{at the hospital}} from his wounds suffered in that battle, Ross developed a habit for the morphine administered for pain.

25|$|Cody, {{together}} with his wife, toured England with a shooting act. Maud used the stage name Lillian Cody, which she kept {{for the rest of}} her performing career. In London, they met Mrs Elizabeth Mary King (née Davis), wife of Edward John 'Ted' King, a licensed victualler, and mother of four children, Edward, Leon, Vivian and Liese. Mrs King had stage ambitions for her sons. In 1891, Maud taught the boys how to shoot, but then later returned to the USA alone.

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with <b>morphine</b> <b>addiction</b> are usually experienced {{shortly before the}} time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6h to 12h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, yawning, dysphoria, sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases, which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.|$|E

25|$|Berthold {{had often}} flown a Pfalz D.III in {{preference}} to the Albatros D.V. In May 1918, the new Fokker D.VII entered service. Berthold borrowed {{one of the}} new machines from Jagdgeschwader 1 for a surrepitious test flight. He liked its lightness on the controls, remarking hopefully that he could even fly it with his damaged right arm. On the morning of 28 May, he mounted a brand-new Fokker D.VII and for the first time, led his air wing into combat. Although it was a ground support mission, he took the opportunity to score his 29th victory. The following day, he downed two more enemy aircraft, despite a malfunctioning gun synchronizer that nearly shot away his own propeller and caused a crash-landing. Berthold's drug addiction did not handicap him in the air. Georg von Hantelmann, one of his pilots, noted that despite his undiminished martial skills, his <b>morphine</b> <b>addiction</b> made him temperamentally erratic. Nevertheless, his subordinates remained loyal to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychological}} dependence associated with <b>morphine</b> <b>addiction</b> {{is complex and}} protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think {{and talk about the}} use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process. Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including {{psychological dependence}}. A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.|$|E

40|$|Regulators of G protein {{signaling}} (RGS) are {{a family}} of proteins known to accelerate termination of effector stimulation after G protein receptor activation. RGS 9 - 2, a brain-specific splice variant of the RGS 9 gene, is highly enriched in striatum and also expressed at much lower levels in periaqueductal gray and spinal cord, structures known to mediate various actions of morphine and other opiates. Morphine exerts its acute rewarding and analgesic effects by activation of inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled opioid receptors, whereas chronic <b>morphine</b> causes <b>addiction,</b> tolerance to its acute analgesic effects, and profound physical dependence by sustained activation of these receptors. We show here that acute morphine administration increases expression of RGS 9 - 2 in NAc and the other CNS regions, whereas chronic exposure decreases RGS 9 - 2 levels. Mice lacking RGS 9 show enhanced behavioral responses to acute and chronic morphine, including {{a dramatic increase in}} morphine reward, increased morphine analgesia with delayed tolerance, and exacerbated morphine physical dependence and withdrawal. These findings establish RGS 9 as a potent negative modulator of opiate action in vivo, and suggest that opiate-induced changes in RGS 9 levels contribute to the behavioral and neural plasticity associated with chronic opiate administration...|$|R
