40|$|An {{integrated}} {{mode filter}} {{in the form}} of a shallow surface relief was used to reduce the spectral width of a high-speed 850 nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). The mode filter reduced the RMS spectral width from 0. 9 to 0. 3 nm for a VCSEL with an oxide aperture as large as 5 mu m. Because of reduced effects of chromatic and <b>modal</b> <b>fibre</b> dispersion, the mode filter significantly increases the maximum error-free (bit error rate < 10 (- 12)) transmission distance, enabling transmission at 25 Gbit/s over 500 m of multimode OM 3 + fibre...|$|E
40|$|Regenerated {{cellulose}} fibres {{have had}} {{an important role to}} play in the man-made fibre field. The very special characteristics of different types of regenerated cellulose fibres, e. g. mechanical properties, sorption characteristics, and aesthetics were conditioned by the differences in their fine structure due to fibre formation processes. Additionally, the finishing processes could influence the fibre structure. A study was done of the crystalline structures of a solvent-spun cellulose fibre type (Lenzing Lyocell), made according to the NMMO process, and two conventional cellulosic fibre types, made by the viscose process (Lenzing Viscose and Lenzing <b>Modal).</b> The <b>fibres</b> were pre-treated (bleached and slack mercerised) and structural changes were followed by wide angle and small angle x-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS), respectively. The periodical structure, determined by long spacing, was nearly the same in all the different types of fibres. A slight increase was observed after the treatment of viscose and <b>modal</b> <b>fibres,</b> but an unpronounced fall of a long period accompanied the pre-treatment of lyocell fibres. Some changes in crystallinity and crystalline orientation occurred due to the treatment conditions. The structural changes were correlated to the iodinesorption and mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Wettability and sorptivity {{improvements}} {{for different}} textile materials {{are the major}} tasks during textile finishing. In order to improve the sorption characteristics of a cellulose fabric, different pre-treatment processes are applied, usually washing, bleaching and mercerisation. Differences in the sorption properties of un-treated and pre-treated (washed and bleached) regenerated cellulose fibres were obtained using tensiometry and compared with the classical method for determining moisture adsorption. Results show that compared to raw fibres, viscose fibres have the highest moisture and the smallest contact angle whilst <b>modal</b> <b>fibres</b> have the biggest contact angle. Pre-treatment increases the sorption abilities and makes the material more accessible to Chemicals used in the finishing processes. Using the conventional method, it can be confirmed that fibres with the highest moisture have the smallest contact angle (tensiometry) ...|$|R
40|$|Regenerated {{cellulosic}} fibres {{undergo a}} process described as scission-reordering during hydrolysis in solutions of mineral acid. This occurs within disordered polymer regions at lateral crystal interfaces, which are accessible to aqueous agents through the pore spaces and polymer free volume. This process {{is distinct from}} that of oligomer-solubilsation, which occurs within disordered polymer regions in series between crystal domains, where no effective template exists for recrystallisation. The degradation of series disorder will have the greatest influence on fibre tensile properties, which fall dramatically even at low levels of hydrolysis. The mechanics of fibrillation are most sensitive to the degradation of lateral disorder, which occurs {{at a higher rate}} constant. Soft-touch fabric processing may therefore be possible under conditions where there is a reduced influence on tensile performance. A kinetic model has been proposed to describe the hydrolysis and recrystallisation pathways, which shows that lyocell has longer but thinner crystal domains than viscose or <b>modal</b> <b>fibres,</b> and also a tighter distribution of lateral crystal sizes. Lyocell also has a lower proportion of series disorder and also thinner regions of lateral disorder. This is consistent with the overall greater crystallinity of the original lyocell fibre and the also of the final microscrystalline product...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>modal</b> noise {{occurs in}} high {{spectral}} resolution, high signal-to-noise applications. It imposes fundamental {{limits on the}} photometric accuracy of state-of-the-art fibre-spectrograph systems. In order to maximize the performance of current and future instruments it is therefore essential to predict <b>fibre</b> <b>modal</b> noise. To attain a predictive model we are using a dual approach, bringing theoretical assumptions {{in line with the}} experimental data obtained using a test-bench spectrograph. We show that the task of noise prediction can be reduced to determining the visibility of the modal pattern which can be measured at the detector plane. Subsequently, the visibility-dependence of essential parameters is presented. This work will soon provide a basis for prediction of modal noise limitations in fibre-coupled spectrograph designs.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} {{comparative study of}} the colour, abrasion and colour fastness properties of plain knitted fabrics made from 100 % <b>modal</b> viscose <b>fibres</b> in different fibre finenesses such as microfibre and conventional fibre, their 50 / 50 blends with cotton fibre and 100 % cotton fibre. Abrasion behaviours of the fabrics were assessed by measuring the weight loss and colour values after four different abrasion cycles. All the results were compared with respect to both the fibre fineness and blend proportion of cotton fibre in the fabrics. The L * and K/S values of the fabrics after abrasion reveal a similar tendency {{to that of the}} fabrics before abrasion. Before and after abrasion cycles, the fabrics with microfibre revealed lower K/S and C * values and higher L * values than those with conventional fibre. With an increase in the cotton amount, the K/S values of the fabrics decrease and the L* values of the fabrics increase. Key words: microfibre, modal, viscose, cotton, plain knitted fabric, colour properties. loss difference before and after a certain number of abrasion cycles or the numbe...|$|R
40|$|The Lewis-acid {{catalytic}} {{reactions of}} magnesium chloride with regenerated cellulosic fibres under baking conditions {{can be interpreted}} using existing semi-crystalline morphological models. Reaction at 180 °C is associated with chain scission, which takes place randomly within the accessible regions of the fibre structure. This causes a rapid reduction in the cellulose degree of polymerization, which stabilizes at a limiting value, analogous to that observed with wet-state mineral acid catalysed hydrolysis. A slower scission-reaction is also observed, believed {{to be due to}} the liberation of single glucan units from crystallite ends, again analogous to wet-state mineral acid hydrolysis. Dry-state catalysis is promoted by thermal molecular motion, allowing migration of catalyst ions and also conformational flexing of the cellulose polymer, which also induces a small amount of recrystallisation at crystallite lateral surfaces. Differences in the dry-state reaction have been observed for lyocell, viscose and <b>modal</b> regenerated <b>fibres,</b> which can be related to differences in crystallinity and resulting accessibility of the magnesium chloride catalyst. For lyocell the accessibility towards magnesium chloride is lower than found with mineral acids, which may be significant in the development of treatments to promote mechanical fibrillation, without sacrificing fibre tensile properties...|$|R

We present an original design of a multicore fibre (MCF) terminated with multimode photonic lantern ports. It is designed {{to act as a}} relay fibre with the coupling effciency of a multimode <b>fibre,</b> <b>modal</b> stability similar to a single-mode fibre and low loss {{in a wide range of}} wavelengths (380 nm to 860 nm). It provides phase and amplitude scrambling to achieve a stable near field and far field output illumination pattern despite input coupling variations, and low modal noise for increased photometric stability for high signal-to-noise applications such as precision radial velocity (PRV) science. Preliminary results are presented for a 511 -core MCF and compared with current state of the art octagonal fibre. Comment: 11 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A Radio-over-Fibre {{system to}} {{distribute}} wireless LAN signals over multimode fibre {{has been designed}} and analysed. The system employs a novel frequency multiplication technique, to surmount modal-dispersion-induced bandwidth limitation in multimode fibre in general and in Graded Index Polymer Optical Fibre (GIPOF) in particular. This is achieved by frequency modulating the optical signal at the source, and then periodically filtering the received signal at the remote station prior to direct detection by the photodiode. Data modulation is added by intensity modulating the frequency modulated optical signal. While {{the frequency of the}} modulating signal at the source is limited by the <b>fibre’s</b> <b>modal</b> bandwidth, the frequency of the generated electrical microwave signal is not. The frequency of the generated electrical signal is determined by optical parameters such as the optical frequency deviation impressed at the source, and the free spectral range of the periodic filter at the remote station. Simulation results show that the system is capable of generating high purity electrical carriers at 5. 4 GHz, and higher microwave and millimetre wave frequencies, which are several orders of magnitude beyond the bandwidth of multimode fibre for link lengths of up to 500 m. In addition, the system can handle both linear and constant envelop modulated data such as ASK, PSK and QAM at capacities beyond 56 Mbps per carrier. The use of multimode fibre and especially GIPOF in the wireless LAN feeder network instead of standard single-mode fibre greatly reduces installation and maintenance costs while offering more capacity than the present copper-based infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to make high-density broadband wireless LANs of the future, economically and technically feasible...|$|R
40|$|Global {{production}} and consumption of textiles is increasing {{and as a result}} putting pressure on the environment. In the EU- 25 countries for example, 2 - 10 % of environmental impacts are associated with clothing consumption, with washing during the use phase {{as one of the most}} significant contributors. Antibacterial textiles, which prevent undesirable odours, may reduce the number of washing cycles, thus offering an opportunity to reduce environmental impacts. This article assess to what extent different antibacterial T-shirts offer opportunities. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assist the producer in making business decisions to create value during product development process. To this end, we conducted an LCA for an antibacterial T-shirt made in Europe from bio-based man-made cellulose <b>fibres</b> (<b>modal).</b> The antibacterial property is obtained by silver nanoparticles that are produced with colloidal techniques such as the sol gel process and in-situ formation. It was found that the T-shirt made of 50 % antibacterial fibres with the in-situ process (50 AB in-situ) caused 15 - 20 % lower cradle-to-gate CO 2 emissions than commercial antibacterial T-shirts. The cradle-to-grave comparison with non-antibacterial modal T-shirts showed that the 50 AB in-situ T-shirt exhibited better environmental performance, resulting in 20 - 30 % lower impacts in key categories such as climate change, freshwater toxicity and eutrophication. LCA demonstrated value creation opportunities such as lower environmental impacts, lower costs and risks. Moreover, the product's environmental performance can be transparently communicated to customers, which helps differentiating with competing products in the market, thus offering the producer a competitive advantage.

40|$|Photonic crystal fibres (PCF) {{are a new}} {{generation}} of optical fibre that guide light via a periodic air-silica, photonic crystal structure instead of the more traditional step change in refractive index associated with traditional fibre. Careful design of the photonic structure causes the fibres to behave in interesting new ways and one of main aims of this thesis is to begin the investigation of the uses of PCF's in astronomy. Step index and large mode area (LMA) PCF's are introduced in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Chapter 4 then deals with the instrumental simplifications {{associated with the use of}} LMA PCF'ร in fibre stellar interferometry showing that up to four step index fibres and associated optics can be replaced with a single LMA fibre. One of the key features of LMA fibres, for astronomy, is that, unlike the step index fibre, the mode field size is independent of wavelength and the fibre can therefore be fed with a pupil image via a field lens. Chapter 5 investigates this important new parameter space showing that contiguous sampling using single mode fibres is now possible for the first time. Further, unlike the direct feed to the LMA fibre, maximised coupling over very large wavebands is now possible using just a single fibre. Chapter 6 deals with another new fibre technology in astronomy: Multi-mode fibre (MMF) to single-mode array (SMA) transitions. These fibre systems break out the modes of the multi-mode fibre into an array of single-mode fibres upon which Bragg gratings can be etched. The SMA is then refused into an output MMF resulting in a multimode device but with single-mode line suppression. The number of modes transmitted is numerically equal to the number of fibres in the SMA and the performance of these devices is investigated on a model telescope showing that only a few tens of modes is required to efficiently transmit either the J or н bands. Finally, Chapter 7 details the experimental investigation of <b>fibre</b> <b>modal</b> noise in high dispersion spectroscopy. This is a photometric error on a resolution element due to fibre modes interfering with each other at very high spectral dispersion. Worryingly, the results show that no current theory exists that can predict the performance of a fibre based high R spectrometer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
