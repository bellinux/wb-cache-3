To assess whether the modern {{distribution of the}} genus {{can be explained by}} the tropical conservatism hypothesis, we tested three predictions: (1) species from all Nothofagus subgenera coexisted under <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climates</b> during the early Eocene; (2) tolerance to microthermal climates evolved during the Eocene-Oligocene cooling from an ancestor that grew under mesothermal conditions; and (3) the climatic niche in Nothofagus is phylogenetically conserved. LocationAustralia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea and South America. MethodsWe estimated the palaeoclimate of the Early Eocene, fossil-bearing Ligorio Marquez Formation (LMF, Chile), using coexistence and leaf physiognomic analysis. We reconstructed ancestral climatic niches of Nothofagus using extant species distributions and a time-calibrated phylogeny. Finally, we used the morphological disparity index and phylogenetic generalized least squares to assess whether climatic variables follow a Brownian motion (BM) or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of evolution. ResultsOur palaeoclimatic estimates suggest mesothermal conditions for the LMF, where macrofossils associated with subgenera Lophozonia and possibly Fuscospora, and fossil pollen of Brassospora and Fuscospora/Nothofagus were recorded. These results are not supported by our phylogenetic analysis, which instead suggests that the ancestor of Nothofagus lived under microthermal to marginally mesothermal conditions, with tolerance to mesothermal conditions evolving only in the subgenus Brassospora. Precipitation and temperature dimensions of the realized climatic niche fit with a gradual BM or constrained OU model of evolution. Main ConclusionsOur results suggest that the use of phylogenetic reconstruction methods based only on present distributions of extant taxa to infer ancestral climatic niches is likely to lead to erroneous results when climatic requirements of ancestors differ from their extant descendants, or when much extinction has occurred.

Additionally, we compared the site index of western redcedar to that of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.). We sampled 105 plots from stands having western redcedar as the major tree species. The plots were distributed within each of two climates, a drier and a wetter cool <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> in south coastal British Columbia. Sixty-three plots had both western redcedar and western hemlock available for comparisons. Heights and ages were measured on five dominant trees on a 0. 04 ha plot, and the height at a base age of 50 years was calculated to give site index. The highest western redcedar site index occurred on sites identified as having no moisture deficit or excess and high nitrogen availability. Site index decreased on sites identified by field procedures as being outside this optimum moisture and nutrient condition. The mean site index was significantly greater in the drier cool <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> than the wetter cool <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> on sites identified as having similar soil moisture and nutrient conditions.

If this trait filtering by climate indeed occurs, it should have effects on the composition, dynamics, taxonomic relatedness and co-occurrence patterns of local assemblages, regardless of the taxonomic group considered. This preliminary study aimed to assess the extent to which environmental variables might determine these patterns in local communities and to evaluate whether the ultimate cross-taxon congruence relationships are consistent across, or dependent on, the selected region. To this end, we studied the bryophyte, macrophyte, macroinvertebrate, and amphibian communities in two clusters of temporary wetlands on the NE Iberian Peninsula under mesothermal and semiarid climates. We observed effects of environmental filtering, with the communities differing between the climatic regions not only in their compositions but also in their dynamics and taxonomic relatedness patterns. Although the cross-taxon congruence in terms of species richness was high in the <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate,</b> most of the congruent relationships were disrupted in the semiarid environment.

Abundant fossil conifer wood, much of it with Teredolites borings, is present in outcrop referred to the upper part of the Birdrong Sandstone. Scattered ichthyosauran bones, probable plesiosauran remains, and rare ammonites also are present at this level.

Whereas the average temperature in spring can reach up to 15. 4 °C (Manisa), the averagetemperature in autumn reaches up to 17. 7 °C (Manisa). According to the numeric values, it is demonstrated that there is a difference of 18. 7 °C between summer and winter, a difference of 2. 3 °C between autumn and spring, the summer season is muchhotter than the winter season, and the high temperatures in summer have a slight effect in autumn season. The number of the frosty days in the meteorological stations of the research field does not reach a large total. The annualtotal of the frosty days are 49. 9 in Akhisar, 33. 8 in Soma, 30. 7 in Kınık, 28. 3 in Manisa, 11. 9 in Menemen, and 11. 4 in Aliağa. These values reveal that the number of the frosty days is increasing from shore to inland according to the increase of theterrestrial degree. The average pressure in the research field is 1000. 1 mb in Akhisar, and 1007. 2 mb in Manisa. The difference between extrememonths is 8. 6 mb in Akhisar, and 8. 3 mb in Manisa. the lowest monthly average pressure in the year is seen in July (Akhisar 999. 1 mb, Manisa 1002. 4 mb). Generally east-west and northeast-southwest sectored winds are blowing effectively in the year inthe Yunt Mountain and around. It is possible to see that in the annual wind frequency roses of the meteorological stations. InSoma 22. 9 % NW, in Kınık 36. 8 % NE, in Aliağa 31. 4 % NE, in Akhisar 37 % N, in Menemen 40 % E, in Manisa 23. 1 % E directedwinds blow more than the winds that blow from other directions. Annual wind frequencies and directions identified in theobservation stations present an appropriate situation for the orographic conditions of the site. When the fastest wind directionsand speeds are taken into account, it is determined that the winds are blowing more quickly in Menemen, Akhisar, and Manisa. The wind that has the highest speed in Soma with 8 m/sec. is blowing from NW, in Kınık with 7 m/sec. is blowing from SW, inAkhisar with 32. 2 m/sec. is blowing from WSW, in Aliağa 9 m/sec. is blowing from NE, in Menemen with 22, 5 m/sec. isblowing from S, in Manisa with 36. 2 m/sec. is blowing from SW. The arrival directions of the fastest winds are different. Thefastest winds are blowing in Soma from SW, S, and NW, in Kınık from SW, in Akhisar from WSW and SSE, in Aliağa from NEand SW, in Menemen from S and SE, in Manisa in SW and S. The amount of the relative humidity in the research field is changing between 43 % and 52 % in June and July in which thetemperature increases and the cloud cover rate decreases, whereas it is changing between 66 % and 75 % in December and Januaryin which the temperature decreases and the atmospheric activity increases. The annual average relative humidity rate is 55 % inSoma, 58 % in Menemen, 59 % in Aliağa, 60 % in Kınık and Manisa, and 63 % in Akhisar. The annual average cloudiness rates inthe field are generally low. The annual average cloudiness is 3. 4 in Akhisar, 3. 5 in Menemen, 3. 6 in Manisa, 3. 9 in Aliağa andSoma, and 4. 3 in Kınık. The average monthly rate of cloudiness varies depending on the effect of air masses during the year. Theaverage cloudiness is increased to 5 – 6 especially in winter months in which the atmospheric activity is increased. The annual sum of foggy days in the research field is 17. 7 days in Soma, 14. 7 days in Manisa, 5. 1 days in Akhisar, 3. 5 days inKınık, 1. 4 days in Aliağa, and 0. 5 day in Menemen. When the distribution of foggy days during the year is examined, foggy daysare encountered in all months except July and August. However, high values are seen in the number of the average foggy days inNovember, December and January. The Yunt Mountain and surrounding receives abundant rainfall during the winter months in which the transition frequency offrontal depressions is maximum. While entering the summer season more dry and stable air masses occupies the area and duringsummer season drought prevails. When the annual precipitation rates of the meteorological stations are examined, the rainfall inManisa is 704. 6 mm, in Soma is 652. 4 mm, in Akhisar is 563. 3 mm, in Menemen is 555. 8 mm, in Kınık is 488. 4 mm and in Aliağa is 484 mm. Depending on these rates, the annual average rainfall in the research field is ranging between 704. 6 mm and 484 mm. According to the monthly average rainfall the most rainfalls are seen in December in all observation stations except in Soma. Thelowest values of the average rainfall belong to the months July and August. In the field, close to half of the portion ofprecipitation falling during the year or more than the half is seen in Winter (December, January, February). In Summer (June, July,August), the amount of the rainfall is extremely fall. Spring is more rainy than the Autumn. The annual number of rainy days ismaximum in Manisa with 107. 8 days and minimum in Aliağa with 63. 5 days. The number of rainy days at other observationsstations is 98. 9 days in Akhisar, 97. 1 days in Soma, 87. 8 days in Menemen, and 83 days in Kınık. The number of snowy days atYunt Mountain and around is less. According to the average annual number of snowy days, it is determined that the number ofsnowy days in Soma is 5. 1 days, in Manisa is 3. 2 days, in Kınık is 3. 1 days, in Akhisar is 2. 9 days, in Aliağa is 1. 4 days, in Menemenis 0. 2 day. According to the distribution of snowy days to the months, it is observed that the snowfall occurs in Soma, Kınık, andManisa in 5 -month period between November and March, in Akhisar and Aliağa in 4 -month period between December andMarch, in Menemen in January and February. In order to determine the climate classification of Yunt Mountain and its surrounding area, the formulas of E. de Martonne(1923), Erinç (1965), Thornthwaite (1948) and Köppen (1928) were used. According to the formulas of E. de Martonne andErinç, Soma, Akhisar, Menemen and Manisa are in the semi-humid climate region, Kınık and Aliağa are in the semi-arid climateregion. According to Thornthwaite climate classification, Aliağa, Menemen, and Akhisar take place in the dry and less humid thirdorder <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> type that is having very strong excess of water in winter and close to the marine conditions which isdenoted by C 1 B' 3 s 2 b' 3. Kınık takes place in the dry and less humid third order <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> type that is having moderateexcess of water in winter and close to the marine conditions which is denoted by C 1 B' 3 s b' 3. Soma takes place in the semi-wetsecond order <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> type that is having very strong water shortage in summer and close to the marine conditionswhich is denoted by B' 2 s 2 b' 3. Soma takes place in the semi-humid third order <b>mesothermal</b> <b>climate</b> type that is having very strongwater shortage in summer and close to the marine conditions which is denoted by C 2 B' 3 s 2 b' 3. According to Köppen’s climate classification, Soma, Kınık, Akhisar, Aliağa, and Menemen take place in the warm winter, hotsummer, and arid climate (Mediterranean climate) which is denoted by Csap and Manisa Csap’. As a result, the climate of the Yunt Mountain and {{the surrounding}} area is warm and rainy in winters, hot and dry in summers,moderately wet and close to the effect of the ocean...|$|E
