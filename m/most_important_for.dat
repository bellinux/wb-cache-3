The highest traffic count is at I-80 near Austintown, where 38,360 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is near US 6, where 5,550 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the road}} is located in {{northern}} Bolivar County. In 2012, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 750 vehicles traveling west of US 61/US 278, and as few as 330 vehicles traveling east of MS 1. MS 444 is not included {{as a part of}} the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.

5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|MS 350 {{is located}} in northeastern Alcorn and {{northern}} Tishomingo counties. In 2012, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 2,900 vehicles traveling east of County Road 159 (CR 159), and as few as 1,500 vehicles traveling east of CR 363. All of the road is maintained by MDOT. MS 350 is not included {{as a part of}} the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.

5|$|SR703 {{travels through}} eastern Mercer County and the westernmost portion of Auglaize County. No {{portion of this}} highway is {{included}} within the National Highway System (NHS), a network of routes deemed to be <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The busiest point in the route according to 2016 data was east of Lake Shore Drive in Celina, where the annual average daily traffic (AADT) was 16,775 vehicles. The least busy point was southeast of It's It Road, where the AADT was 1,826 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|All of SR 607 {{is located}} in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the {{intersection}} of SR60 near McConnelsville. SR607 travels north {{for the majority of the}} length. SR 607 passes near an Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR78 at another T-intersection. The route goes through mostly forests and small hills. In 2012, ODOT calculated 1,975 vehicles traveling south of McGovern Lane. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the economy, defense and mobility of the country.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E
5|$|What is <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> us, {{out of the}} heathen fancy of a {{kidnapping}} man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E
