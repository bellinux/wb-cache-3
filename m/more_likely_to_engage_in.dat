(In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> unsafe sex.

40|$|In highly {{structured}} organisational fields individual efforts to deal rationally with uncertainty and constraints tend to lead, in the aggregate, to greater homogeneity in structure, culture and output. Drawing on institutional theory, this paper develops research propositions regarding {{the nature and}} scope of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement at trade/industry association level. The cases {{of the water and}} sewerage and film industries are used in order to test these propositions. The findings suggest that (a) trade associations in more homogeneous industries are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with CSR-related issues; (b) trade associations in industries that face greater external scrutiny and threats <b>to</b> legitimacy are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with CSR-related issues; and (c) trade associations are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with those substantive CSR issues that are of greater concern to the industry's most salient stakeholders. The findings also suggest that trade associations may have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in symbolic legitimation efforts through CSR if faced with the task of repairing industry legitimacy...|$|R

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it {{plays an important role in}} word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study that set out to {{understand}} the backgrounds of apprentices studying Engineering pathways at one FE College in the UK where an integrated programme of qualifications from level 2 to level 7 exists. The research presented here follows on from a previous study that suggested diversity was very low across the programme and that progression opportunities to level 4 and above, that is, Higher Education are not evenly distributed across the socio-economic groupings. The findings are presented {{in the light of}} relevant literature indicating concerns nationally and across sectors about Apprenticeship opportunities not being fairly distributed across socio-economic groupings. The report concludes that there is a relationship between those from lower socio-economic groups being <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with craft type qualifications which do not offer progression possibilities to Higher Education than those from higher socio-economic groups who are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with technical qualifications.

25|$|Social {{psychological}} {{literature has}} found that the level of motivation one has to engage in an activity influences one’s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> social facilitation (that is, to increase one’s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual’s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual’s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or {{other people in the}} workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E

We examine whether firms locate their R&D labs near universities, and whether {{those that do}} are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> co-operate with, or source knowledge from universities. We find that pharmaceutical firms locate R&D near to frontier chemistry research departments, consistent with accessing localised knowledge spillovers, but also linked {{to the presence of}} science parks. In industries such as chemicals and vehicles there is less evidence of immediate co-location, but those innovative firms that do locate near to relevant research departments are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with universities...|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that men are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction {{may be more important}} to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that {{men and women who are}} involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{research}} analyses {{the institutional}} and organisational determinants of shareholder engagement on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues in Brazil and South Africa. Using an institutional framework, this study investigates the institutional incentives and barriers faced by domestic investors when engaging with companies on ESG issues. It also identifies which types of investors are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> The key research question of this PhD study was investigated {{using a combination}} of qualitative and quantitative methods. Statistical analysis was used to identify which types of investors are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage,</b> and the results were explored in semi-structured interviews. The institutional influences on shareholder engagement in these countries were also explored through semi-structured interviews. The research findings demonstrate that the engagement strategies most commonly employed by South African investors are individual meetings with companies to address ESG issues, while Brazilian investors mainly use collaborative engagement and appointment of investor representatives onto Boards of Directors of investee companies. As for the determinants of engagement in these countries, legislation and the influence of investor associations are driving local investors <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with companies both directly and indirectly. Moreover, the influence of the legal and self-regulatory guidelines is encouraging pension funds to question asset managers about their RI practices and, to a lesser extent, to outsource engagement activities. This is because, since most pension funds in Brazil and South Africa are small and lack financial resources, staff and investment knowledge, they are shifting the RI responsibilities imposed on them by mandatory and voluntary regulations to service providers. In terms of investor characteristics, the statistical data and the interviews show that larger investors and asset managers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with investee companies than smaller investors and pension funds. This is largely because smaller investors and pension funds have insufficient resources available to them, pension fund trustees lack investment understanding, and the potential for smaller investors to influence companies is limited. In addition, active investors are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> than passive investors as they are motivated by their goal to outperform the market as well as the remuneration incentives available to active managers. Furthermore, passive investors are unable to divest from companies. By studying the determinants of shareholder engagement in the emerging markets, this study offers academic and practical contributions. Academically, the study contributes to the literature on shareholder engagement, and particularly on emerging markets where the level of RI and engagement activities is increasing, but on which limited literature is available. Furthermore, the research shows that the institutional frameworks in place in Brazil and South Africa are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> bring further growth for the practice of RI and shareholder engagement. As practical contributions, the identification of the most common engagement strategies employed and of the determinants of engagement will help investors to develop more effective engagement strategies and will help public and non-governmental organisations develop policies to foster engagement...|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} the glenoid track is again {{relevant}} when considering Hill Sachs lesions and joint stability [22, 23], as was mentioned earlier. Hill Sachs lesions {{must be considered in}} the context of anterior glenoid bone loss, as probability for recurrent instability increases with larger bony defects {{on either side of the}} joint. In addition, as was discussed by Giacomo et al. [23], location of the lesion plays a large role in determining stability. Medially based lesions are anatomically closer to the anterior glenoid rim, and are therefore <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> during range of motion, thereby causing symptoms of recurrent instability.|$|R

25|$|In humans, {{there is}} a {{seasonal}} variation in aggression associated with changes in testosterone. For example, in some primate species, such as rhesus monkeys and baboons, females are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> fights {{around the time of}} ovulation as well as right before menstruation. If the results were the same in humans as they are in rhesus monkeys and baboons, then the increase in aggressive behaviors during ovulation is explained by the decline in estrogen levels. This makes normal testosterone levels more effective. Castrated mice and rats exhibit lower levels of aggression. Males castrated as neonates exhibit low levels of aggression even when given testosterone throughout their development.|$|E

However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever they want. The larger, older males with thick horns have the best chance of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power. Neck strength is important in an actual fight and the male that cannot keep up yields. Gazelles of nearly equal neck strength are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> actual combat. Fighting occurs in young bucks more often than older ones.

25|$|Across the world, it {{is common}} for people to sleep in the same bed as one another after copulation. Humans are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> sexual {{activity}} at night, so therefore night-time brings the highest danger of infidelity. Due to females investing more in the relationship (Parental investment), women therefore receive more benefits from sleeping with their mate during the night. Keeping close proximity with a partner acts as a mate guarding technique as it minimises the likelihood of unfaithfulness by the male, and also assures their partner of her fidelity. As a result of the paternal confidence, the male is also more likely to stay and provide resources. In one study it was found that 73.7% of participants said that females are more likely to want to sleep together after sexual intercourse. Mate guarding is a very likely explanation to this, but it may also have the benefits of increasing the female's protection, potentially from male poachers.|$|E
