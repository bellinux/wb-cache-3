50|$|The {{bankruptcy}} of DSB in 2009 which bank {{was awarded a}} banking permit by DNB in 2005. Subsequent analysis showed {{that at the time}} the banking permit was awarded DSB's risk management still had serious flaws and also the continuity of its business model was deemed risky. Based on a plan of improvement and appointment of a supervisory board DNB issued the permit. After the demise of DSB {{it turned out that the}} supervisory board had little influence on the behaviour of its CEO <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dirk</b> Scheringa, the planned improvement of its risk management was far behind schedule and the change of its businessmodel also wasn't implemented.|$|R

40|$|The Institute {{acknowledges}} {{with gratitude}} {{and respect the}} attention given by the President {{to the issue of}} conflict. He has recognised and asked others to face up to "the deep and persistent concern about the threat which violence poses to our electoral process and indeed to the survival of the democratic system in general and to our unity and oneness " 1. This gives us encouragement in our work and a belief that the way is open for new ideas and for change, if only we can meet the challenge of identifying what needs to be done. The Institute gratefully acknowledges financial and moral support for this study from DFID, UNDP, USAID, and the World Bank.

The A-Team members made their collective living as soldiers of fortune, but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of {{the home}} of Dr. Benjamin Bennet Briggs on Crescenta Terrace, ca. 1885. The house is at center and is a long, single-story building with a wrap-around porch. There are two chimneys protruding from the dark roof and several doorways are visible {{around the perimeter of}} the house. Six people are standing in front of the house and all appear to be looking to the left. There are several large bushes in the foreground, and a tall mountain is visible in the background at right.; Dr. Benjamin Briggs built a long, low, one-story residence about 1882 in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains overlooking the La Crescenta valley. On a clear day one could see Catalina Island. For building material he used cement that was shipped around the Horn from Germany. Several members of the Briggs family are taking their ease on the porch supported by ten slender columns that stretches along the length of the house. The people, from left to right, are Carolyn C. Briggs, S. Paul Ward, Benjamin Briggs Ward, Irene Briggs Ward, Asel Briggs, and Dr. Benjamin Bennet Briggs. A garden of pampas grass and flowering shrubs borders the porch. Grape vines on the patio were brought from Persia by Dr. S. Lawrence Ward, Dr. Briggs' son-in-law, in 1885. At the time <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dirks</b> donated this photograph the house was still standing, at the top of Briggs Avenue, which leads from Foothill Boulevard up hill to the area known first as Crescenta Terrace, later as Briggs Terrace...|$|R
25|$|The A-Team {{has been}} {{broadcast}} {{all over the}} world; international response has been varied. In 1984, the main cast members of The A-Team, George Peppard, <b>Mr.</b> T, <b>Dirk</b> Benedict and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. George Peppard {{was the first to}} receive the invitation and thus thought the invite pertained only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined, leaving only Mr. T, Benedict and Schultz to visit the Netherlands. The immense turn-out for the stars was unpredicted, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released with the present actors in which Dwight Schultz apologized and thanked everyone that had attended.|$|R

Roberto's origins are debated; he is claimed to be the illegally adopted son of <b>Mrs.</b> Heidi Stein, <b>Dirk</b> Schiller, born on 13 June 1975 in Görlitz, who disappeared in March 1979, due to alleged physical similarities between <b>Dirk</b> and Leonardo <b>Mrs</b> Stein suspecting that her son might have been kidnapped at 3 years old by Stasi agents for Honecker's younger daughter.|$|R

In March 2006 she moved out of her old home and into a new retirement center, but needed the help of Luann, who asked Bernice, Brad, and Toni to help her move out. Dirk followed Toni to the home, and to impress and be near Toni, helped the moving job finish faster; however, when he picked up Mrs. Horner's clock, an envelope full of money fell out, which Dirk pocketed, intending to steal it. He was caught by Brad, he claimed it to be his, but when Brad swiped it at the perfect time to return to <b>Mrs.</b> Horner, <b>Dirk</b> turned his story around and claimed to have found the envelope in the clock and intended to return it to her. He would have been kicked out had Mrs. Horner not believed his lie. She later sold her old home to Nancy and Frank, who began renting to Brad.|$|R
50|$|The title character, Lt. Dirk Niblick, is tasked in each segment {{with helping}} friends through {{practical}} dilemmas {{through the use}} of mathematics. Episodes frequently center on outsmarting scam artists who use deceptive language to attempt to trick the protagonists out of money or property. Most episodes also feature Dirk having one or more telephone conversations with his mother. Supporting characters on the show include Dirk's two young friends, the brother-and-sister pair Fluff and Fold Noodleman, and <b>Dirk's</b> neighbor, <b>Mr.</b> Beasley. The <b>Dirk</b> Niblick segments are similar in appearance to the 1965 cartoon Roger Ramjet. This is because Fred Crippen animated for both, and Gary Owens voiced both title characters. The show was revived on Noggin for a few years before Noggin became half Nick Jr., half The N.|$|R
