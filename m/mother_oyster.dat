5000|$|Walt Disney engaged O'Malley {{to provide}} voices for {{animated}} {{films such as}} the Cockney coster in the [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" [...] sequence in Mary Poppins (1964); Cyril Proudbottom, Winkie, and a policeman in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949); {{and the role of}} Colonel Hathi and the vulture Buzzie in The Jungle Book (1967). His voice can be heard in Alice in Wonderland (1951), in which he performs all the character voices in [...] "The Walrus and the Carpenter" [...] segment (besides Alice), including Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Walrus, the Carpenter, and <b>Mother</b> <b>Oyster.</b> O'Malley also provided the voice of Br'er Fox in Song of the South (1946) when James Baskett was unavailable.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Walrus and the Carpenter" [...] song is sung by Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the 1951 Disney film Alice in Wonderland {{with the}} moon and the sun on each side and the oysters. The Walrus is portrayed as an intelligent, but lazy conman, with the Carpenter as a hardworking, but dimwitted sidekick who needs beating with a cane for acting before thinking. All {{characters}} in the story are voiced by J. Pat O'Malley. After the Carpenter discovers a family of oysters underwater, the Walrus tries to persuade them to come [...] "walk" [...] with them. The <b>Mother</b> <b>Oyster,</b> on the other hand, knows that the current month is March, one of the 8 months with the letter [...] "R" [...] in which oysters are eaten. She tries to convince her children to stay in the sea, but the Walrus (refusing to take no for an answer) shuts her up (literally) and leads the dozen curious, younger oysters in a Pied Piper-like dance and flute solo ashore, where the Carpenter builds a restaurant from a shipwreck on the beach in six seconds. Once everyone is inside, the Walrus (who somehow doesn't want to share) tricks the Carpenter into preparing some food so that he can eat all the oysters himself. When the Carpenter returns to find every last oyster devoured and that the Walrus has double-crossed him, his face turns red with anger and he chases the Walrus outside with his hammer. In the final parts of the film, the Walrus and the Carpenter are among those who join the Queen of Hearts into chasing after Alice.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the parentage of pearls nondestructively, {{the measurement of}} fluorescence spectra was applied to several kinds of pearls as well as shells. The fluorescence spectra of pearls and shells of genus Haliotis (abalone) were also measured together {{with those of other}} species of <b>mother</b> <b>oysters</b> used in pearl culturing. Experimental results indicate that some differences in the spectra make it possible for pearls of genus Haliotis to be distinguished from those of other <b>mother</b> <b>oysters...</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{measuring}} the fluorescence spectra of pearls from various species of <b>mother</b> <b>oysters,</b> a distinction has already become possible {{as to whether}} the pearls are from Pinctada fucata, Pinctada maxima. Pteria penguin or Pinctada margaritifera. In this study, the fluorescence of pearls from freshwater bivalves was measured. The results have made it possible to distinguish freshwater pearls from the other pearls mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|The fluoresence {{of pearls}} and shells of Pinctada margaritifera (black lip oyster) has been {{measured}} {{in order to}} distinguish the species of <b>mother</b> <b>oysters</b> which produce those pearls. A distinction is possible for pearls of P. margaritifera from those of Pinctada fucata and Pinctada maxima using {{a difference in the}} fluoresence spectra; this difference is caused by {{the presence or absence of}} porphyrin in pearls, respectively. However, the distinction between P. margaritifera and Pteria penguin, both of which have porphyrin in nacre, is difficult by measuring the fluorescence spectra. It is achieved by measuring the optical reflection spectra, since P. margaritifera shows a peculiar dip at 700 nm...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{spectra of}} pearls of Pinctada fucata (Japan's Akoya oyster) and Pinctada maxima (white lip oyster) have been {{measured}} {{in order to}} distinguish species of the <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> which produce that pearl. A distinction is possible for these pearls using {{the difference in the}} fluorescence spectra under N_ 2 laser excitation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{established}} experimentally that the inshore {{areas of the}} Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay bordering Mandapam Camp can profitably be used for <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> culture and cultured pearl production. The depth of the inshore waters of the Gulf of Mannar is comparatively deeper where the raft culture can be adopted from November to May. whereas, the nearshore waters of Palk Bay is shallow where rack {{can be used to}} farm the oysters from June to October, thus a continued farming is possible in all months in a calender year. Though the hydrological and environmental conditions of both the seas are almost same, it is found that Gulf of Mannar is better suited for <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> culture as indicated by the better growth rates of spat and oysters. If farming is done properly, high survival rates of spat, mother oysters and implanted oysters can be achieved with an enhanced rate of production of better quality cultured pearls...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{spectra of}} pearls and shells of Pteria penguin (mabe), Pinctada fucata (Japan's Akoya oyster) and Pinctada maxima (yellow lip oyster) have been measured {{in order to}} distinguish species of the <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> which produce that pearl. A distinction is possible for these pearls using differences in the fluorescence spectra. The spectral difference has been attributable to colouring matter or screloprotain in pearls and shells...|$|E
40|$|The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on {{successful}} {{development of}} an indigenous technology {{for the production of}} cultured pearls in India in 1973, felt the urgent need for the production of pearl oyster spat in the hatchery to meet the requirement of large scale production of <b>mother</b> <b>oysters</b> for surgery. The pearl fisheries history of India shows that the population of pearl oysters in the beds of the Gulf of Mannar and Gulf of Kutch had been unpredictable and unproductive during most part. For the pearl culture to blossom into an industry, an uninterrupted supply of oysters is a prerequisite. Pressed with this need, a team of scientists of the Molluscan Shellfish Hatchery at Tuticorin Research Centre of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute made a breakthrough in 1981 by producing the first spat of the Indian pearl oyster Pinctadafucata in the hatcher...|$|R
40|$|In India, {{research}} on marine pearl culture {{was started in}} 1972 and the first cultured marine pearl from Pinctada fucata was rolled out a year later through the earnest efforts of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi (CMFRI) at its Tuticorin Research Centre. Subsequently, improvements of the technology were made by various scientists involved at different centres of CMFRI focussing on different issues of marine pearl culture. Information on different aspects of marine pearl culture such as surveys for stock position, ecology of pearl beds, small scale experimental culture of <b>mother</b> <b>oysters,</b> surgical nucleation and spherical pearl and designer pearl production (‘mabe’) has already been published in various sources including few instances of technology transfers to entrepreneurs/fisher folk. Though, the experimental results were encouraging, anticipated technology transfer {{did not take place}} subsequently. Hence a large scale marine pearl culture demonstration was carried out and viability of the technology was redemonstrated at the Regional centre of CMFRI, Mandapam Camp during 1997 - 2003 through an ICAR Revolving Fund Project which resulted in wealth of information regarding different aspects of marine pearl culture. In the present account, the lessons learnt based on the published information as well as the data (unpublished) obtained in the large scale culture are analysed and classified under the critical activities of pearl culture and presented {{in the form of a}} ‘non systematic critical review’ essentially to arrive at the status of marine pearl culture in India...|$|R

Her father was a great-grandnephew of President James Monroe while her <b>mother</b> was an <b>Oyster</b> Bay Roosevelt and a descendant of the Schuyler family. She enjoyed a childhood of privilege and grew up on her parents' New Jersey estate. Travel and horseback rides were part of Corinne's childhood.|$|R
40|$|Indian {{pearl oyster}} {{belonging}} to the Genus Pinctada occurs in the two Gulf zones of India ie., Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat and Gulf of Mannar in Tamil Nadu. Commercial fishery existed in GoM till 1961 and then has gone into a dormant period due to many reasons including insignificant natural settlement of spat in the pearl beds (‘paars’) of Gulf of Mannar. To sustain a pearl culture industry, {{a steady supply of}} pearl oyster seed and farming it to mother oysters is a pre requisite. Large scale collection of pearl oyster spats either by using spat collectors or from their natural beds was not always found dependable owing to the irregular spat fall. Hence, hatchery production of pearl oyster seed and <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> culture has become an essential aspect as far as pearl culture is concerned. The following account details the basic hatchery requirement, broodstock maintenance and spawning and hatchery production of spats of Pinctada fucata and the methods of farming the spats for <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> development...|$|E
40|$|Marine pearl {{culture is}} a {{multifaceted}} technique involving three different kind of works namely i) seed production, ii) farming and <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> development and iii) nucleation and pearl production. To make the technique more viable and economically feasible {{it is imperative to}} make critical analysis of the various technicalities involved in the culture strategy. Hence a commercial level scheme on marine pearl culture in the inshore waters of Gulf of Mannar (GOM) was taken up during 1998 - 2004 at Mandapam Regional Centre of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). Critical analysis of the data revealed that a definite upgradation of pearl culture technology is required in many components coupled with policy decisions by the State Government. The present paper focuses on a single major problem of production of mother oysters for nucleation and pearl production on a continuous and commercial scale of operation. The culture method, appropriate farm management, stock density, growth and survival, culling and their effect on the production of <b>mother</b> <b>oyster</b> suitable for nucleation are presented in the paper...|$|E
