50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear wheel containing a drive assembly are attached, and an upright frame to which two reciprocating arm levers are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the drive assembly, which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider drive assembly is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each arm lever is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the rotating crank arm and in the front to the pivoting arm lever, moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and <b>multiple</b> <b>gearing.</b> It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} {{subject matter}} falling under the general heading of our Article {{is related to}} the Greek and European legislators 2 ̆ 7 reaction towards the negative consequences and unfair practices in which intragroup transactions may result. Such transactions may result in detriment to shareholders, employees, and creditors, {{as well as of the}} state 2 ̆ 7 s interests regarding taxation policies. Currently, these considerations are not fully addressed by the traditional legal regime in Greece; as a result, discussion is still in progress. At an EU level, the recent legislative initiatives-in particular Directive 2002 / 87 /EC on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings, and investment firms in a financial conglomerate-seek to introduce specific prudential legislation for financial conglomerates. These directives also take the first steps to align the legislation on the European level with national laws concerning financial groups and financial conglomerates in the same sector, thus ensuring a minimum level of equal treatment of these groups throughout the European Union. The main objective, however, of the new EU regime is to ensure that separate state regulators-who typically focus on one sector in order to ensure capital adequacy of the entities under their supervision-are not hindered because of the existence of cross-sector financial conglomerates. This requires specific measures which will prevent situations, for example, where capital is used at the same time as a buffer against risk in two or more entities belonging in the same financial conglomerate (2 ̆ 2 <b>multiple</b> <b>gearing</b> 2 ̆ 2) and situations where a parent company issues debt and directs the proceeds as equity to its regulated subsidiaries (2 ̆ 2 excessive leverage 2 ̆ 2).

The NuVinci {{is a new}} {{drivetrain}} targeted for use on bicycles, though Fallsworth is trying to adapt it for other uses. The large NuVinci hub uses a new technology, a 'continuously variable planetary' drive train, to allow <b>multiple</b> <b>gear</b> ratios while removing the gears. Thus, a derailleur and <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> are no longer necessary.

2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one gear and the gear ratio is fixed. Many {{contemporary}} bicycles have <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> and thus <b>multiple</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. A shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill.

40|$|Abstract. —Fisheries studies often employ <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> {{that result}} in large {{percentages}} of zero values. We considered a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with random effects to address these excessive zeros. By employing a Bayesian ZIP model that simultaneously incorporates data from <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> to analyze data from the Missouri River, {{we were able to}} compare gears and make more year, segment, and macrohabitat comparisons than did the original data analysis. For channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, our results rank (highest to lowest) the mean catch per unit area (CPUA) for gears (beach seine, benthic trawl, electrofishing, and drifting trammel net); years (1998 and 1997); macrohabitats (tributary mouth, connected secondary channel, nonconnected secondary channel, and bend); and river segment zones (channelized, inter-reservoir, and least-altered). For shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, the mean CPUA was significantly higher for benthic trawls and drifting trammel nets; 1998 and 1997; tributary mouths, bends, and connected secondary channels; and some channelized or least-altered inter-reservoir segments. One important advantage of our approach is the ability to reliably infer patterns of relative abundance by means of <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> without using gear efficiencies. The problem of a large proportion of zero values is common with data obtained from ecological studie...|$|R

50|$|On a bicycle, the cogset or {{cluster is}} {{the set of}} {{multiple}} sprockets that attaches to the hub on the rear wheel. A cogset works with a rear derailleur to provide <b>multiple</b> <b>gear</b> ratios to the rider. Cogsets come in two varieties, freewheels or cassettes, of which cassettes are a newer development. Although cassettes and freewheels perform the same function and look almost the same when installed, they have important mechanical differences and are not interchangeable.|$|R

40|$|Recently, system architects {{have built}} low-power, {{high-performance}} clusters, such as Green Destiny. The idea behind these clusters {{is to improve}} the energy efficiency of nodes. However, these clus-ters save power at the expense of performance. Our approach is instead to use high-performance cluster nodes that are frequency-and voltage-scalable; energy can than be saved by scaling down the CPU. Our prior work has examined {{the costs and benefits of}} executing an entire application at a single reduced frequency. This paper presents a framework for executing a single applica-tion in several frequency-voltage settings. The basic idea is to first divide programs into phases and then execute a series of experi-ments, with each phase assigned a prescribed frequency. During each experiment, we measure energy consumption and time and then use a heuristic to choose the assignment of frequency to phase for the next experiment. Our results show that significant energy can be saved without an undue performance penalty; particularly, our heuristic finds assign-ments of frequency to phase that is superior to any fixed-frequency solution. Specifically, this paper shows that more than half of the NAS benchmarks exhibit a better energy-time tradeoff using mul-tiple gears than using a single gear. For example, IS using <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> uses 9 % less energy and executes in 1 % less time than the closest single-gear solution. Compared to no frequency scaling, <b>multiple</b> <b>gear</b> IS uses 16 % less energy while executing only 1 % longer...|$|R
30|$|In the end, {{the weight}} of {{widespread}} use of a new technology in society can ultimately force a ruling body to accept a contentious technology. For example, the rear derailleur used on a bicycle is a mechanism used to change gear by driving a chain across a series of wheel mounted sprockets on a bicycle. This innovation was not allowed into the Tour de France until some 40  years after its invention which was years after its initial introduction into commercial bicycles (Trabal 2008). The races director {{argued that it was}} dishonest and unfair and insinuated that possessing <b>multiple</b> <b>gears</b> degraded the challenge of the event (Trabal 2008).|$|R
50|$|A pair of {{independent}} treadle mechanisms collected {{power from the}} rider's legs instead of a crank. Power from each treadle {{was transferred to the}} rear wheel by a leather strap over a ratchet mechanism. (See image in gallery below.) The attachment point of the leather strap could be moved to provide <b>multiple</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, and both treadles could be pressed simultaneously for a brief increase in torque. A spring attached to the ratchet rewound the strap when the foot was raised. This treadle arrangement also allowed riders of different sizes to ride the same bike comfortably without modification, as the pedals were not constrained to trace a circle about an axle.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} motion of a {{planetary}} gear structure {{is different from}} traditional parallel gears. Traditional gears rely on {{a small number of}} contact points between two gears to squeeze as the driving force, where all the loadings are concentrated on a few contacting surfaces, making the gears easy to wear and crack. But the planetary speed reducer has six gear contacting surfaces with a larger area that can distribute the loading evenly over 360 degrees. <b>Multiple</b> <b>gear</b> surfaces share the instantaneous impact loading evenly which make them more resistant to the impact from higher torque. The housing and bearing parts will not be damaged and crack due to high loading.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{comprehensive}} methodology for calculating load sharing in multiple tooth contact is presented {{based on the}} experimental stress-optical method of caustics.

The load sharing factor (LSF) is calculated using well-established mathematical formulae from the photographs of the transmitted caustics and the obtained results are compared with the pertinent International Organisation for Standardisation and American Gear Manufacturers Association standards with which good agreement is verified.
