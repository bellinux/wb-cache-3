Ciliwung River is one of the significant contributors to flood discharge in Jakarta. Flood control in Jakarta area requires a very hard effort, considering the geological conditions which is an area of the basin and hydrological conditions are very vulnerable to inundation because bypassed by many rivers from upstream. Changes in land use that was once empty land converted to settlements, housing, and the building also has occurred both in the upstream and downstream along the rivers that pass through Jakarta. After an evaluation of watershed and watershed Krukut Sunter which is around Ciliwung watershed, it was found that there were streams of the watershed around the exit and entry into the Ciliwung watershed. These rivers flood contributed by ± 25 % of the Ciliwung watershed resulting in widespread inundation in Jakarta increases. One of the efforts to control flooding in Jakarta is the construction of weirs Katulampa which serves as an early information system to flooding Ciliwung will enter Jakarta. From the evaluation of the function obtained Katulampa weir water level to Alert 1 is 200 - 250 cm to estimate flood discharge using HEC-HMS at 733 m 3 / s. Data on the water level in the dam Katulampa estimates that approximately 9 - 10 hours later flood will arrive in Jakarta. The ability of the dam to divert water when it reaches Alert 1 of 7 % of the flood discharge through the doors retrieval. In order to optimize the function of the weir and re-plan the weir, the initial step is the hydrological analysis with the result that be discovered gauge the dependable discharge, needs water discharge and flood discharge. In the Katulampa weir planning dependable discharge used is the discharge with probability 80 %. Water needs value to fulfill the irrigation water requirement is 1. 87 liters / sec / ha or water needs discharge for water irrigation is 6. 03 m 3 / sec. Flood discharge by the method of HEC-HMS for the return period of 25 years at 733. 90 m 3 / sec is used as the basis to design the main building weirs.

Therefore the current focus of the researchers in agricultural domain is to find sugar beet cultivars that are highly resistant to CLS. To measure their resistance, CLS is manually observed and rated in a large variety of sugar beet by different human experts over a period of a few months. Unfortunately, this procedure is laborious and subjective. There-fore, we propose a novel computer vision system, CLS Rater, to automatically and accurately rate CLS of plant images in the real field to the “USDA scale ” of 0 to 10. Given a set of plant images captured by a tractor-mounted camera, CLS Rater extracts multi-scale superpixels, where in each scale a novel histogram of importances feature representation is proposed to encode both the within-superpixel local and across-superpixel global appearance variations. These features at different superpixel scales are then fused for learning a <b>bagging</b> <b>M</b> 5 P regressor that estimates the rating for each plant image. We test our system on the field data collected over a period of two months under different day lighting and weather conditions. Experimental results show CLS Rater to be highly consistent with a rating error of 0. 65, which demonstrates higher consistency than the rating standard deviation of 1. 31 by the human experts.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 95 - 97. A major {{obstacle}} to calculating Feynman diagrams in field theories, confined to a cavity, {{has always been the}} divergent loop diagrams. So far, only the quantum chromodynamic and electrodynamic self-energies of a ls 1 / 2 quark, confined to a static spherical cavity, have been accurately calculated. These quantities are of immediate interest in the <b>M.</b> I. T. <b>bag</b> model. The existing methods to calculate loop diagrams are based on the multiple reflection scheme, in which the zero reflection term is separated out analytically, and evaluated separately. Thus far, there are some indications that this method is unsuitable for the quadratically divergent one loop vacuum polarization. In this thesis we firstly develop a set of Fourier transforms, appropriate to a discussion of renormalization in a cavity. Using these, we renormalize the cavity propagators to one loop for scalar, Dirac, and gauge fields. We then introduce a new computational method to subtract out the divergences, based on dimensional regularization. Using this method, we present results for various loop diagrams. The scalar φ⁴ theory is used as a pedagogical example. We then present the quark self-energy for several low lying cavity modes. Finally we tackle the long standing and hitherto unresolved question of the vacuum polarization. For this we give a detailed discussion of surface divergences, and present results for scalar quantum electrodynamics. We make a suggestion for the implementation of the running coupling constant in the cavity...|$|R
