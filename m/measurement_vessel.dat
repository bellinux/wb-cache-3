The mathematical model is considered for uniform and non-uniform volume structure of the product. The pores on the surface are smaller then in the depth of a flat surface. The indirect ultrasonic measurement method is proposed for investigation of porous plates. The porosity of a product is evaluated by absorbed liquid volume versus time using this method. The volume of the absorbed liquid is calculated according to the liquid level in the cylindrical <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel</b> versus time. The level of liquid is measured by acoustical echolocation method through air. The <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel</b> construction was improved for planar objects. The obtained uncertainty in distance measurements till the liquid surface is five micrometers in the forty millimeters measurement interval. The focusing electroacoustical transducers were used for investigations. The experimentally tested technique allows to apply acoustic method for various porous plates structures investigations when others methods give results with great uncertainties. This article can be beneficial for researchers, who specialize in evaluation of porous structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The FAO International Plan of Action on the {{management}} of fishing capacity calls for all member states to provide estimates of the total capacity of their fleets by 2001. In the UK, a “capacity ” measurement system is currently in place, based on vessel size and engine power. An assumption is made that this measure {{is related to the}} harvesting ability of the fleet, and is the basis of the existing capacity reduction programs. In this paper, the harvesting capacity of a sample of UK otter trawls and netter-liners is estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates are made on a species by species basis for the key species harvested. These are compared to the existing measures of physical capacity. Implications for capacity management based on the physical measures, given the results, are drawn. Keywords: Capacity, Capacity <b>measurement,</b> <b>vessel</b> capacity units, DEA. 1...|$|E
40|$|Slurry {{rheology}} is {{an important}} property in many mineral processing systems, but its influence is not well understood and it is rarely incorporated into process design, analysis or optimisation. One {{reason for this is}} the difficulty of measuring rheology (particularly in plants) and of interpreting the output of such measurements. This paper presents a new procedure for obtaining a full shear rate-shear stress flow curve for unstable slurries using the single bobbin Debex on-line viscometer. It is based on the use of a calibration algorithm which incorporates a correction for turbulent flow in the <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel.</b> It is shown that torque coefficient data from a variety of Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian slurries fall on a single curve, and it is suggested that this calibration curve (the "TC curve") is characteristic for a particular instrument configuration. In principle, it can be easily determined using Newtonian fluids alone. It is shown that the Debex on-line viscometer gives flow curves very similar to a conventional laboratory viscometer when this procedure is applied...|$|E

40|$|The power {{generation}} industry {{throughout the world}} stands to gain significantly from process improvements and optimization which can potentially lead to cleaner production of cost effective electricity. The efficient operation of lignite-based tangentially-fired combustion systems, as commonly used in Victoria, Australia, depends on critical issues such as ignition and combustion of the fuel, which are largely controlled by burner aerodynamics. The geometry of the burner and the ratio of velocities between the primary and secondary jets {{play an important role}} in achieving stable combustion, high burnout of fuel, low production of pollutants and control of fouling. Slot-burners are vertically aligned stacks of rectangular nozzles delivering primary fuel and secondary air jets, and are commonly used in tangentially-fired boilers. To obtain a better understanding of the overall combustion process, it is important to understand the aerodynamics of jet development from these burners. This paper reports an experimental investigation into the aerodynamics of a recessed rectangular slot-burner of the type used in the Yallourn stage- 2 tangentially-fired furnace. The 1 : 15 scale model burner consisted of a central (primary) rectangular fuel nozzle with two secondary rectangular air jets positioned above and below it. The burner jets were at an angle of 60 &# 0176; to the wall and were diffused and mixed in a recess before entering into the <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel.</b> A cross-flow jet was attached to the wall of the vessel to simulate the recirculation similar to tangentially-fired furnaces. Experiments for both single and two-phase flow were performed. For single-phase flow, the air flow was seeded with a fine mist of sugar particles (mean diameter 1 &# 0956;m) introduced into the primary, secondary and cross-flow ducts. For two-phase flow, solid glass spheres (mean diameter 66 &# 0956;m, density 2450 kg/m 3) were used as the representative of the coal particles and were introduced only at the centre of the primary duct from a bubbling fluidized bed. Experiments were conducted using a primary to cross-flow jet velocity ratio (&# 0966;) of 1. 0 and secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (&# 0981;) of 1. 0 and 3. 0 as found in real furnaces. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was used to measure mean and turbulent velocity components in the near field and downstream regions of the jets. The flow pattern inside the recess was very complex and greatly influenced the flow where it entered the <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel.</b> For single-phase flow and &# 0981; = 1. 0, the jets diverged completely from the geometric axis of the burner and attached to the wall. The degree of deflection of the lower secondary jet was slightly more than the primary jet. For &# 0981; = 3. 0, after exiting from the nozzle, the primary jet diffused outwards and mixed with the higher momentum secondary jets in the recess and came out with the secondary jets. For two-phase flow and &# 0981; = 1. 0, in the mixing region between the primary and cross-flow jet, the gas-phase velocities were higher than the particle-phase. Further downstream the peak velocities of the particle-phase slightly deviated and occurred farther from the wall. For &# 0981; = 3. 0, downstream of the nozzle there was a tendency of separation for the gas-phase near the wall while the particle-phase was attached to the wall...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative meta-analyses of {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} investigating the specific therapeutic efficacy of homeopathic remedies yielded {{statistically significant differences}} compared to placebo. Since the remedies used contained mostly only very low concentrations of pharmacologically active compounds, these effects cannot be accounted for {{within the framework of}} current pharmacology. Theories to explain clinical effects of homeopathic remedies are partially based upon changes in diluent structure. To investigate the latter, we measured for the first time high-field (600 / 500 MHz) 1 H T 1 and T 2 nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times of H 2 O in homeopathic preparations with concurrent contamination control by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Homeopathic preparations of quartz (10 c– 30 c, n[*]=[*] 21, corresponding to iterative dilutions of 100 − 10 – 100 − 30), sulfur (13 x– 30 x, n[*]=[*] 18, 10 − 13 – 10 − 30), and copper sulfate (11 c– 30 c, n[*]=[*] 20, 100 − 11 – 100 − 30) were compared to n[*]=[*] 10 independent controls each (analogously agitated dilution medium) in randomized and blinded experiments. In none of the samples, the concentration of any element analyzed by ICP-MS exceeded 10 ppb. In the first measurement series (600 MHz), there was a significant increase in T 1 for all samples as a function of time, and {{there were no significant differences}} between homeopathic potencies and controls. In the second measurement series (500 MHz) 1 year after preparation, we observed statistically significant increased T 1 relaxation times for homeopathic sulfur preparations compared to controls. Fifteen out of 18 correlations between sample triplicates were higher for controls than for homeopathic preparations. No conclusive explanation for these phenomena can be given at present. Possible hypotheses involve differential leaching from the <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel</b> walls or a change in water molecule dynamics, i. e., in rotational correlation time and/or diffusion.

Patients were classified into 1 of 3 groups: stage 1 and 2 (Group 1), stage 3 not requiring treatment (Group 2), and stage 3 requiring treatment (Group 3). Diameter and tortuosity of the 4 major temporal retinal arteries and veins close to the optic disk were quantified. Tortuosity was measured as central (within 2 disk diameters {{from the center of}} the optic disk) and paracentral (from 2 to 4 disk diameters). For Group 3, <b>measurements</b> of <b>vessels</b> immediately before treatment and all follow-up post-treatment <b>measurements</b> of <b>vessels</b> were analyzed. Results: Differences in central and paracentral arteriolar tortuosity were pronounced. The average central arteriolar tortuosities were 1. 12 ± 0. 018 for Group 1, 1. 13 ± 0. 018 for Group 2, and 1. 32 ± for Group 3; the paracentral arteriolar tortuosities were 1. 11 ± 0. 019 for Group 1, 1. 12 ± 0. 019 for Group 2, and 1. 31 ± 0. 02 for Group 3. In the post-treatment analysis of Group 3 patients, significant reductions in all vascular measurements were observed compared to pre-treatment, except for central and paracentral vein tortuosity. Conclusions: Computerized systems can be used to objectively assess differences in vascular parameters between ROP stages.

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} two years results of the {{research}} on the development of advanced electrochemical techniques for use in supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) environments. The SCWO technology was found to be a promising approach to treat a variety of hazardous wastes. However, the corrosion processes in the SCWO reactors is still a problem for further development of this technology. The authors have developed a flow-through electrochemical cell (FTEC) which allows us to monitor the corrosion process in real time at temperatures up to 500 C and pressures up to 400 bar. The FTEC consists of a flow-through Ag/AgCl external pressure-balanced reference electrode, a flow-through platinum hydrogen electrode, an yttria-stabilized zirconia pH sensor and an electrochemical noise sensor. The new FTEC has been designed to serve as a <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel</b> for the high temperature and high pressure circulation once-through flow loop and titanium alloy was chosen as the construction material. The FTEC, shown schematically in Figure 1, is used for the experiments. Two HPLC pumps are employed in the system, one for pumping the reaction solution through the loop and the other for pumping the reference solution through the reference electrode. The system pressure is sustained as a constant via a back pressure regulator. The temperature was measured using a thermocouple installed {{at the center of the}} FTEC. Because many physico-chemical processes, including corrosion, are sensitive to the pH, the measurement and control of pH is very important for the high temperature SCWO environment. The authors have measured the potentials of the FTEC for several HCl(aq) + NaCl(aq) solutions of different concentrations of HCl(aq) and derived the corresponding pH differences (DeltapH) over a wide range of temperatures at pressure around 350 bar. Comparison of the experimentally derived and theoretically calculated DpH values presented in Figure 2 clearly demonstrates the ability to measure pH with a high accuracy (better than 610. 05 pH units). This result also shows the viability of the developed FTEC as a versatile potentiometric system for use at supercritical temperatures. During the next year of the project they will address the problem of electrochemical noise measurements and monitoring corrosion processes that occur on metallic materials exposed to super critical water. ...|$|E
40|$|The figure depicts {{selected}} {{aspects of}} an apparatus for testing thermal-insulation materials for cryogenic systems at temperatures and under vacuum or atmospheric conditions representative of those encountered in use. This apparatus, called "Cryostat- 100," {{is based on}} the established cryogen-boil-off calorimeter method, according to which the amount of heat that passes through an insulation specimen to a cryogenic fluid in a container, and thus the effective thermal conductance of the specimen, is taken to be proportional to the amount of the cryogenic fluid that boils off from the container. The design of Cryostat- 100 is based partly on, and incorporates improvements over, the design of a similar prior apparatus called "Cryostat- 1 " described in "Improved Methods of Testing Cryogenic Insulation Materials" (KSC- 12107 & KSC- 12108), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 24, No. 12 (December 2000), page 46. The design of Cryostat- 100 also incorporates the best features of two other similar prior apparatuses called "Cryostat- 2 " (also described in the cited prior article) and "Cryostat- 4. " Notable among the improvements in Cryostat- 100 is the addition of a lifting mechanism that enables safe, rapid, reliable insertion and removal of insulation specimens and facilitates maintenance operations that involve lifting. As in Cryostat- 1, the cold mass is a vertical stainless-steel cylindrical vessel subdivided into a larger <b>measurement</b> <b>vessel</b> with smaller thermal-guard vessels at both ends. During operation, all three vessels are kept filled with liquid nitrogen near saturation at ambient pressure (temperature. 77. 4 K). The cold mass of Cryostat- 100 has a length of 1 m and diameter of 168 mm. Each specimen has a corresponding nominal length and inner diameter and a nominal thickness of 25. 4 mm. Specimens that are shorter and have thicknesses between 0 and 50 mm are also acceptable. Bulk-fill, foam, clam-shell, multilayer insulation, and layered materials can be tested over a very wide range of thermal transmission: apparent thermal conductivity from 0. 01 to 60 mW/m-K and heat flux from 0. 1 to 500 W/sq m. A test in Cryostat- 100 can be conducted at any desired gas pressure between ambient atmospheric pressure at one extreme and a vacuum with residual pressure < 10 (exp - 5) torr (< 1. 33 10 (exp - 3) Pa) at the other extreme. The residual gas (and purge gas) is typically nitrogen, but can be any suitable purge gas (e. g., helium, argon, or carbon dioxide). Usually, the temperature on the warm boundary of the insulation specimen is maintained near the ambient value (approximately 293 K), while the boiling of liquid nitrogen at atmospheric pressure in the cold mass maintains the temperature on the cold boundary of the specimen at approximately 77 K...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the impact of phase errors in time averaged PC-MR imaging of the cerebral vasculature and explore the effects of three common correction schemes (local bias correction (LBC), local polynomial correction (LPC), and whole brain polynomial correction (WBPC)). Measurements of the eddy current induced phase error from a static phantom were first obtained. In thirty healthy human subjects, the methods were then assessed in background tissue to determine if local phase offsets could be removed. Finally, the techniques were used to correct VFR <b>measurements</b> in cerebral <b>vessels</b> and compared statistically. In the phantom, phase error was measured to be < 2. 1 ml/s per pixel and the bias was reduced with the correction schemes. In background tissue, the bias was significantly reduced, by 65. 6 % (LBC), 58. 4 % (LPC) and 47. 7 % (WBPC) (p < 0. 001 across all schemes). Correction did not lead to significantly different VFR <b>measurements</b> in the <b>vessels</b> (p = 0. 997). In the <b>vessel</b> <b>measurements,</b> the three correction schemes led to flow measurement differences of - 0. 04 ± 0. 05 ml/s, 0. 09 ± 0. 16 ml/s, and - 0. 02 ± 0. 06 ml/s. Although there was an improvement in background measurements with correction, there was no statistical difference between the three correction schemes (p = 0. 242 in background and p = 0. 738 in vessels).

In addition, image quality may be hampered by respiratory and cardiac motion artefacts. In order to overcome these limitations an ECG- and navigator-gated high-resolution-MRA sequence (HR-MRA) with slow infusion of extracellular contrast agent was implemented at 3 Tesla {{for the assessment of}} congenital heart disease and compared to standard first-pass-MRA (FP-MRA). Methods 34 patients (median age: 13 years) with congenital heart disease (CHD) were prospectively examined on a 3 Tesla system.

It may be integrated into a standard CMR-protocol for patients with CHD without the need for additional contrast agent injection and without any additional examination time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective. Recent {{findings}} support the crucial role of microcirculatory disturbance and ischemia for hearing impairment especially after noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The {{aim of this study}} was to establish an animal model for in vivo analysis of cochlear microcirculation and hearing function after a loud noise to allow precise measurements of both parameters in vivo. Study Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Animal study. Subjects and Methods. After assessment of normacusis (0 minutes) using evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), noise (106 -dB sound pressure level [SPL]) was applied to both ears in 6 guinea pigs for 30 minutes while unexposed animals served as controls. In vivo fluorescence microscopy of the stria vascularis capillaries was performed after surgical exposure of 1 cochlea. ABR measurements were derived from the contralateral ear. Results. After noise exposure, red blood cell velocity was reduced significantly by 24. 3 % (120 minutes) and further decreased to 44. 5 % at the end of the observation (210 minutes) in contrast to stable control <b>measurements.</b> <b>Vessel</b> diameters were not affected in both groups. A gradual decrease of segmental blood flow became significant (38. 1 %) after 150 minutes compared with controls. Hearing thresholds shifted significantly from 20. 0 ± 5. 5 dB SPL (0 minutes) to 32. 5 ± 4. 2 dB SPL (60 minutes) only in animals exposed to loud noise. Conclusion. With regard to novel treatments targeting the stria vascularis in NIHL, this standardized model allows us to analyze in detail cochlear microcirculation and hearing function in vivo.

40|$|Accurate <b>measurement</b> of <b>vessel</b> diameters on retinal images {{plays an}} {{important}} part in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and early signs of certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. In this study we develop new method based on computer aided to determine the width of retinal blood vessels by analysing the color fundus image. Retinal vessel diameter was measured based on blood vessel wall estimating on the digital fundus image. We suggested a dependable and accurate technique to determine the diameter (width) of retinal blood vessel based on suggested mask created to use specifically on measuring the blood vessel diameter. The suggested system starts by removing the bifurcations and determine the width for each blood vessel segment. Suggested algorithm tested and gives accurate and promised results...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of tumour angiogenesis {{is of great}} importance in cancer research, as is the tumour response to vascular-targeted drugs. This paper presents software aimed at aiding these investigations and other situations where linear or dendritic structures are to be delineated from three-dimensional (3 D) data sets. This software application was written to analyse the data from 3 D data sets by allowing the manual and semi-automated tracking and delineation of the vascular tree, including the <b>measurement</b> of <b>vessel</b> diameter. A new algorithm, CHARM, based on a compact Hough transform {{and the formation of}} a radial map, has been used to locate vessel centres and measure diameters automatically. The robustness of this algorithm to image smoothing and noise has been investigated...|$|R
