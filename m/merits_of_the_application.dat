25|$|Another problem (also {{compounded}} {{by the absence of}} implementing legislation) is the apparent lack of understanding by many judges in Mexico of the law of the Convention. Mexican judges frequently seem to ignore the fact that a case before them arises out of a return application under the Convention, and instead simply apply the procedural and substantive law that would govern a Mexican custody dispute. The result is almost always that those courts deny return without evaluating the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> under the law of the Convention.

40|$|Retinal {{blurring}} {{resulting from}} the human eye's depth of focus {{has been shown to}} assist visual perception. Infinite focal depth within stereoscopically displayed virtual environments may cause undesirable effects, for instance, objects positioned at a distance in front of or behind the observer's fixation point will be perceived in sharp focus with large disparities thereby causing diplopia. Although published research on incorporation of synthetically generated Depth of Field (DoF) suggests that this might act as an enhancement to perceived image quality, no quantitative testimonies of perceptional performance gains exist. This {{may be due to the}} difficulty of dynamic generation of synthetic DoF where focal distance is actively linked to fixation distance. In this paper, such a system is described. A desktop stereographic display is used to project a virtual scene in which synthetically generated DoF is actively controlled from vergence-derived distance. A performance evaluation experiment on this system which involved subjects carrying out observations in a spatially complex virtual environment was undertaken. The virtual environment consisted of components interconnected by pipes on a distractive background. The subject was tasked with making an observation based on the connectivity of the components. The effects of focal depth variation in static and actively controlled focal distance conditions were investigated. The results and analysis are presented which show that performance gains may be achieved by addition of synthetic DoF. The <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of synthetic DoF are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, {{also known}} as fire grants or the FIRE Act grant program, was {{established}} by Title XVII of the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (P. L. 106 - 398). Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. A related program is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters (SAFER) program, which provides grants for hiring, recruiting, and retaining firefighters. The fire grant program {{is now in its}} 13 th year. The Fire Act statute was reauthorized in 2012 (Title XVIII of P. L. 112 - 239) and provides new guidelines on how fire grant money should be distributed. There is no set geographical formula for the distribution of fire grants—fire departments throughout the nation apply, and award decisions are made by a peer panel based on the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> and the needs of the community. However, the law does require that fire grants be distributed to a diverse mix of fire departments, with respect to type of department (paid, volunteer, or combination), geographic location, and type of community served (e. g., urban, suburban, or rural). For FY 2012, P. L. 112 - 74, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, provided $ 675 million for firefighter assistance, including $ 337. 5 million for AFG and $ 337. 5 million for SAFER. The Administration’s FY 2013 budget proposed $ 670 million for firefighter assistance, including $ 335 million for AFG and $ 335 million for SAFER. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P. L. 112 - 175), funds firefighter assistance programs through {{the first six months of}} FY 2013 at an increase of 0. 612 % of the FY 2012 level. Therefore, under the FY 2013 continuing resolution, AFG is funded at $ 339. 5 million and SAFER is funded at $ 339. 5 million through March 2013. The 113 th Congress will likely consider FY 2013 and FY 2014 budget appropriations for AFG and SAFER. As is the case with many federal programs, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact budget levels for AFG and SAFER. At the same time, firefighter assistance budgets will likely receive heightened scrutiny from the fire community, given the local budgetary cutbacks that many fire departments are facing...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} a {{personality}} theory known as the Enneagram and evaluate its potential in developing interpersonal communication in organisational context. For this, an action-oriented case study is conducted. The Enneagram theory is a typology of nine personality types. The types focus on core motivation, which is suggested to determine how different people direct their attention and resources, how they interpret and process information, and consequently, how they communicate. Since the Enneagram {{in its present form}} is a relatively new system, it has been only partially, yet not conclusively validated. Such being the case, there are no operational tools available for measuring or testing hypothesis regarding the types. It thus follows that this study is subjectivist in nature (as opposed to objectivist or nomothetic), i. e. aims to produce data that helps to understand, describe and evaluate <b>the</b> suggested advantage <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> Enneagram as a communication tool. The case study setting is conducted by focusing on two aspects: communicational style of each subject, as well as communicational relationships within the team. Both aspects are examined in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enneagram theory to evaluate whether <b>the</b> propositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine personality types offer a constructive tool for understanding and working with different communication styles. The main method for examining the two key aspects is conducting pair interviews. In <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case study evidence, the results suggest that the Enneagram has potential in developing interpersonal communication. This notion is supported by the case study subjects' own views on <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enneagram <b>application.</b> However, due to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> holistic Enneagram theory an the subsequent methods, <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> making scientifically legitimate generalisations is very limited. As a conclusive note, it is then suggested that there is "weak evidence" to support <b>the</b> proposition <b>of</b> Enneagram advantage in developing interpersonal communication in organisations, while the need for further studies is also clearly acknowledged.
