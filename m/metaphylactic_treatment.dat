40|$|Calfhood {{diseases}} have a {{major impact}} on the economic viability of cattle operations. The second of this three part review series considers the management of diarrhoeic diseases in pre-weaned calves. In neonatal calf diarrhoea, oral rehydration therapy is the single most important therapeutic measure to be carried out by the farmer and is usually successful if instigated immediately after diarrhoea has developed. Continued feeding of milk or milk replacer to diarrhoeic calves is important, to prevent malnourishment and weight loss in affected calves. Indiscriminative antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged, whereas systemically ill calves can benefit from systemic antibiotic treatment for the prevention of septicaemia or concurrent diseases. Ancillary treatments and specific preventive measures are discussed. Eimeriosis has a high economic impact on the farming industries due to direct cost of treatment and calf losses, but especially due to decreased performance of clinically as well as sub-clinically affected animals. Emphasis lies on prophylactic or <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment,</b> since the degree of damage to the intestinal mucosa once diarrhoea has developed, makes therapeutic intervention unrewarding...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} Butafosfan, a component of Catosal®, in the <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> of stress in pigs. Four 6 -week-old female littermates were taken from 12 litters. They were confronted with a pig from a different litter for 2 h. There were 24 pairs, each consisting of confronting two unfamiliar pigs in a new pen. This housing of unfamiliar pigs provides a good, but simple, model of the psychosocial stress that pigs experience when housed in large groups on pig farms. Immediately before being housed with an unfamiliar pig, 12 pairs of pigs were injected subcutaneously with Catosal® at a dose equivalent to 20 mg Butafosfan per kg body weight; the other 12 pairs received the control solution containing all ingredients of Catosal® except Butafosfan. The frequency and duration of aggressive behavior and the salivary cortisol response were measured during the first 2 h of the encounter. No adverse effects associated with Catosal® were observed.

BRD is a multifaceted group of pathogens, both viral and bacterial, that take advantage of an immune compromised calf to cause disease. This study took aim at comparing <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> for BRD in both the feedlot and pasture setting. In the feedlot study, heifers (n= 579, 403. 7 ± 27. 4 lbs) from Southwest Texas were identified as being high risk for BRD and shipped to the Clayton Livestock Research Center in Clayton, NM. Cattle were randomly allocated within truck load lots into 18 to 20 head treatment pens (30 pens; 3 treatments; 10 reps). Cattle were given one of three <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatments</b> based on the randomly assigned treatment for their pen within a replicate. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were fed a typical commercial starter diet for the first 56 - 60 d with a step-up ration change at day 28. At the end of the feeding period, pens were weighed and body weights recorded. Dry Matter Intake, morbidity, and mortality were recorded by CLRC personnel daily. Cattle administered tulathromycin had higher daily gains than cattle administered gamithromycin by 0. 29 lbs/d (P<. 01) and tended (P= 0. 09) have higher daily gains than cattle that received tilmicosin by 0. 18 lbs/d. Tulathromycin treated cattle tended (P = 0. 12) to have improved feed efficiency compared to gamithromycin treated cattle. Cattle that received tulathromycin (5. 2 %) had lower morbidity rates (P <. 02) than tilmicosin (14. 6 %) and gamithromycin (12. 79 %) treated cattle. There were no treatment differences in dry matter intake or mortality in cattle. For the wheat pasture study, heifers (n= 120, 393. 2 ± 28. 6 lbs) from the same origin and risk were shipped to the CLRC and processed before being trailed to a nearby wheat pasture. Cattle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (3 treatments, 40 reps), and were given one of three <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were allowed to graze on wheat for 54 days with free-choice Hi-Pro mineral mixed with Lasalocid, an ionophore. After 54 days on wheat pasture, the cattle were trailed back to the CLRC facilities and final individual weights were recorded. Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily by CLRC personnel. No differences were identified for ADG (P= 0. 98), morbidity (P= 0. 46) or mortality (P= 0. 36) among the three treatment groups...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to compare in two APP-problem herds the {{efficiency}} and profitability of a single-dose -injection of Tulathromycin with the usual feed medication of Amoxicillin resp. Tetracycline for metaphylaxis after weaning resp. starting fattening. The clinical trial was conducted from October 2007 to May 2008 in a farrow to wean herd (two series of 686 weaned piglets) and in an independent fattening herd (one series of 603 pigs), both with the repeated occurrence of acute Pleuropneumonia by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). After weaning resp. herd addition for fattening pigs were separated to different pens or stable rows for alternative metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin by a single i. m. -injection or of Amoxicillin-Trihydrat (weaned piglets) resp. of Tetracycline-HCL (fattening pigs) by oral feed medication of 7 days {{on the basis of}} preceding resistograms. With consideration for the farm owners only every 6 th or 10 th pig served as a non treated control (risk of losses). For space and feeding reasons (oral medications) these controls had to be housed in the same pens as the Tulathromycin medicated pigs. Objectives of this trial were kind and frequency of diseases and losses, growing performance (daily weight gain) and frequency of unsaleable pigs at delivery for fattening resp. slaughtering, as well as costs for drug treatments during the total growing period and for the growing delay. In addition, a sample of 280 weaned pigs was bleeded four times until delivery in order to control associations of C-Reactive-Proteine (CRP) and herd health resp. efficiency of metaphylaxis. Respiratory diseases and losses did not occur during their effective period. Afterwards the incidence of sporadically diseased pigs with different symptoms varied over time between 0 % an 19 % in weaned pigs resp. 1. 5 % and 6 % in fattening pigs without significant group differences. Losses in weaned pigs ranged from 0 to 5. 1 % and in fattening pigs significantly (p< 0. 05) from 1. 2 % resp. 1. 6 % (<b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatments)</b> and 9. 3 % (untreated controls). At {{the end of the first}} weaner series, in the 7 th week, only the Amoxicillin-group was affected by an acute APP-infection with 93. 5 % of diseased pigs. CRP-serum values of the first weaner series with an acute APP-outbreak differed extremely between groups and dates, particularly between first and follow up dates. Consecutive studies should clarify, if high values, as observed in our study and in contrast to others, are associated with a powerful immunity resp. with an efficient metaphylaxis (Tulathromycingroup), and if low values indicate the onset of the incubation of an infectious disease (Amoxicillin-group). In the first series of weaned pigs daily weight gains were significantly higher in the Tulathromycin-treated group (p< 0, 05) than in the APP-diseased Amoxicillin-group (0, 433 kg vs. 0, 388 kg) but not in the control group. In the second series of weaners and in fattening pigs groups did not differ in the growing performance. Due to the APP-infection in the first series of weaners, the rate of unsaleable pigs at delivery was significantly higher (p< 0, 001) in the Amoxicillin-group (24, 9 %) as compared to the Tulathromycin-group (5, 9 %) and the untreated controls (10, 9 %). Costs for metaphylaxis and additional medications per pig over time (drugs and treatments by stock´s person), and daily costs per unsaleable pigs after delivery were in case of the APP-infection much lower with Tulathromycin than with Amoxicillin as a metaphylaxis. In the second series of weaners and in fattenting pigs, each without APP-infection, oral Amoxicillinresp. Tetracycline-metaphylaxis was less expensive in total than the Tulathromycinmetaphylaxis by single dose injection. This is mainly due to higher drug volumes and working expenditure for the i. m. application. Further studies under field conditions should prove if total costs of Tulathromycin-metaphylaxis in case of extremely exposed APP-fattening herds may adjust or even reverse these costs. The good health and growing performance of non treated controls which were housed commonly with the Tulathromycin treated pigs might be the result of the antimicrobial caused decrease in germ pressure and its consecutive lower risk of infection. With reservation of the specific herd situations in this field study we conclude that in extremely APP-exposed weaned piglets the parenteral metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin with a single i. m. injection might be more efficient and less expensive during the growing period than oral medication of Amoxicillin over 7 days...|$|R
40|$|At present, the {{clinical}} significance of existing physicochemical and biological evidence {{and especially the}} results we have obtained from our previous in vitro experiments have been analyzed, and {{we have come to}} the conclusion that hippuric acid (C 6 H 5 CONHCH 2 COOH) is a very active solvent of Calcium Oxalate (CaOX) in physiological solutions. Two types of experiments have been discussed: clinical laboratory analysis on the urine excretion of hippuric acid (HA) in patients with CaOX lithiasis and detailed measurements of the kinetics of the dissolution of CaOX calculi in artificial urine, containing various concentrations of HA. It turns out that the most probable value of the HA concentration in the control group is approximately ten times higher than the corresponding value in the group of the stone-formers. Our in vitro analytical measurements demonstrate even a possibility to dissolve CaOX stones in human urine, in which increased concentration of HA have been established. A conclusion can be that drowning out HA is a significant regulator of CaOX supersaturation and thus a regulation of CaOX stone formation in human urine. Discussions have arisen to use increased concentration of HA in urine both as a solubilizator of CaOX stones in the urinary tract and on the purpose of a prolonged <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E

Prevention {{and treatment of}} EHM during EHV- 1 outbreaks is critical, but no reliable and tested specific medication is available. Due to the thromboischemic nature of EHM and {{due to the fact}} that EHV- 1 entry in cells is blocked by heparin, it was hypothesized that this compound may be useful in reduction of EHM incidence and severity. Therefore, during an acute EHV- 1 outbreak with the neuropathogenic G 2254 /D 752 Pol variant, <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> with heparin to prevent EHM was initiated. Clinical signs were present in 61 horses (fever n = 55; EHM n = 8; abortion n = 6).

40|$|The term {{infection}} stones {{refers to}} calculi that occur following urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by urease-producing gram-negative organisms. They consist of magnesium ammonium phosphate, carbonate apatite and monoammonium urate. Alkaline urine is most favorable to their formation. Urinary tract obstruction, neurogenic bladder, voiding dysfunction, temporary or indwelling urinary catheters, distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} and medullary sponge kidney are considered the main risk factors for developing infection stones. Urinalysis and urine culture are essential for diagnosis. A typical finding on imaging is a moderately radiopaque, staghorn or branched stone. Curative treatment is possible only by eliminating all of the stone fragments and by eradicating UTI.

40|$|Of {{the three}} major {{postpartum}} uterine diseases affecting dairy cattle (metritis, endometritis, and pyometra), endometritis is the most detrimental due to its high prevalence, negative impact on fertility, and diagnostic difficulty. Clinical signs are subtle or completely absent, making endometritis challenging to detect. The dynamics of uterine inflammation and involution are vital to consider {{in the context of}} the number of days postpartum since timing directly impacts the sensitivity and specificity of endometritis diagnostics. Timely identification of endometritis is vital since the subsequent failure or delay in pregnancy decreases DIM (days in milk), limits recovery time between calving and mating season, and increases culling risk. Metricheck was developed in New Zealand as a diagnostic alternative to more arduous cytology based techniques to identify eligible cows for treatment, particularly with Metricure, an intrauterine cephapirin. Several studies have demonstrated Metricure’s pharmacological efficacy and ability to mitigate the delay in days open linked to the chronic inflammation of endometritis (Kasimanickam, 2005 b; Dohmen, 1995). These results are similar to those achieved with either prostaglandin analogues (Kasimanickam, 2005 b). However, differences in production systems, product availability, and drug regulations limit the translatability of Metricheck, Metricure, and prostaglandins between New Zealand’s grazed herds and the United States’ confinement systems. Finally, no matter the context of use, distribution of <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> for endometritis must be reconciled with the insensitivity of available diagnostics.

Aim {{of the present study}} was to test a substituted benzimidazole (BAY-AF 76184) and a heterocyclic substituted 1, 2, 4 -triazin (BAY-AB 24992), both drugs with known anti-protozoal activity, for their potential ability to interfere with Cryptosporidium parvum development in vitro. Development of C. parvum in HCT- 8 cells treated with these compounds was compared to negative controls and parasites treated with paromomycin or halofuginone using real-time PCR targeting the 18 S rDNAs of parasites and host cells as template. Potential cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of drugs were analysed using a lactate dehydrogenase and a WST- 1 assay, respectively. BAY-AF 76184 and paromomycin dose-dependently inhibited development of C. parvum with EC 50 values of 2. 37 μM and 69. 5 μM, respectively. Although high concentrations of halofuginone and BAY-AB 24992 also significantly inhibited parasite development, effects of lower concentrations were very heterogeneous preventing calculation of EC 50 values.

The piglets of three groups were challenged intratracheally with H. parasuis serovar 5. As a result, four pigs in each challenged group died or had to be euthanised within 10 days post challenge. The remaining 15 pigs of these challenged groups survived until termination of the experiment (days 14 – 15). All pigs were necropsied and collective swabs of serosal surfaces were tested by bacterial culture and PCR. Samples of tarsal synovial fluid and joint capsule, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain swabs were tested by PCR. A total of 22 out of the 27 challenged animals had macroscopically detectable polyserositis and all of them tested positive in the collective swab samples. Haemophilus parasuis was more frequently detected in pigs that died within the first 10 days compared to those surviving until days 14 – 15 (P < 0. 001), and those that succumbed within 10 days showed higher positivity rates in the brain and CSF.

A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old {{at the start of}} study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study. During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥ 2) was similar (0. 7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly {{towards the end of the}} study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p= 0. 01) higher (+ 0. 057 kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4. 4 kg higher than the toltrazuril group.

The proportion of animals with one or more tetracycline resistant E. coli isolates was not different between the control, <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> and prophylactic treatment groups preslaughter; however, there were significantly more resistant animals in all groups preslaughter than at arrival. There were also no associations found between the total volume of parenteral antimicrobials used for disease treatment in individual animals and {{antimicrobial resistance}} in the cohort study. In addition, no strong associations were found between pen-level prevalence of antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial use or other variables. There {{was no significant difference between}} the proportion of isolates per pen resistant to tetracycline, one or more, two or more antimicrobials, or three or more antimicrobials when using 20, 15, 10 or 5 isolates from composite pen-level fecal samples. Variance for isolates resistant to three or more antimicrobials was partitioned as 12. 7 % at the feedyard-level and 28. 7 % at the pen-level. The use of diagnostic laboratory data for AMR surveillance was also discussed, and alternatives to antimicrobial treatment in the feedlot were also investigated. Overall a significant contribution to our understanding of antimicrobial resistance in feedlot cattle was achieved...|$|E

ReinhardtThree {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine nutritional and management strategies for different segments of the beef industry. The first experiment {{examined the effects of}} feeding traditional step-up diets (STEP) vs. limit-feeding (LIMIT) the finishing diet to adapt cattle to high-concentrate diets. When all cattle reached ad libitum intake of the finishing diet there was a trend (P = 0. 09) for DMI to be different between treatments. During week 1, STEP cattle had higher total VFA concentrations (P = 0. 02), while LIMIT cattle had higher valerate absorption (P = 0. 02) and disappearance (P = 0. 08). During week 4, LIMIT cattle had higher total VFA concentrations (P = 0. 03) and lower valerate disappearance and absorption (P = 0. 05) than STEP cattle. These results indicate that limit-feeding the finishing diet may inhibit nutrient absorption from the rumen or this method may cause increased production of valerate by lactate utilizing bacteria due to a more acidotic rumen environment. The second experiment examined the effects of feeding 5 % (DM basis) dried, full-fat corn germ (GERM) on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of naturally raised yearling steers and heifers. Carcass-adjusted ADG was higher for GERM cattle (P = 0. 04). There were no other differences in performance or carcass characteristics. Total incidence of liver abscesses and the incidence of severe liver abscesses were decreased by 12 and 8. 2 % (P = 0. 01 and 0. 02, respectively) when GERM was added to the diet. Corn germ can be added to finishing diets at 5 % without affecting performance and carcass characteristics. Producers raising natural cattle may also be able to benefit from the reduced incidence of liver abscesses. The third experiment examined concurrent <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> of high-risk calves with tulathromycin and chlortetracycline. Calves were placed on 1 of 3 treatments: 1) no top-dress pellets; 2) diet top-dressed with pellets containing chlortetracycline; or 3) diet top-dressed with pellets containing no chlortetracycline. There were no differences in the performance or health of these calves (P > 0. 25). There are no additive benefits of concurrent metaphylaxis using both tulathromycin and chlortetracycline. This information could assist producers when designing receiving health protocols for high-risk calves...|$|E
40|$|On {{the morning}} of November 3, 2010, a mixed breed stocker calf at 57 days on feed, housed in a pen of 300, at a 30, 000 head Southern Alberta feedlot, was {{observed}} to be depressed, gaunt, and reluctant to move. The heifer calf was segregated from pen mates and brought to an onsite hospital facility for further evaluation. Examination of treatment history revealed a previous episode of undifferentiated fever at 35 days on feed. Physical examination resulted in a problem list consisting of dehydration, depression, dyspnea, fever, inappetance, and nasal discharge. Subjective evaluation resulted in classification of the calf as being "sick. " However, no clinical signs {{could be attributed to}} any organ system other than the respiratory tract, resulting in a presumptive diagnosis of undifferentiated fever (UF). Upon arrival at the feedlot, the heifer had been assessed to be at high risk of developing undifferentiated fever, due to exposure to risk factors including: purchase at an auction market, comingling with animals from multiple sources, and being of a young age. <b>Metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> with tilmicosin (Micotil) was performed. In keeping with the feedlot's health management protocols, initial treatment for undifferentiated fever, at 35 days on feed, consisted of subcutaneous injection with tulathromycin (Draxxin). The undifferentiated fever relapse was treated with enrofloxacin (Baytril). Undifferentiated fever, also commonly referred to as bovine respiratory disease or shipping fever, is the most economically important disease affecting feedlot animals in North America (Booker et al, 1998). Bovine respiratory disease accounts for 70 - 80 % of morbidity and 40 - 50 % of mortality in feedlot animals. Major costs associated with the disease are attributed to preventative measures, treatment, and death loss (Jim et al, 1993). UF is a multifactorial disease, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial infectious agents in conjunction with a suppressed immune system, due to environmental and physiologic factors (Snowder et al, 2006). The major viral pathogens include bovine herpesvirus- 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza type 3, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Bacterial pathogen implicated in bovine respiratory disease are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis (Griffin et al, 2010). Control efforts have focused on reducing stress to the animals as they transition to the feedlot, as well as medical intervention, including vaccination and antibiotic usage (Booker et al, 1998) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{incoming}} feedlot cattle {{is a common}} preventative action against bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Cattle are dosed based on estimated or actual lot average weights, rather than on an individual basis, to reduce initial processing time. There has been limited research conducted {{on the effects of}} accurate weight- based dosing in feedlot cattle. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the economic effects of precision weight- based dosing of cattle as compared to dosing the lot average or lot averages plus 50 lb and minus 50 lb. An economic model was created and stochastic simulations performed to evaluate potential outcomes of different dosing scenarios. Economic analyses of the effects of precision weight-based dosing were conducted using SIMETAR? to determine the stochastic dominance and economic effects of different dosing regimens. Data were obtained from a commercial feedlot for different lots of cattle where individual animal weights were available; for this analysis the minimum lot size was 30 animals, and the maximum lot size was 126 animals. Within lots, individual weight deviations were calculated from the lot mean, the lot mean was rounded up to the nearest 50 lb increment or down to the nearest 50 lb increment to represent mild overestimation and mild underestimation, respectively. Tulathromycin (Draxxin?, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY), an antimicrobial commonly prescribed for treatment of bovine respiratory disease, was used to illustrate the impacts of uniform dosing versus exact dosing per body weight. Based on the dilution space method used to evaluate time of drug effectiveness, it was estimated that Draxxin? administered at the recommended dosage to cattle weighing between 500 and 1000 lb should be provided with 191 hours (7. 96 days) of protection from pneumonia-causing bacteria. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of Draxxin?, an animal that is administered half the recommended dose is only protected from pneumonia-causing bacteria for 8 hours, which is 4. 2 percent of the coverage time of the proper dose. This limits the effectiveness of the prescribed treatment to fully administer therapeutic treatment. In all cases, the correct weight-based dosing strategy cost less than any other dosing technique. Overall, dosing all cattle at the lot average weight costs $ 6. 04 per animal more than dosing at the exact, correct dose. Dosing all animals at the lot average weight plus 50 lb costs $ 6. 24 per animal more; dosing all animals at lot average minus 50 lb costs $ 4. 01 per animal more. The use of individual animal weights to determine per head dosing of Draxxin? is more cost effective than using lot averages. This concept would appear to extend to all weight-based pharmaceutical products in general, and should be considered a necessary management strategy...|$|E
40|$|Cattle {{classified}} as having low residual feed intake (RFI) phenotypes {{are those that}} consume less feed than expected based on body weight and growth performance. Mechanisms contributing to the variation in RFI are not fully understood. Previous {{studies have shown that}} cattle of divergent RFI phenotypes have different levels of energy expenditures, which are associated with heat increment, basal metabolism, thermoregulation responses, and physical activity. The objectives of this experiment were to characterize residual feed intake (RFI) in growing heifers and to determine if variation in whole-animal energy expenditure contributes to differences in RFI. Brangus heifers (n = 120) were individually fed a roughage-based diet (1. 93 Mcal ME/kg DM) diet twice daily and feed refusals measured weekly. Heifers were weighed once weekly for 70 d and RFI calculated as the difference between actual and expected DMI from linear regression of DMI on ADG and mid-test BW 0. 75. Immediately following the 70 d study, oxygen pulse rate (mL O 2 /heart beat) and 48 -h heart rates were measured on 8 high and 8 low RFI heifers to estimate energy expenditure. Daily heart rates and oxygen pulse rates were higher (P < 0. 05) in heifers with high RFI compared to those with low RFI. As a result, energy expenditure (kcal/BW 0. 75) was estimated to be 17. 4 percent greater (P < 0. 05) in high-RFI heifers then low-RFI heifers. Mortality and morbidity losses caused by bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continue to negatively impact the net revenues of the beef cattle industry. Stress can predispose calves arriving at feedlots to BRD by impairing their immune system with calves having more excitable temperaments possibly having a greater risk. The objectives of the second {{study was to examine the}} effects of <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> and temperament on performance, feed intake, feed efficiency, and feeding behavior traits in steers. Santa Gertrudis steers (n = 119) were weighed and randomly to control (CON; no antimicrobial treatment) or metaphylactic (MET; 1. 5 mL/ 45 kg BW of ceftiofur crystalline free acid) treatments. Steers were weighed at 14 -d intervals and individual intakes and feeding behavior traits measured using a GrowSafe sytems while fed a roughage-based diet (2. 21 Mcal ME/kg DM). Objective (relative exit velocity; REV) and subjective (chute score; CS) measurements of temperament were measured on arrival and on day 28 of the study. Steers with higher REV weighed less, grew slower, consumed less feed, spent less time consuming feeding, had more feeding bouts per meal, had less backfat, smaller longissimus muscle area, and higher cortisol levels. Steers treated with MET had higher ADG than those receiving CON. Cattle with higher REV that received MET had less of a decrease in ADG, DMI, time spend consuming feed, and less of an increase in feeding bouts compared to high REV steers receiving CON. Results from this study suggest that process-control strategies, which quantify and manage inter-animal variation in calf temperament may facilitate more judicious use of antimicrobial products and provide more consistent and predictable responses to metaphylactic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Eimeria – {{infections are}} {{protozoan}} parasitoses that occur worldwide among many domestic and farm animals, thus also among Old World Camels (OWC). The morphology, the endogenous and exogenous development of Eimeriae that are specific for camels {{as well as}} the alterations that can be detected histopathologically in such an infection are not comprehensively investigated and the majority of publications on this topic is more than 20 years old. Furthermore, there are no studies on factors associated with Coccidiosis (Eimeriosis) which is the clinically relevant form of an Eimeria infection. At present, the anticoccidial drug toltrazuril (Baycox®) is being used but is not registered for OWC. In addition there is largely a lack of understanding for the pharmacocinetic, tolerance and effectiveness in this genus. It was the goal of this work to collect new information about all of the above questions. Dromedaries were experimentally infected with E. cameli using different experimental set-ups, such as age, type of housing, infectious dose and medication. The course of the infection was investigated. To describe the endogenous development of E. cameli daily faeces samples were collected and examined for oocysts using a quantitative test [sedimentation]. Trials on the tenacity and observation of sporulation served to collect data on the exogenous development of the parasite. Furthermore, studies on the morphology of sporulated oocysts of this species were conducted. Histopathological examinations on 1, 192 intestine sections of 221 OWC were done to describe pathological alterations {{as well as the}} location of the developmental stages in the gastrointestinal tract. Together with microbiological data this information was used to conduct a statistical analysis on potential risk factors for clinically relevant coccidiosis. In addition a possible association with other endoparasites was tested. Finally, pro- and <b>metaphylactic</b> <b>treatment</b> with toltrazuril (Baycox®) were conducted on experimentally infected dromedaries. This work deals with the three species E. cameli, E. dromedarii and E. rajasthani in OWC in Dubai. For E. cameli a prepatent period of 16 - 40 days could be determined by experimental infection as well as a patent period of 12 - 48 days. The shedding curves showed mostly a bimodal distribution which is compatible with an undulating excretion of oocysts. This could be due to two asexual proliferation phases in E. cameli that are staggered in time. It was not possible to identify a clear circadian dynamic in the oocyst excretion. After experimental infection between 20 x 106 and 182 x 106 oocysts were shed. Among all animals the one with the lowest infectious dose and the youngest age shed most occysts. None of the different infectious doses led to a clinically apparent illness compatible with coccidiosis. Repeated blood samples showed that neutrophile granulocytes can be elevated during the prepatent period as a possible consequence of an Eimeria – infection. At an ambient temperature of 22 - 24 °C E. cameli sporulated within 8 - 20 days. E. cameli is very robust towards high temperatures and low relative humidity. Prevalence data from routine faeces samples in the emirate of Dubai were analysed for a period of 4 years, between 2003 – 2006. There was no significant variation over the years. In addition, prevalence from month to month were rather constant with a monthly average of 16. 3 %. The morphological studies were able to describe the fragile and transparent outer veil of E. cameli which was detected for the first time by YAGOUB (1989). The endogenous developmental stages can be found principally in the Lamina propria mucosae of the epithelium of the small intestine. The highest number of parasites {{can be found in the}} crypts of jejunum and ileum. Compared with an infection with E. cameli or small Eimeriae alone a mixed infection with Eimeria species (E. cameli + small Eimeriae) was statistically significantly associated with coccidiosis, the clinically relevant course of an Eimeria infection. It is possible that this risk is elevated further with a concurrent Cl. perfringens infection with irreversible damage in vital organs leading to death. Medication experiments with toltrazuril (Baycox®) showed that this anticoccidial drug (when given once oral p. i. on different days) was not able to interrupt the life cycle and a patent infection of Eimeriae. Giving the drug three times oral with a dose of each 20 mg/kg body weight with intervals of 5 to 6 days no side effects were observed supporting the notion of good tolerability. The rapid increase of the serum level in the first three days demonstrates its rapid absorption. The decline of the curve after reaching the peak supports the idea that toltrazuril is metabolized and its metabolites are excreted. Literature studies and the own investigations have shown that Eimeria infections in dromedaries are frequent. However, most infections are mono-infections with just one species which, according to my findings, lead in the most of the cases just to a subclinical course of infection. On the other hand, in dromedaries coccidioses can lead to severe and fatal illness. In front of the background of an increasing concentration of animals in camel farms (with an increased risk for infection due to coprophagia) this illness could gain far greater importance in the near future...|$|E
