5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the <b>metathorax.</b> Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and <b>metathorax.</b> The mesothorax and <b>metathorax</b> have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, <b>metathorax</b> and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the <b>metathorax.</b> In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the <b>metathorax.</b> The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the <b>metathorax,</b> which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the <b>metathorax</b> is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the <b>metathorax</b> is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the <b>metathorax.</b> A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the <b>metathorax.</b> Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the <b>metathorax,</b> the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a <b>metathorax.</b> In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the <b>metathorax.</b> The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the <b>metathorax</b> has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and femur are fused.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the <b>metathorax,</b> {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and <b>metathorax,</b> which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the <b>metathorax</b> segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
25|$|The insect thorax {{has three}} segments: the prothorax, mesothorax, and <b>metathorax.</b> The {{anterior}} segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax; its major features are the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax; its major features are the second pair of legs and the anterior wings, if any. The third, the posterior, thoracic segment, abutting the abdomen, is the <b>metathorax,</b> which bears the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron), and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the <b>metathorax</b> is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, {{there is also the}} mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum.|$|E
25|$|The ventral view or sternum {{follows the}} same convention, with the {{prosternum}} under the prothorax, the mesosternum under the mesothorax and the metasternum under the <b>metathorax.</b> The notum, pleura, and sternum of each segment {{have a variety}} of different sclerites and sutures, varying greatly from order to order, and they will not be discussed in detail in this section.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{mesothorax}} and <b>metathorax</b> {{hold the}} wings, {{they have a}} combined name called the pterothorax (pteron = wing). The forewing, which goes by different names in different orders (e.g., the tegmina in Orthoptera and elytra in Coleoptera), arises between the mesonotum and the mesopleura, and the hindwing articulates between the metanotum and metapleura. The legs arise from the mesopleura and metapleura. The mesothorax and <b>metathorax</b> each have a pleural suture (mesopleural and metapleural sutures) that runs from the wing base to the coxa of the leg. The sclerite anterior to the pleural suture is called the episternum (serially, the mesepisternum and metepisternum). The sclerite posterior to the suture is called the epimiron (serially, the mesepimiron and metepimiron). Spiracles, the external organs of the respiratory system, are found on the pterothorax, usually one between the pro- and mesopleoron, {{as well as one}} between the meso- and metapleuron.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} {{portion of}} the fly's <b>metathorax,</b> or scutellum, has a pair of stout processes, and often the laterotergite (one {{of a number of}} lateral flanges) of the postnotum (a small dorsal sclerite on the insect thorax posterior to the notum) has a dome-like swelling or spine-like process. The anterior femora of the legs are stout, with ventral spines. Adult males have lost tergites seven and eight, and the seventh sternite forms a complete ventral band.|$|E
25|$|The {{prothorax}} on this conehead is shielded {{by a large}} pronotum {{that extends}} from over the cervix (neck) on the anterior side to cover the mesothorax {{and most of the}} <b>metathorax</b> on the posterior side, as well as covering the pleura on the prothorax. The pronotum of the prothorax may be simple in structure and small in comparison with the other nota, but in beetles, mantids, many bugs, and some Orthoptera, the pronotum is expanded, and in cockroaches, it forms a shield that covers part of the head and mesothorax.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} subfamily is a tymbal organ on the <b>metathorax.</b> This organ has membranes which are vibrated to produce ultrasonic sounds. They also have thoracic tympanal organs for hearing, a trait which has a fairly broad distribution in the Lepidoptera, but the location and structure is distinctive to the subfamily. Other distinctive traits are particular setae ('hairs') on the larvae, wing venation, {{and a pair of}} glands near the ovipositor. The sounds are used in mating and for defense against predators. Another good distinguishing character of the subfamily is presence of anal glands in females.|$|E
25|$|The species Lucilia cuprina, {{formerly}} named Phaenicia cuprina, is {{more commonly}} known as the Australian sheep blowfly. It belongs to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics allow for the separation. Lucilia cuprina {{is a member of the}} order Diptera, has a pair of short but very strong membranous wings and a pair of hindwings reduced and modified to clublike balancers known as halteres. This adaptation distinguishes the true flies (Diptera) from the other orders with “fly” in their name, and serves as a sensory aid that acts as tiny gyroscopes or inertial navigation system. The mesothorax is much enlarged while the prothorax and <b>metathorax</b> are reduced. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly or a little larger, and though considered to be nuisances indoors are essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter. Most are metallic blue or green, and often have black gena, mostly white calypteres and orange yellow anterior thoracic spiracles.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments [...] the hindmost two, the mesothorax and <b>metathorax,</b> being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the mesothorax, and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the <b>metathorax.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{two pairs}} of wings are found on the middle and third segment, or {{mesothorax}} and <b>metathorax</b> respectively. In the more recent genera, {{the wings of the}} second segment are much more pronounced, however some more primitive forms have similarly sized wings of both segments. The wings are covered in scales arranged like shingles, forming the extraordinary variety seen in color. The mesothorax is evolved to have more powerful muscles to propel moth or butterfly through the air, with the wing of said segment having a stronger vein structure. The largest superfamily, Noctuidae, has the wings modified to act as Tympanal or hearing organs Modifications in the wing's venation include: ...|$|E
500|$|Insect {{wings are}} adult outgrowths of the insect {{exoskeleton}} that enable insects to fly. They are {{found on the}} second and third thoracic segments (the mesothorax and <b>metathorax),</b> and the two pairs are {{often referred to as the}} forewings and hindwings, respectively, though a few insects lack hindwings, even rudiments. [...] The wings are strengthened by a number of longitudinal veins, which often have cross-connections that form closed [...] "cells" [...] in the membrane (extreme examples include the dragonflies and lacewings). The patterns resulting from the fusion and cross-connection of the wing veins are often diagnostic for different evolutionary lineages and can be used for identification to the family or even genus level in many orders of insects.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments as in all insects. The prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc which has two transverse ridges. The mesothorax and <b>metathorax</b> are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed {{with a pair of}} claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an [...] "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.|$|E
500|$|S. freyi ants are small, {{measuring}} [...] The mandibles are wasp-like, its 12-segmented antennae are {{far apart}} {{from each other}} and the second funicular segment is longer than all the other segments. This is unusual for ants, but such case occurs in Nothomyrmecia macrops. The scapes are very short at [...] The compound eyes are very long and convex, situated on the middle side of the head. The clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the [...] "face" [...] of an arthropod or insect) is broad and convex and the ocelli (photoreceptors) are well developed. The mesosoma is slender and closely resembles those of Methocha malayana, measuring [...] The mesonotum is also long and slender with a distinct convexed scutum and scutellum, but these two features are separated from each other by an axillary region. Spiracles are present on the <b>metathorax,</b> but they are situated just below the scutellum. The petiole has a raised node and separated from the propodeum and the gaster. The gaster measures , and an acute protruding stinger, measuring [...] is present. The legs are long and slender with two tibial spurs present at each tibia, and the tarsal claws have a median tooth. The two worker specimens have little morphological differences, but they range in size. The head and segments of the antenna tend to be smaller in the holotype specimen while in the paratype they are slightly larger. The pubescence is short but scattered throughout the body, measuring [...] The colour of the specimens appears to be light-brown. The metapleural gland exhibits a notably wide and oval-shaped orifice, (openings into the body). The separation between the orifice and the posterior portion of the propodeum is twice the diameter than the orifice itself. The cuticle situated in the anterior portion (referring to what is in front) of the orifice is thinner in contrast to the cuticle surrounding the mesosoma, where it is notably transparent. An oddly shaped chamber can be seen beneath the cuticle, but this is most likely the atrium (chamber with a hardened, thickened wall). The gland itself is covered in a whitish mass and is located in the [...] region (meaning in front and toward the back) of the subcuticular chamber. The gland is said to be shrunken from its original size.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the <b>metathorax.</b> Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and <b>metathorax.</b> The mesothorax and <b>metathorax</b> have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
50|$|The <b>metathorax</b> is the {{posterior}} {{of the three}} segments in the thorax of an insect, and bears the third pair of legs. Its principal sclerites (exoskeletal plates) are the metanotum (dorsal), the metasternum (ventral), and the metapleuron (lateral) on each side. The <b>metathorax</b> is the segment that bears the hindwings in most winged insects, though sometimes these may be reduced or modified, as in Diptera, {{in which they are}} reduced to form halteres, or flightless beetles (Coleoptera), in which they may be completely absent even though forewings are still present. All adult insects possess legs on the <b>metathorax.</b> In most groups of insects, the metanotum is reduced relative to the mesonotum. In the suborder Apocrita of the Hymenoptera, the first abdominal segment is fused to the <b>metathorax,</b> and is then called the propodeum.|$|E
5000|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments [...] - [...] the hindmost two, the mesothorax and <b>metathorax,</b> being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the mesothorax, and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the <b>metathorax.</b>|$|E
50|$|In dragonflies and damselflies the {{mesothorax}} and <b>metathorax</b> are fused {{together to}} form the synthorax.|$|E
50|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, <b>metathorax</b> and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion - the legs and wings - are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the <b>metathorax.</b> In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
50|$|While {{the adults}} are fairly nondescript, Chrysauginae larvae {{can usually be}} {{recognized}} unequivocally by the sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the <b>metathorax.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} {{primitive}} Lepidoptera, {{the frequency of}} the wing beat is constant while the moth is in flight. When at rest, the wings are laid back on the abdomen and thorax. In this position, the wings are hooked to the <b>metathorax</b> with very fine, hook-like hairs, present on both the undersides of the wings and the <b>metathorax,</b> which interlock in a [...] "Velcro" [...] way. This wing-locking mechanism is referred to as [...] "Haftfeld" [...] (sometimes not capitalised) and is characteristic of the family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{level of}} specialization—anatomical, {{functional}} and morphological—is such {{that in general}} these insects fly, often exceptionally, well, with particular reference to agility. All Diptera are equipped with only one pair of functional wings, which are on the mesothorax (front). The wings on the <b>metathorax</b> are transformed into the halteres or rocker arms. From this characteristic comes {{the name of the}} order, from the Greek dipteros, which means [...] "two wings". In consequence of this morphological structure, the mesothorax represents the segment of greater development and complexity, while the prothorax and <b>metathorax</b> are considerably reduced.|$|E
5000|$|In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax {{is one of}} {{the three}} main {{divisions}} (or tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the area where the wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the thorax itself is composed of three segments; the prothorax, the mesothorax, and the <b>metathorax.</b> In extant insects, the prothorax never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the <b>metathorax,</b> though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments. In the Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal segment is fused to the <b>metathorax,</b> where it forms a structure known as the propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the mesosoma to distinguish it from the [...] "thorax" [...] of other insects.|$|E
50|$|No tufts behind collar as in Euplexia, {{but only}} tufts present on <b>metathorax.</b> Scales much smoother. Abdominal tufts slight. Fore tibial tufts are very developed. Cilia {{slightly}} crenulated. Antennae almost simple.|$|E
50|$|The American {{cockroach}} shows {{a characteristic}} insect morphology with its body bearing divisions as head, trunk, and abdomen. The trunk, or thorax, is divisible in prothorax, mesothorax and <b>metathorax.</b> Each thoracic segment {{gives rise to}} a pair of walking appendages (known as legs). The organism bears two wings. The forewings, known as tegmina arises from mesothorax and is dark and opaque. The hind wings arise from <b>metathorax</b> and are used in flight, though they rarely do. The abdomen is divisible into ten segments each of which is surrounded by chitinous exoskeleton plates called sclerites, including dorsal tergites, ventral sternites and lateral pleurites.|$|E
50|$|It {{is formed}} by the prothorax, {{mesothorax}} and <b>metathorax</b> and comprises the scutellum; the cervix, a membrane that separates the head from the thorax; and the pleuron, a lateral sclerite of the thorax.|$|E
