40|$|The {{interactions}} of the electrostatic antenna {{with the space}} environment in both low Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit are investigated. It is concluded that the electrostatically controlled membrane mirror is a viable concept for space applications. However, great {{care must be taken}} to enclose the high voltage electrodes in a Faraday cage structure to separate the high voltage region from the ambient plasma. For this reason, <b>metallized</b> <b>cloth</b> is not acceptable as a membrane material. Conventional spacecraft charging at geosynchronous orbit should not be a problem provided ancillary structures (such as booms) are given nonnegligible conductivity and adequate grounding. Power loss due to plasma electrons entering the high field region is a potentially serious problem. In low earth orbit any opening whatever in the Faraday cage is likely to produce an unacceptable power drain...|$|E
