5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E

5|$|The {{conscription}} of German <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the war created a manpower shortage in German factories important for the war effort.

5|$|Alongside his {{television}} and film work, Castellaneta {{has appeared in}} a number of theatrical productions. In 1992, he starred in Deb & Dan's Show alongside his wife. In 1995, Castellaneta started writing Where Did Vincent van Gogh?, a one man play in which he portrays a dozen different characters, including artist Vincent van Gogh.

5|$|At 01:30 on 7 June, the 9th Parachute Battalion, {{with only}} around ninety <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, marched through the unoccupied Bréville. Upon {{arrival at the}} 3rd Parachute Brigade's position, the {{parachute}} battalion was ordered to dig in at {{the northern end of}} the brigade line. They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across a clearing in the woods, to a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts. A shortage in their numbers left a large gap between the 9th Parachute Battalion and No. 6 Commando, the most southern unit in the commando defensive position, to their north.|$|E

Marietta took the name Suor Ludovica and became a respected member of the convent in a position of some responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. <b>Men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as at many front-line fort.|$|E

When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E

5|$|Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied {{in school}} and, {{at the age}} of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a {{derelict}} house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him.

5|$|Rome's {{military}} confederation {{with the}} other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army {{was provided by the}} Socii, such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry.

5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of the United States. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E

When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
5|$|The <b>men</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions.

When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920.|$|E
