5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Endeavour docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked {{to make room for}} the space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick. The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could tell that Scotland had scored.|$|E

5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} not shot in Pimlico, but about a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> in Lambeth. A set {{was built on}} a large Second World War bombsite {{just south of the}} Lambeth Road at the {{junction}} of Hercules Road. At the conclusion of filming, the site had to be returned to the same bomb-damaged state as before, to enable the locals to claim war damage compensation. The site has since been built on, and now features 1960s municipal flats.|$|E
5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} half a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising {{to a variety of}} animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|In many early western {{films and}} literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having {{conflicts}} and battles against gunfighters and white settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), {{an estimate of}} 19,000 white men, {{women and children were}} killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during the American Indian Wars. Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> with his Sharps rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.|$|E
5|$|Shankill Parish Church {{belongs to}} the Anglican Church of Ireland. The {{original}} church was established at Oxford Island {{on the shore of}} Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> on the 'Green of Lurgan', now known as Church Place, where it stands to this day. It {{is believed to be the}} largest parish church in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less than a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and {{put them out of}} business. Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, for a run in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West Ham and Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a <b>mile</b> <b>away,</b> including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
5|$|To stop this, the Spartan {{commander}} ordered {{some of his}} men {{to charge}} the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, and then, when the Spartans turned {{to return to the}} regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, about a half <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke and ran for the boats, pursued by the peltasts all the way. All in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed.|$|E
