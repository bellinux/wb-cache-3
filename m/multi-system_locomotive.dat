25|$|Once Bombardier {{completed}} the first TRAXX F140MS, a single-voltage version for DC overhead wires could be produced cost effectively by leaving away the AC equipment of a <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and Bombardier began seeking a launch customer in 2004. In 2005, Angel Trains (today Alpha Trains) placed {{an order for}} 10 DC electric locomotives with Bombardier. The first machine, designated E483 001, was produced in August 2006 at Bombardier's plant in Kassel.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{is useful}} for {{providing}} a single journey over multiple electrification systems without interruption, either from requiring passengers to change trains or from changing locomotives. Such conditions can occur where a train crosses national boundaries and each country has implemented a different electrification system.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Multi-system</b> <b>locomotive,</b> {{also known}} as a multi-system {{electric}} locomotive, multi-system electric multiple unit, or multi-system train, is an electric locomotive which can operate using more than one railway electrification system. Multi-system trains provide continuous journeys over routes which are electrified using more than one system.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017 {{production}} of the <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> is still ongoing.|$|R
50|$|SBB Cargo International will, initially, lease 109 {{locomotives}} from SBB Cargo; 59 will be <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> for cross-border use.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, freight {{operations}} were {{largely in the}} hands of <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> such as the German class 185 (Bombardier TRAXX) and the French BB 37000.|$|R

50|$|PKP Cargo owns {{more than}} 2,300 {{locomotives}} and uses more than 1,300 of them. Some of PKP Cargo’s locomotives have entered into service abroad. The company runs independent operations, {{for instance in}} Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands, using Siemens EuroSprinter <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Electric locomotives: ET22 and ET41 and diesel locomotives: ST44, ST45 and SM42 have also entered into service in the Czech and Slovak railway networks. All PKP Cargo locomotives currently in use, {{with the exception of}} <b>multi-system</b> Siemens <b>locomotives,</b> are equipped with GPS devices.|$|R
50|$|Serial {{production}} never happened. Although Zagreb Workshop showed, that {{it could}} do the job, the real full re-electrification of Zagreb-Rijeka line has not happened yet. Croatian Railways do today rent <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> in order to drive the whole line non-stop. A power conversion on the total line is slated to be finished soon.|$|R
50|$|Another seven through tracks, {{which are}} not {{equipped}} with platforms, are used for overtaking and exchange of locomotives. All single system electric locomotives must be changed here at the border, since Austria and Italy use different electrical networks (15kV AC at 16 2/3 Hz in Austria, 3000 V DC in Italy). However, the Südtirol Bahn now operate on <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> on their Bozen/Bolzano-Innsbruck through service.|$|R
2500|$|Post 2006 {{many more}} of these <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{produced}}, this time with some {{for use in the}} Benelux countries, as well as France and Poland, with further units being produced for Swiss/Italian traffic. In Poland, locomotives used by PKP Cargo have been designated as the EU43 class. Units hired from Alpha Trains cargo to SNCB (Belgium) have also received the class number SNCB Class 28 ...|$|R
50|$|The station {{forecourt}} and the passenger facilities {{at the station}} were remodelled from 1998 to 2003. The station building was renovated and a platform was removed. With the accession of Poland to the European Union and later to the Schengen Agreement, the station lost most of {{its role as a}} border station. For some trains, it is still a stop for changing locomotives. The trains of the Berlin-Warszawa-Express are now operated with <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> that can use both the German and the Polish electrical supply.|$|R
50|$|Newag Griffin is {{a series}} of four-axle {{electric}} and diesel locomotives produced by Newag in Gliwice from 2012. The locomotive is made for pulling passenger carriages and cargo. The first version, the E4MSU is a universal <b>multi-system</b> electric <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R

In 2005 the founder companies increased the capital of the company by €4 million to €5 million to enable the purchase of <b>multi-system</b> electric <b>locomotives.</b> Safety certificate for operations in Belgium was acquired (by the subsidiary Rail4chem Benelux BV) in January 2006, and for operations in France in February 2006, ...|$|R
25|$|In September 2003, Bombardier {{gave the}} Class 185 family a brand name, TRAXX, {{intended}} to allude {{to the terms}} 'traction', 'track' and 'attraction'. The acronym stands for Transnational Railway Applications with eXtreme fleXibility. The first letter of TRAXX type designations provides for differentiation according {{to the area of}} application, with F for freight and P for passenger. The original system also tentatively included H for heavy-haul and S for high-speed, but no actual vehicles were delivered under this designation. The number following the first letter indicates the top speed of the locomotive in kilometers per hour. The next two letters indicate the supply system, with AC for alternating current electric locomotives, DC for direct current electric <b>locomotives,</b> MS for <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> capable of operating both under AC and DC overhead wires, and DE was foreseen from the start for an eventual Diesel-electric version. An extra P letter at the end was to designate powerheads (traction heads), that is locomotives with one driving cabin for push-pull operation. An also optional number at the end designates different versions, later used for the designation of generations.|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of advanced circuit solutions and parameters of traction electric supply and electric rolling stock provides {{the organization and}} the introduction of high-speed movement of trains on the Railways of Ukraine. It is established that the force of the current system of electric traction with the constant voltage 3, 3 kV is appropriate to the stress increase in the traction network in the first stage up to 6 kV, and then to 2 kV due to the transition from the existing centralized system of power supply of the traction to the network distributed power. In the field of electric rolling stock all experts believe {{that it is necessary to}} create a universal <b>multi-system</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the basis of brushless electric traction motors, as a rule, asynchronous shorted ones. These subsystems of electric traction, traction electric supply and electric rolling stock are very complex and, in addition, non-linear, dynamic, and powerful ones and this determines the practical impossibility of their exact classical mathematical models construction. It is proposed to create the mathematical model for such subsystems, and thus for the entire system of electric traction by the methods of parametric or structural identificatio...|$|R
