In this paper the authors use for extrusion polyamide 6. 6 reinforced with 20 % glass fibers. This material offers very good mechanical, thermal and frictional proprieties. The improvement of these proprieties can be realized through the optimization of the extrusion process.

It was proved that the main influence upon the product’s quality have the temperatures from the <b>metering</b> <b>zone</b> and from the forming zone so the optimization of these is of maximum importance for the quality of the products.

The defects such as black spots and yellow surface appeared when the light guide plate was processed by domestic equipments. The main problem was caused by the plasticization unit. The Influencing factors of performance for polycarbonate (PC) special screw were discussed in this paper. The conveyance capacity of melt in the <b>metering</b> <b>zone</b> of injection screws with different flight width and channel depth was analyzed by POLYFLOW software. In order to obtain high surface hardness, corrosion resistance and smoothness of PC special screw, surface coating processing was the key point for injection molding light guide plate.

40|$|International audienceA {{study on}} the {{extrusion}} of Eudragit E 100 was carried out using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) as plasticizer and foaming agent. ScCO 2 modifies the rheological properties of the material in {{the barrel of the}} extruder and acts as a blowing agent during the relaxation when flowing through the die. For experiments, a single-screw extruder was modified to be able to inject scCO(2) within the extruded material. The aim is to determine a correlation between operating conditions and foam structure. The effect of three parameters was studied: the temperature in the die and in the <b>metering</b> <b>zone,</b> the screw speed, and the volumetric flow rate of CO 2. An increase in temperature enhances the expansion rate and the average pore diameter and appears to be the most significant parameter. The effect of CO 2 concentration is significant at small concentrations only: the higher the CO 2 concentration, the lower the pore density and the higher both the pore diameter and the expansion rate. The effect of the screw speed is tricky because a variation of this speed involves a decrease of CO 2 weight ratio. This study shows that the structure of the extrudates does not evolve with a coupling of screw speed increase and a subsequent CO 2 weight ratio decrease. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is necessary to have an exact control on process to producing high quality products with safe operation and optimum energy consumption. The granule size is depending on granulator motor speed.

30|$|First, {{methods for}} {{back-light}} compensation detection and operation, {{that are based}} on the (difference of) measured signals in various areas of the image, have intrinsic problems if the object of interest is miss-positioned, or if it leaves the area of interest. The consequence is the severe underexposure of the important foreground object. To detect the change of object position, areas of interest are often set several times larger than the size of the object. However, the average intensity level of the whole metering window can be so high {{and the size of the}} object of interest can be very small, that insufficient back-light compensation occurs and the object details still remain invisible. Second, the changed object position can also give problems to the video-level controller, due to a considerable change of the measured signal because of the large differences in weights of the <b>metering</b> <b>zones.</b> These problems can be solved by dynamic weighting schemes.|$|R

BACKGROUND During the winters of 1989 and 1990 the California Department of Pesticide Regulation monitored the aerial movement of three OPs used as dormant sprays in California orchards. This monitoring demonstrated that during the winter, OPs are regionally transported and deposited on non-target vegetation during fog and dry weather as a result of drift either during or after application. The results suggested that pesticides contained in fog may have come from applications made outside a 400 <b>meter</b> <b>zone</b> as well as from closer applications.

30|$|To {{cope with}} the HDR scene {{conditions}} {{in case of a}} stationary video camera, the user is often given the freedom to set the area weights and positions of several zones of interest. The idea is to set higher weights at areas where the interesting foreground objects are likely to appear, for instance, at moving glass doors of the building entrance. In cases when the darker foreground object is present in the zone of interest, it will dominate the measurement as the bright background will be mostly ignored and hence the image display will be optimized for the foreground. This explains why it is important to correctly set the <b>metering</b> <b>zones,</b> or otherwise, the object of interest will be underexposed and will vanish in shadows. We will now describe two general cases of selective weighting: (1) static weighting, when weights (and metering areas) are once selected and set by the user, and (2) dynamic weighting, when weights depend on the content of the metering areas. It will be shown that dynamic weighting, although more complex, provides better results than the static weighting.|$|R
