On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>case</b> to Minnesotans.

But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May, Marshal Pietro Badoglio led Italian {{troops into}} Addis Ababa, and Mussolini {{declared}} Ethiopia an Italian province. Victor Emanuel III was proclaimed {{as the new}} Emperor of Ethiopia. On the previous day, the Ethiopian exiles had left French Somaliland aboard the British cruiser HMS Enterprise. They were bound for Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine, where the Ethiopian royal family maintained a residence. The Imperial family disembarked at Haifa {{and then went on}} to Jerusalem. Once there, Haile Selassie and his retinue prepared to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>case</b> at Geneva. The choice of Jerusalem was highly symbolic, since the Solomonic Dynasty claimed descent from the House of David. Leaving the Holy Land, Haile Selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the British cruiser HMS Capetown for Gibraltar, where he stayed at the Rock Hotel. From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the government of the United Kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception.|$|E

[...] According to the Catholic Diocese of Arlington: ...signs that might indicate reasons to investigate for an annulment are: marriage that excluded {{at the time of the}} wedding the right to children, or to a permanent marriage, or to an exclusive commitment. In addition, there are youthful marriages; marriages of very short duration; marriages marked by serious emotional, physical, or substance abuse; deviant sexual practices; profound and consistent irresponsibility and lack of commitment; conditional consent to a marriage; fraud or deceit to elicit spousal consent; serious mental illness; or a previous bond of marriage. The determination of the ground should be made after extensive consultation with the parish priest or deacons, and based upon the proofs that are available.|$|E

60|$|These are {{sometimes}} so apparent that they command the charity of others; {{but there are}} also many families reduced to decay whose conditions are not so public, and yet their necessities as great.

Even if it is assumed that the arbitrator is, on average, as well informed as the two opposing parties, the adversarial procedure is shown to be strictly superior. This superiority stems from the ability within the adversarial procedure to allocate the burden of proof in an effective manner, and thereby extract the maximal informational content from apparently inconclusive contests. ...|$|R

Then Before getting into what is important about Caspar Creek, I would like to inject a few ideas that consumers of watershed research should keep in mind.

That is the first lesson to carry away from this discussion. The results of every watershed experiment are a unique combination o...|$|R
40|$|Should arbitrators {{adjudicate}} on {{the basis}} of their own investigations, or invite the interested parties to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>cases</b> and decide {{on the basis}} of the information so gathered? I call the former the inquisitorial procedure in arbitration and the latter the adversarial procedure. I conduct a welfare comparison of the two procedures by constructing a game-theoretic model of decision making by an arbitrator in the face of self-interested reporting strategies by the interested parties. Even if it is assumed that the arbitrator is, on average, as well informed as the two opposing parties, the adversarial procedure is strictly superior. The source of this superiority lies in a non-convexity in the adversarial procedure. There are increasing marginal returns to improvements in the information of an interested party. There are no analogous increasing returns to the arbitrator’s information under the inquisitorial procedure. advocates; Asymmetric Information; inquisitor; legal procedure; persuasion games; value of information...|$|R
