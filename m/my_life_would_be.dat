25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

[...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When I was a child, I felt that if only I could change myself, <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} Nancy and Ronald's {{relationship as}} intimate. As President and First Lady, the Reagans {{were reported to}} display their affection frequently, with one press secretary noting, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] Ronald often called Nancy [...] "Mommy"; she called him [...] "Ronnie". While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy wrote in her diary, [...] "Nothing can happen to my Ronnie. <b>My</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> over." [...] In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, [...] "whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When her husband was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease In 1998, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were {{very much in love}} and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy was known for the focused and attentive look, termed [...] "the Gaze", that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances.|$|E

500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although his {{journals}} clarify {{some aspects}} of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: [...] "Were I to die now the effect of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance {{and have a great}} effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by the Sunday Times on 23 July 1989, Allan recalled a significant episode when Terre'Blanche had drunkenly hammered on her flat door and eventually slept on the doorstep {{and that she had}} to step over him the next morning. Despite her objections, her editor, Myburgh, insisted on publishing answering machine messages allegedly by Terre'Blanche, accompanied by a denial by Allan of counter claims that he had made against her. Allan recounted conversations with her editor [...] "After the bomb he said, 'Right, we'll publish the tapes.' I said I didn't think that would be wise, as the security police had told me <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in danger. He said, 'We're going to blow them out of the water.'" [...] She had just emerged from a course of traction for her seized back, and was then rushed to hospital with a bleeding ulcer because of the stress. Allan fled to Britain permanently for security reasons in the same week that the transcripts were published. The tapes were the Sunday Times lead story published on 30 July 1989 with the front-page headline 'JANI: MY ET TAPES'.|$|E
