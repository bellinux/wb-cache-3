50|$|A tank is {{sectioned}} {{off into}} different compartments. A compartment may include a settling tank, sometimes called a sand trap, to allow sand and other solids in the drilling fluid to precipitate before it {{flows into the}} next compartment. Other compartments may have agitators on the top, which have long impellers below inserting into the tank and stirring the fluids to prevent its contents from precipitating. And <b>mud</b> <b>guns</b> are often equipped {{at the corners of}} the tanks' top, spraying high-pressed mud to prevent the drilling fluids {{in the corner of the}} compartment from precipitating, typically for the square tanks.|$|R

60|$|It was {{now nearly}} seven {{o'clock in the}} evening, and the Prussians were engaged at St. Lambert, Napoleon having {{detached}} Lobau's corps to arrest their progress. Their march had been a terrible one. They had to traverse country roads softened by the rain; the men were up to their ankles in <b>mud,</b> <b>guns</b> and carriages stuck fast, {{and it was not}} until after tremendous efforts that the leading squadron of their cavalry passed through the wood of Wavre and came in view of the battle that was raging. It was then past four o'clock, and another hour passed before any considerable number of infantry arrived. It was at this time Napoleon sent Lobau against them. He was able for a time to resist their advance; but as fresh troops came up from the rear the Prussians began to win their way forward, and Napoleon was obliged to send two more divisions of the Young Guard to check them.|$|R
