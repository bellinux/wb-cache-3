The <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> display different stages of cancer progression and are contrasted {{by the action of}} the immune system cells.

50|$|The {{recognition}} of mutation-induced antigens on tumors by T cells {{is only one}} aspect of a more general phenomenon which can rightly be named: T cell immunosurveillance of the integrity of the genome. Any somatic mutation has a probability of producing a new antigen that can be recognized by T cells. If the <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> divides significantly, the resulting clonal population may be eliminated by a T lymphocyte response.|$|E
50|$|Lutzner cells begin {{developing}} in bone marrow then {{travel to the}} thymus via the secretion of the hormone thymosin. The secretion allows them to differentiate and mature. Once the <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> is developed, it patiently waits in the thymus until an antigen presents itself. When a cutaneous lymphocyte antigen is expressed in the skin, the CD4+ Lutzner cell travels to the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin in order to bind to the antigen.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} area {{where one can}} talk of [...] "clones" [...] of cells is neoplasms. Many of the tumors derive from one (sufficiently) <b>mutated</b> <b>cell,</b> so they are technically a single clone of cells. However, during course of cell division, one of the cells can get mutated further and acquire new characteristics to diverge as a new clone. However, this view of cancer onset has been challenged {{in recent years and}} many tumors have been argued to have polyclonal origin, i.e. derived from two or more cells or clones, including malignant mesothelioma.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of steady}} state data as a {{starting}} point for functional and relational inferences in biology is commonplace. Most of what is known in biology in terms of the association of genes with particular functions or phenotypes, and in terms of the connections between genes that collaborate to produce particular functions or phenotypes, has been inferred from steady state data. One of the most productive fields of inference, biochemical genetics, has used massive mutational screens to establish associations between particular genes and particular metabolic processes producing subunits, such as synthesis of an amino acid or between particular genes and more complex processes, such as the replication of a genome. The strategy used in these projects has usually been to produce a large set of cells, each having approximately one mutation (randomly placed) in its genome and then allowing the <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> to grow under conditions that shelter the organism from the defect of the mutation. In metabolite studies, the mutants would be propagated on a rich media that supplies many different essential metabolites, therefore allowing cells harboring mutations inactivating the synthesis of these metabolites to grow. The defect is then revealed by transferring arrays of representatives of the pool of <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> to a minimal media and noting which cell types died. The mutants could then be further tested by transfer of a representative array of the <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> to media containing more and more highly specified sets of supplemental metabolites until one could specify that a particular mutant is associate...|$|R
50|$|The clonal {{evolution}} {{model was}} first proposed in 1976 by Peter Nowell. In this model, tumours arise {{from a single}} <b>mutated</b> <b>cell,</b> accumulating additional mutations as it progresses. These changes give rise to additional subpopulations, and each of these subpopulations {{has the ability to}} divide and mutate further. This heterogeneity may give rise to subclones that possess an evolutionary advantage over the others within the tumour environment, and these subclones may become dominant in the tumour over time. When proposed, this model allowed for the understanding of tumour growth, treatment failure, and tumour aggression that occurs during the natural process of tumour formation.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the most}} common type and diverse range of lymphoma. Normally, it occurs with a B cell {{becoming}} abnormal, but also occurs when a T cell becomes abnormal. The <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> then divides to create multiple cells. Lymphoma cells can be distributed all over the body and into various tissues. Lutzner cells are found in skin tissue, more specifically, the epidermis and dermis layers. An accumulation of Lutzner cells in the layers of the skin can cause cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous cell lymphoma is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. [...] Two forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with abnormal T-lymphocytes or Lutzner cells are Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome. These two diseases are very similar, but both present themselves in different ways.|$|E
5000|$|MIT professor, Ron Weiss, {{has worked}} {{extensively}} {{in this field}} and has been leading a team in incorporating the concepts of computer programming and engineering to biology. [...] "I decided to take what we understand in computing and apply that to programming biology. To me, that's really the essence of synthetic biology." [...] Weiss' team published a study that discusses how they combined computer circuit elements with BioBricks parts. The way this works is that the computer circuit is able to distinguish between a healthy and <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> by utilizing a set of five criteria. Any cells that satisfy these conditions are deleted, {{similar to the way}} code could eliminate certain functions in computer programming. The ability to target individual cells could make this an alternative to treatments that may have harmful effects on healthy cells, such as chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|It {{also has}} been {{proposed}} that activation of an autosomal dominant lethal mutation that survives by mosaicism may {{be the cause of}} the lesions. The <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> may survive in the due to proximity of normal cells.

40|$|Abstract. Poly(ADP-ribose) {{polymerase}} (PARP) inhibitors {{have been}} proven to represent superior clinical agents targeting DNA repair mechanisms in cancer therapy. We investigated PARP inhibitory effects of the natural and synthetic flavo-noids (quercetin, rutin, monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin) and tested the synthetic lethality in BRCA 2 <b>mutated</b> <b>cells.</b> In vitro ELISA assay suggested that the flavonoids have inhibitory effects on PARP activity, but glucosyl modi-fications reduced the inhibitory effect. Cytotoxicity tests of Chinese hamster cells defective in BRCA 2 gene (V-C 8) and its parental V 79 cells showed BRCA 2 -dependent synthetic lethality when treated with the flavonoids. BRCA 2 <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> were three times {{more sensitive to the}} flavonoids than the wild-type and gene complemented cells. Reduced toxicity was observed in a glucosyl modification-dependent manner.

5000|$|In metazoans, {{defense against}} {{disruption}} of the multicellular life style by such cheaters takes two major forms. First, a consistent feature of the multicellular life cycle is the interposition of a unicellular phase, even among organisms whose major mode of propagation may be via many-celled vegetative propagules. This unicellular phase usually {{takes the form of}} a sexually produced zygote. Passage through a unicellular bottleneck assures that each representative of the next generation of organisms represents a distinct clone. Some offspring will carry a large number of deleterious mutations and will die off, while other offspring will carry few. In this manner, the organism bypasses [...] "Muller's ratchet," [...] the process by which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner. The second defense against cheaters is the development of allorecognition mechanisms that guard against invasion by parasitic replicators. Allorecognition acts as an agent of kin selection by restricting fusion and community acceptance to related individuals. If related individuals fuse, the benefits of fusion will still apply, while the costs of competition for shared resources or reproductive opportunities will be reduced by a fraction proportional to the degree of relatedness between the fusing partners. If unrelated individuals fuse, or if a <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> arises within an organism that is distinguishable from self by the allorecognition system, a rejection response will be activated. As a general rule, rejection is mediated by the gene products of highly variable loci, which must match (or nearly match) between organisms for fusion to be successful.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{origin of}} somaclonal {{variation}} {{has not been}} questioned previously, i. e., "pre-existing mutations" in explants and "newly induced mutations" arising from the tissue culture process have not been distinguished. This is primarily {{because there has been}} no reliable molecular method for estimating or quantifying variation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We adopted a petal-variegated cultivar of Saintpaulia 'Thamires' (Saintpaulia sp.) as the model plant. Based on the difference between the pre- and post-transposon excision sequence of the promoter region of flavonoid 3 ', 5 '-hydoroxylase (F 3 ' 5 'H), we estimated mutated (transposon-excised) cell percentages using a quantitative real-time PCR. <b>Mutated</b> <b>cell</b> percentages in leaf laminae used as explants was 4. 6 and 2. 4 % in highly or low variegation flower plants, respectively, although the occurrences of blue color mutants in their regenerants were more than 40 %. Preexisting <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> percentages in cultured explants were considerably lower than the mutated plant percentage among total regenerants via tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The estimation of <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> percentages became possible using the quantitative real-time PCR. The origins of mutations were successfully distinguished; it was confirmed that somaclonal variations are mainly caused by newly generated mutations arising from tissue culture process...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) is {{associated}} with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. It is unknown whether any other mutations are needed for the chronic phase of the disease. The CML incidence increases as a function of age with an exponent of ≈ 3. A slope of 3 could indicate that there are two mutations, in addition to the Philadelphia translocation, that have not yet been discovered. In this work, we explore an alternative hypothesis: We study a model of cancer initiation requiring only a single mutation. A <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> has a net reproductive advantage over normal cells and, therefore, might give rise to clonal expansion. The cancer is detected with a probability that is proportional {{to the size of the}} <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> clone. This model has three waiting times: (i) the time until a <b>mutated</b> <b>cell</b> is produced, (ii) the time of clonal expansion, and (iii) the time until the clone is detected. Surprisingly, this simple process can give rise to cancer incidence curves with exponents up to 3. Therefore, the CML incidence data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Philadelphia translocation alone is sufficient to cause chronic phase CML...|$|E
50|$|The selfish {{spermatogonial}} selection hypothesis {{proposes that}} {{the influence of}} spermatogonial mutations in older men is further enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a selective advantage over other cells. Such an advantage would allow the <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> to increase in number through clonal expansion. In particular, mutations that affect the RAS pathway, which regulates spermatogonial proliferation, appear to offer a competitive advantage to spermatogonial cells, while also leading to diseases associated with paternal age.|$|R

The existence of molecular intra-tumoral heterogeneity has been observed in lung cancers. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate if the percentage of <b>mutated</b> neoplastic <b>cells</b> within the tumor sample might influence the responsiveness to TKIs treatment. A total of 931 cases of NSCLC were analyzed for EGFR mutational status (exon 18, 19, 20, 21) using Next Generation Sequencer. The percentage of <b>mutated</b> neoplastic <b>cells</b> was calculated after normalizing the percentage of mutated alleles obtained after next generation sequencer analysis with the percentage of neoplastic cells in each tumor. Next generation sequencing revealed an EGFR mutation in 167 samples (17. 9 %), mainly deletions in exon 19. In 18 patients treated with TKIs and with available follow-up, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of <b>mutated</b> neoplastic <b>cells</b> and the clinical response (P = 0. 017).

40|$|Genome {{instability}} is {{a recurring}} feature of tumorigenesis. Mutation in MLL 2, encoding a histone methyltransferase, is a driver in numerous different cancer types, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we present evidence that MLL 2 mutation results in genome instability. Mouse cells in which MLL 2 gene deletion can be induced display {{elevated levels of}} sister chromatid exchange, gross chromosomal aberrations, 53 BP 1 foci, and micronuclei. Human MLL 2 knockout cells are characterized by genome instability as well. Interestingly, MLL 2 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and RECQL 5, and, although MLL 2 <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> have normal overall H 3 K 4 me levels in genes, nucleosomes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of RNAPII are hypomethylated. Importantly, MLL 2 <b>mutated</b> <b>cells</b> display signs of substantial transcription stress, and the most affected genes overlap with early replicating fragile sites, show elevated levels of γH 2 AX, and suffer frequent mutation. The requirement for MLL 2 in the maintenance of genome stability in genes helps explain its widespread role in cancer and points to transcription stress as a strong driver in tumorigenesis.
