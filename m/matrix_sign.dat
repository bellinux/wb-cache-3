40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{two types of}} {{mathematical}} objects: alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrices</b> and polytopes. Alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrices</b> were first defined in 1982 by Mills, Robbins and Rumsey. Since then, alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrices</b> have led to some very captivating research (with multiple open problems still standing), an outline of which {{is presented in the}} opening chapter of this thesis. Convex polytopes are extremely relevant when considering enumerations of certain classes of integer valued matrices. An overview of the relevant properties of convex polytopes is presented, before a connection is made between polytopes and alternating sign matrices: the alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrix</b> polytope. The vertex set of this new polytope is given, as well as a generalization of standard alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrices</b> to give higher spin alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrices.</b> From a result of Ehrhart a result concerning the enumeration of these matrices is obtained, namely, that for fixed size and variable line sum the enumeration is given by a particular polynomial. In Chapter 4, we give results concerning the symmetry classes of the alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrix</b> polytope and in Chapter 3 we study symmetry classes of the Birkhoff polytope. For this classical polytope we give some new results. In the penultimate chapter, another polytope is defined that is a valid solution set of the transportation problem and for which a particular set of parameters gives the alternating <b>sign</b> <b>matrix</b> polytope.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} usage and {{applicability}} of deflation methods for the overlap lattice Dirac operator, focussing on calculating the eigenvalues using a method {{similar to the}} eigCG algorithm used for other Dirac operators. The overlap operator, which contains several theoretical advantages over other formulations of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, is more computationally expensive because it requires the computation of the <b>matrix</b> <b>sign</b> function. The principle change made compared to deflation methods for other formulations of lattice QCD {{is that it is}} necessary for best performance to tune or relax the accuracy of the <b>matrix</b> <b>sign</b> function as the computation proceeds. We adapt the eigCG algorithm for two inversion algorithms for overlap fermions, GMRESR(relCG) and GMRESR(relSUMR). Before deflation, the rate of convergence of these routines in terms of iterations is similar, but, since the Shifted Unitary Minimal Residual (SUMR) algorithm only requires one call to the <b>matrix</b> <b>sign</b> function compared to the two calls required for Conjugate Gradient (CG), SUMR is usually preferred for single inversions of the Dirac operator. We construct bounds for the required accuracy of the <b>matrix</b> <b>sign</b> function during the eigenvalue calculation. For the SUMR algorithm, we use a Galerkin projection to perform the deflation; while for the CG algorithm, we are able to use a considerably superior spectral pre-conditioner. The superior performance of the spectral preconditioner, and its need for less accurate eigenvalues, almost erodes SUMR's advantage over CG as an inversion algorithm. We see factor of three gains for the inversion algorithm from the deflation on our small test lattices. There is, however, a significant cost in the eigenvalue calculation because we cannot relax the accuracy of the <b>matrix</b> <b>sign</b> function as aggressively when calculating the eigenvalues as we do while performing the inversions...|$|E
