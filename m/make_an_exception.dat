5|$|After a full {{pre-season}} {{he started}} to play well and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate. Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but that he would <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was born}} {{five days after the}} September 15 cutoff date for {{eligibility}} in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, there was a significant effort made to allow Tavares into the Draft. Following his 72-goal campaign in 2006–07, Tavares' agents asked the NHL and NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for Tavares similar to the one the OHL had made in 2005. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a spot with the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E
25|$|Although 14.23% of India's {{population}} is Muslim, it has {{pushed for the}} OIC to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to accept India as a member, arguing that about 11% (roughly 172 million) of the Muslims live in India. Pakistan opposes India's entry into the OIC.|$|E

5000|$|Chateaubriand {{accuses the}} writers {{of the eighteenth century}} of {{misunderstanding}} God. He <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had [...] "a shadow of religion". For Chateaubriand, Voltaire is an inferior playwright to Jean Racine because Voltaire was not a Christian.|$|R
25|$|When Susannah {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} first convicts to be transported to Botany Bay, the child was ordered to be left behind and Henry and Susannah separated. Moved by their plight, a prison guard petitioned the Colonial Secretary to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> {{attracting}} considerable media attention.|$|E
25|$|Whether all {{available}} domestic remedies have been exhausted.

25|$|Another area {{of debate}} is {{the fate of}} the unevangelized (i.e. those who have never had an {{opportunity}} to hear the Christian gospel), those who die in infancy, and the mentally disabled. Some Protestants agree with Augustine that people in these categories will be damned to Hell for original sin, while others believe that God will <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> in these cases.|$|E

25|$|The then-managing {{director}} told Patrick {{that according}} {{to the terms of}} his employment contract he was only entitled to a salary and all monies earned from his professional talents (which included being a professional voice talent) rightfully belonged to the company. But as Patrick was a model employee, the managing director would <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> and allow him to keep 50% of his voice-over fees. Patrick, who was then earning up to six times his salary in voice-over fees disagreed with the new terms, and resigned from Rediffusion.|$|E
25|$|On {{reaching}} {{the age of}} sixty in 1964, Omm Sety was faced with mandatory retirement by the Antiquities Department and advised to seek part-time work in Cairo. She went to Cairo, but only stayed one day before returning to Abydos. The Antiquities Department decided to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to their retirement age rules and allowed her to continue her work at Abydos for a further five years, until she retired in 1969. Her pension of $30 per month was supplemented by needlework sold to friends and tourists, who also brought gifts of clothes, food, and reading materials.|$|E
25|$|Pei Songzhi, who {{annotated}} Yu Jin's biography in the Sanguozhi, {{commented that}} even though Yu Jin followed the book when he executed Chang Xi (who surrendered after being surrounded), he had another option – send Chang as a prisoner-of-war to Cao Cao and let his lord decide Chang's fate – that was still not considered {{a violation of the}} norms. Pei felt that Yu Jin deserved his eventual fate – ending up as a prisoner-of-war and receiving a negative-sounding posthumous title ("severe marquis") after death – because he was unwilling to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for an old friend, was inclined towards killing, and was harsh in suppressing dissent.|$|E
50|$|Bill Brady self-identifies as pro-life. He {{supports}} {{a ban on}} all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest.

25|$|Archbishop Vincent Nichols of Birmingham {{declared}} {{his opposition to}} the Act, saying that the legislation contradicted the Catholic Church's moral values. Several Catholic adoption agencies requested exemption from sexual orientation regulations, and the adoption charity Catholic Care obtained a judgement on 17 March 2010 instructing the Charity Commission to reconsider its case. The Charity Commission again found no grounds to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for Catholic Care, a decision upheld on appeal. In August 2011 the Upper Tribunal agreed to hear the charity's fourth appeal in the case. In November 2012, the appeal was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal, with the Tribunal ruling in favour of the Charity Commission. Catholic Care stated its intention to appeal the judgement.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{conflict}} between Cantacuzino and Carp, which caused the latter's cabinet to be invalidated with assistance from Conservative parliamentarians (February 1901) Sturdza returned to power triumphantly. In the 1901 suffrage, he was first elected to Chamber for the 3rd Electoral College in Iaşi. Stere largely owed his 1901 appointment as Deputy Professor at the University of Iași to his political connections: falling short of legal requirements, he asked Brătianu and Spiru Haret to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> in his case (in order to avoid breaking the law which prevented state employees from being elected deputies, he asked not to receive a salary for his first course). After he became a full Professor, his assistant at the department was Nicolae Daşcovici.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. State Department and {{the embassy}} {{actively}} began {{to support the}} position of UFCo, which was a major US company. The Guatemalan government had to fight the pressure. The US officially acknowledged that Guatemala {{had the right to}} conduct their own politics and business, but U.S. representatives said they were trying to protect UFCo, a US company that generated much revenue and contributed to the US economy. Arbenz's administration said that Guatemala needed Agrarian Reform to improve its own economy. Arbenz said he would adopt policies for a nationalist economic development if necessary. He argued that all foreign investment would be subject to Guatemalan laws. Arbenz was firm in promoting the Agrarian Reform and within a couple of years had acted quickly; he claimed that Guatemalan government was not prepared to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for the U.S. concerning Decree 900 and that it was not Guatemalan's fault that the American corporation had lied in its tax forms and declared an artificially low value on their land.|$|E
5000|$|In public {{international}} law, clausula rebus sic stantibus (Latin for [...] "things thus standing") is {{the legal}} doctrine allowing for treaties to become inapplicable because of a fundamental change of circumstances.

50|$|In most Asterix books, Obelix is not {{permitted}} to drink the Magic Potion, but Getafix <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> due to <b>an</b> extraordinary requirement (the need to force open a solid stone door inside a pyramid which apparently, even Obelix's regular level strength is incapable of doing). Obelix notices no difference, but keeps asking for more potion in subsequent volumes.|$|R

25|$|Criticism of United States {{foreign policy}} {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of opinions and views on failures and shortcoming of United States policies and actions. There is a partly-held sense in America which views America as qualitatively different from other nations and therefore cannot be judged by the same standards as other countries; this belief is sometimes termed American exceptionalism and {{can be traced to the}} so-called Manifest destiny. American exceptionalism has widespread implications and transcribes into disregard to the international norms, rules and laws in U.S. foreign policy. For example, the U.S. refused to ratify a number of important international treaties such as Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and American Convention on Human Rights; did not join the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention; and routinely conducts drone attacks and cruise missile strikes around the globe. American exceptionalism is sometimes linked with hypocrisy; for example, the U.S. keeps a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons while urging other nations not to get them, and justifies that it can <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to a policy of non-proliferation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of post-war austerity, U Hla {{continued}} to publish using any kind of paper {{that he could get}} hold of including coloured matchbox packing paper and used office paper with printing on one side. He would also still manage to send his new books as gifts, about 200 on each occasion, to all his friends in Rangoon at a time when communication lines and road and rail transportation had all but broken down. It was in 1945 that he launched the fortnightly Ludu (The People) Journal with his wife as assistant editor. The following year saw the launch of the Ludu Daily newspaper and subsequently the couple {{came to be known as}} Ludu U Hla and Ludu Daw Amar. Their incisive political commentaries and analyses made a significant contribution to the country's yearning for independence and unified struggle against colonial rule. Their publications had never carried advertisements for alcohol, drugs to enhance sexual performance or gambling, nor racing tips, salacious affairs and gossip. U Hla had to be persuaded to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> of film advertisements for the survival of the paper.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but I will <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E

500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that I am as good as any one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception,</b> and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E
500|$|At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won {{the award}} for fewest {{turnovers}} per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award [...] won by Farmer the previous three years [...] went to Gimel Martinez. Athletics director C. M. Newton surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In so doing, he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director Cliff Hagan. Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed {{from the end of}} their athletic eligibility. Newton cited the seniors' [...] "unusual and outstanding contributions" [...] to the program as reasons to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to the standards, adding, [...] "I won't say there never will be another exception, but the likelihood of another is not great." [...] Sportscaster Cris Collinsworth protested Newton's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like Kyle Macy and Rick Robey.|$|E

I'll <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> for the VMAs." [...] Aguilera discussed the concept of the performance beforehand saying: [...] "You're going to get a first look and a first listen at my new image and my new sound.

The performance began with Aguilera standing in a tower of neon-lit boxes, singing [...] "Genie 2.0" [...] while wearing second-skin leather catsuit accessorized with silver armbands, a black-leather cat mask, black cape and platinum-blond hair. Then, she began performing [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better". Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the performance [...] "sassy, slickly-choreographed".|$|E
