5|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no {{more sensitive}} than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> {{the urban}} myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself had just returned to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E

25|$|Some {{newspapers}} {{have dealt with}} the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to the editorial page, because <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that a politically based comic strip like Doonesbury does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section. The Lincoln Journal started the trend in 1973. In some papers (such as the Tulsa World and Orlando Sentinel) Doonesbury appears on the opinions page alongside Mallard Fillmore, a politically conservative comic strip.|$|E
25|$|Even though 2012 {{marked the}} first Olympic Games in which every country sent women athletes to compete, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that the Olympic Games are far from {{reaching}} gender equality. This belief {{is evidenced by the}} fact that the number of women participating in the Olympics is still significantly less than the number of men competing. The 2012 Olympic Games did mark the highest percentage of women athletes ever, though, at 45%.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that Krasner {{stopped working}} in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never stopped {{creating}} art. Throughout her career, she went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of her self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): it {{is often}} unclear whether a common name is {{actually}} part of an official geographical name, e.g. <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> Fertő tó is the actual name of Fertő Lake so they write it with a hyphen, while the name is only Fertő, thus a space must be used before tó. In addition, names like Szahara sivatag (‘Sahara Desert’) or Urál hegység ‘Ural Mountains’ don’t contain the common name, so no hyphen must be used, {{as opposed to the}} Kaszpi-tenger type.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that Benny appears {{behind the}} wheel of his Maxwell in the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but in fact it was a 1932 Cadillac.] The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was cast—with a stunt driver at the wheel—and the role was {{intended}} for Stan Laurel (which is why the character wears a derby, which Jack almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play it. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.|$|E

25|$|The Prime Minister nominates the Cabinet, {{traditionally}} {{drawn from}} members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution. Reflecting its monarchical past, Norway was established under the Lutheran Church of Norway, and was the state church until 2012. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of Cabinet be members of the Church of Norway, meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries. This rule was however removed in 2012. The issue of {{separation of church and state}} in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.|$|E

500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of my job to take it and I wanted to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty." ...|$|E

In 2002 the show paid tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the season 13 finale to his memory. Gould had died two days before the episode aired.|$|E
500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman {{as well as a}} response from Lane on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Since 1994, Hewson {{has been}} a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International (shortened to Chernobyl Children International in 2010), an {{organisation}} founded and run by Roche that works with children, families, and communities that continue {{to be affected by}} Chernobyl. Through the years, Hewson has taken at least ten trips to Belarus and other nations in the region despite the risk to her health. [...] She has organised overland aid convoys and sometimes driven ambulances filled with medical supplies herself; in one case she had to retreat quickly when a fire spread in a village a few miles from Chernobyl. [...] Hewson has made sure her own children met those from Chernobyl with birth deformities and other illnesses, so that they would have a broader appreciation of the world and what to be thankful for. She has said that fundraising for those affected is very difficult, given that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> the problems of Chernobyl are all in the past.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980 campaign, former California Governor Ronald Reagan {{projected}} an easy self-confidence, {{in contrast}} to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. What <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> to be Carter's personal attention to detail, his pessimistic attitude, his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people were accentuated {{in contrast to}} what <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believed,</b> Reagan's charismatic charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates. Reagan used the economic problems, Iran hostage crisis, and lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Like his immediate predecessor, Gerald Ford, Carter did not serve a second term as president. Among those who were elected as president, Carter was the first since Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.|$|R
50|$|In the post-Khrushchev years, {{the leading}} anti-religious {{periodical}} ‘Science and Religion’ adopted {{a new approach}} wherein it adopted a dialogue with believers by printing portions of letters to the periodical and then responding to them. Typically the periodical preferred to print believers’ letters that contained assertions that were easier to argue against. For example, a believer might write a letter that argued God must have existed because <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> in Him and they couldn’t all have been wrong, and the periodical would then respond by noting {{that there were many}} cases in history wherein <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> something that was discovered to be false, such as a flat Earth or even the pagan religions that came before Christianity.|$|R

500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." [...] The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack. It {{was a part of the}} [...] "AIDS JaaGo" [...] ("AIDS Awake"), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.|$|E
500|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that Donen owed {{everything}} to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having [...] "no particular identity or evident talent... {{and was just}} a kid from the south who wanted to make it in show business." [...] Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public, such as berating him {{for not being able to}} keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for Cover Girl. Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of It's Always Fair Weather. After Donen's recent hits Deep in My Heart and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the Budweiser Clydesdales. These horses were first owned by the Budweiser Brewery at the end of Prohibition in the United States, and have since become an {{international}} symbol of both the breed and the brand. The Budweiser breeding program, with its strict standards of colour and conformation, have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> that Clydesdales are always bay with white markings. As well as being driven, some Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle. Due to their calm disposition they have proven to be very easy to train as well as capable of making exceptional trial horses. Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British Household Cavalry as drum horses, leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions. The horses are eye-catching colours, including piebald, skewbald and roan. To be used for this purpose, a drum horse must stand a minimum of [...] high. They carry the Musical Ride Officer and two silver drums weighing [...] each.|$|E
