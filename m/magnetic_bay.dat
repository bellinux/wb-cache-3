During the moderately active period, 88 % of all substorms were associated with southward interplanetary magnetic fields. Conversely, 80 % of all large southward IMF events were associated with auroral-zone negative bays; during some events, however, magnetic bays could not be found, even by using high-latitude stations.

30|$|Finally, we {{conclude}} that {{an increase in the}} solar wind dynamic pressure as early as before substorm growth path results {{in the formation of the}} magnetospheric conditions that impede the isolated substorm generation. Therefore, more energy is required to be uploaded into the magnetosphere to generate a substorm. Subsequently, this energy will be released during the substorm expansion phase, generating more intense <b>magnetic</b> <b>bays.</b> We still do not exclude the possibility of alternative explanation of our results; however, at present our concept seems to be the most realistic.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are some}} {{differences}} in the properties between the EEASs and the omega bands as follows: (a) It is deduced from the simultaneous observations of Pi 2 pulsations and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> variations associated with the DP- 1 current system that each EEAS was observed just after each onset of a multiple-onset substorm, whereas omega bands are usually observed during the substorm recovery phase. (b) The propagation speed of the EEASs (about 3 – 4  km/s) is faster than that of omega bands (0.4 – 2  km/s). (c) The period of the magnetic pulsations accompanying the EEASs (4 – 6  min) is shorter {{than that of the}} omega bands (5 – 40  min). (d) The direction of the ionospheric equivalent current of the EEASs appears to be different from that of omega bands.|$|E
30|$|Since the EEASs coincided quite {{precisely}} with Pi 2 pulsations {{near the}} magnetic equator and <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> variations {{associated with the}} DP- 1 current system, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that they occurred just after substorm onsets. Nakamura et al. (1993) investigated the auroral evolution during the substorm expansion phase using all-sky TV data and demonstrated that the discrete auroral structures within the poleward expanding bulge developed not only westward but also eastward and equatorward. The eastward-propagating aurora and the north-south-aligned aurora eventually develop into a diffuse and pulsating aurora after the expansion. They suggested that these discrete auroral structures in the bulge should be attributed to the plasma streamlines in the magnetosphere. The auroral streamers in the poleward region and the N-S auroras shown in the present study (Fig.  3) may be associated with the eastward-propagating aurora and the N-S aurora shown by Nakamura et al. (1993), respectively.|$|E
30|$|Magnitude ΔX of the X-component <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> {{is used to}} {{characterize}} the global structure of magnetic activity and the ionospheric electrojet intensity. To quantify {{the magnitude of the}} magnetic field variability, time derivatives dX/dt and dY/dt are calculated. The earlier examinations of ΔB and dB/dt spatial structures revealed the occurrence of localized (scales about 103  km and less) structures embedded in the main electrojet (Viljanen 1997). Current amplitudes in such structures can be small, so they hardly can be discriminated from global ΔB pattern. However, the temporal changes associated with these medium-scale structures are fast, so they are clearly seen in the dB/dt distribution. In magnetograms, this feature is observed during disturbed periods as a large Δ X ≫Δ Y, but about equal time derivatives dX/dt and dY/dt (Viljanen et al. 2001). Therefore, for the analysis we use the magnitude of the total time derivative of the horizontal magnetic component | dB/dt| = √((dX/dt)^ 2 + (dY/dt)^ 2).|$|E

Clear resonant transient Psc 5 oscillations are independently generated on the morning and evening flanks, but no signatures of theoretically predicted cavity mode excitation have been found. We could not find a reliable in situ confirmation of the mechanism of PI generation owing to mode conversion at the front of fast mode propagation through the magnetosphere. The observed poleward propagation pattern of the dayside PI contradicts the model of instantaneous atmospheric THo mode transmission. Though the SC amplitude is much less than the amplitude of the subsequent substorm <b>magnetic</b> <b>bays,</b> the GIC intensity at the Kola Peninsula power lines caused by the SC is higher than the GIC during the substorm intensifications.|$|R

The aurora was observed at high magnetic latitudes indicating that the electron precipitation source moved northward as the geomagnetic activity decreased. The events we have studied indicate that the solar wind density alone is not the primary parameter that controls the auroral activity. The weak auroral activity was observed with 150 nT <b>magnetic</b> <b>bays</b> and when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz was small and positive resulting in small _ parameter.

40|$|We report multi-spacecraft and {{ground-based}} {{observations of}} a "sawtooth" event on 20 November 2007. For this event, data from three THEMIS, two GOES, and four LANL spacecraft are available {{as well as}} those from extensively distributed ground magnetometers and all-sky imagers. In the present paper we focus on the spatial extents of the electromagnetic and particle signatures of the first "tooth". In this event, auroral images and ground magnetic bays showed two activations: a pseudo onset and a major onset (we use the term pseudo onset since the former auroral brightening did not significantly expand poleward). Ground <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> observations indicate that the substorm current wedge (SCW) developed after the major onset in an azimuthally wide region of ~ 14 – 3 h MLT. Similarly, broad <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> distribution was observed also for the pseudo onset prior to the major onset. Furthermore, around the pseudo onset, magnetic dipolarisations were observed from 0. 5 to 5 h MLT. These observations illustrate that, during sawtooth events, activities following not only the major onset but also the pseudo onset can extend more widely than those during usual substorms. Remarkable electromagnetic field fluctuations embedded in the dipolarisation trend were seen at 0. 5 and 2. 5 h MLT. In particular, comprehensive plasma and field data from THEMIS showed the presence of a long-excited weak magnetosonic wave and an impulsive large-amplitude Alfvén wave with an earthward Poynting flux at around the eastward edge of the SCW; the latter was sufficiently strong for powering aurora (140 mW/m 2 when mapped to the ionosphere). These two activations of the electromagnetic wave were identified, corresponding to the pseudo onset and the major onset. On the other hand, the dipolarisation at geosynchronous 0 h MLT was observed only after the major onset, despite its closer location to the centre of the auroral activity in terms of the MLT; this indicates that the inner radial limit of the dipolarisation region at the pseudo onset was tailward of geosynchronous altitude at 0 h MLT. The outer radial limit of the electron injection region was also found at ~ 10 R E by conjunction measurements with THEMIS satellites. These radial distributions are not significantly different to those expected for usual substorms...|$|E

There are two free parameters in the model which scale the contributions to AL from the directly-driven DP 2 electrojet and loading-unloading DP 1 electrojet, respectively. In a limited region of the 2 -D parameter space of the model, the probability distribution of modelled substorm bay magnitudes is not significantly different to the observed distribution. The ranges of the two parameters giving acceptable (95 % confidence level) agreement are consistent with expectations using results from other studies. The approximately linear {{relationship between the two}} free parameters over these ranges implies that the substorm magnitude simply scales linearly with the solar wind power input at the time of substorm onset...|$|E

The nighttime precipitation commences almost simultaneously {{with the onset of}} the nightside <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay,</b> while the dayside precipitation is delayed by 10 - 100 min.

30|$|Magnetic bays at VM {{correspond}} to the occurrence of all 6 auroral activations (Fig.  2, bottom panels), though the magnitudes of the magnetic bays are not linearly proportional to the pertinent AE values. Period # 1 (06 – 11  UT) was thoroughly examined by Lyons et al. (2016) using optical, radar, and magnetometer data from the North American sector. Irregular disturbances during this time interval were interpreted to result from rapid poleward/equatorward expansions and auroral streamers of various intensities. VM also demonstrates the fine structure of this disturbed period and indicates onsets of each <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> more clearly than the AE index. In particular, VM shows the occurrence of several substorm-like activations (especially evident from VM for the Southern hemisphere), which are hard to distinguish from AE index data only. Besides that, VMs provide qualitative visual information about the day–night coupling and N–S asymmetry. For example, during activation # 1, VMs give a possibility to discriminate a dayside response to Ey increase, and a nightside substorm. At the same time, VM characterizes the nighttime activity throughout the day better than AE index or the IMAGE electrojet index IE (not shown). The SuperMAG SME index for this event has an off-set about 400  nT with the standard AE index (Fig.  1).|$|E

In all, 5 dipolarizations are observed, each associated with the closure of ~ 0. 1 GWb of flux.

40|$|A superposed epoch {{analysis}} of 100 – 300 substorms is performed {{to determine the}} median {{size and shape of}} the substorm-associated VLF chorus, <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay,</b> and Pi 2 pulsation burst observed at the near-auroral Halley research station, Antarctica, and at the midlatitude Faraday station at three different local times (2230, 2330, 0130 MLT). The spatial and temporal properties of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> signatures are compared with the University of York implementation of the Kisabeth–Rostoker substorm current wedge (SCW) model and the Weimer pulse model, respectively. These constitute the best analytical models of the substorm to date. It is shown that the polarities and relative amplitudes of the observed magnetic bays in the H, D, and Z components at Halley at midnight MLT and at Faraday in the premidnight sector are consistent with the York model for a SCW 3 hours wide in MLT with its westward electrojet at 67 °S magnetic latitude. In particular the little-discussed Z component of the bay agrees with the model and is shown to be the clearest substorm signature of the three components, especially at midlatitude. The midnight and postmidnight bays are similar to the premidnight case but progressively smaller and cannot be fully reconciled with the model. The shape of the H and Z bays at Halley and the D bays at Faraday fit a normalized Weimer pulse well, with Weimer's 2 h− 1 recovery rate, but the other components do not. The D component at Halley and H at Faraday do fit the Weimer pulse shape but with a faster recovery rate of 4 h− 1. It is proposed that {{this is due to the}} effect of a decaying current in the SCW combining with the geometrical effect of changing SCW configuration and position relative to the observing station. The Z component at Faraday recovers more slowly than the 2 h− 1 Weimer prediction; we cannot explain this. Secondary bays at Halley and Faraday show a clear tendency to recur after 2 hours. Inflection points just prior to onset at Halley and Faraday are argued to be related to reduced convection associated with northward turning of the IMF. The median substorm signature at Halley in the Pi 2 frequency band (7 – 25 mHz) is well correlated with the bay structure, showing that it is part of a broader band, possibly turbulent, spectrum in the substorm-dependent DP 2 current. There is evidence of a minor additional narrow band component occurring at substorm onset. This is the dominant signal at Faraday which shows the classic midlatitude substorm signature, a short Pi 2 pulsation burst at onset, that decreases progressively in intensity with increasing local time, implying a source region biased to the evening side or else preferred propagation to the east from a near-midnight source. ...|$|E
3000|$|... /∂t. Keika et al. (2009) {{proposed}} that the inductive downward electric field on the SC compressional front propagating from the dayside magnetopause is a probable candidate for triggering a substorm, but not the disturbances generated by {{the motion of the}} flank magnetopause. In the case under examination, the IMF is northward {{both before and after the}} SC, which excludes the possibility of substorm triggering associated with a southward IMF. A possible trigger may be transported by a fast compression front from the dayside magnetopause via the magnetosphere or by a disturbance of the solar wind flow around the magnetopause. According to our observations and timing estimates, the inductive downward electric field transported through the magnetosphere to the magnetotail by a fast mode front may be a probable candidate to trigger the substorm. However, whether all substorms are triggered is still a controversial issue, because not all magnetic bays are associated with auroral substorms. Although ~ 50 % of the IP shocks do produce negative magnetic bays at nightside, only less than 10 % of the SC causes an auroral breakup (Liou et al. 2003). Therefore, it is likely that the observed <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> at PBK is not associated with the auroral breakup but with enhanced convection due to a sudden compression and should be classified as a “compression bay.” [...]...|$|E
30|$|Three eastward-expanding auroral surges (EEASs) were {{observed}} intermittently at intervals of about 15  min in the post-midnight sector (1 : 55 – 2 : 40 MLT) by all-sky imagers and magnetometers in northern Europe. From the simultaneous observation of Pi 2 pulsations at the magnetic equator and <b>magnetic</b> <b>bay</b> variations at middle-to-high latitudes {{associated with the}} DP- 1 current system, it is deduced that each EEAS occurred just after each onset of a multiple-onset substorm, which was small-scale and did not expand to the premidnight sector. The EEASs have similar characteristics to omega bands or torches, such as recurrence intervals of about 15  min, concurrence with magnetic pulsations with an amplitude of several tens of nanotesla, horizontal scales of 300 – 400  km, and occurrence of pulsating auroras in the diffuse auroral region {{after the passage of}} the EEASs. In addition to these similarities, the temporal evolution of the EEASs, showing that the eastward-propagating auroral streamers simultaneously occur in the poleward region and eventually connect with the EEASs, {{is similar to that of}} omega bands. Thus, we speculate that the EEASs may be related to the generation process of the omega bands. On the other hand, there are some differences in the characteristics between the EEASs and omega bands, i.e., faster eastward propagation (3 – 4  km/s), resulting in a shorter period of magnetic pulsations (4 – 6  min), and a different direction for the ionospheric equivalent current. The fast eastward propagation of the EEAS may be interpreted as the movement of eastward expansion fronts of the substorm current wedge. The difference in the ionospheric current between the EEASs and omega bands may be caused by a large temporal variation in the surge structure, compared with the more stable wavy structure of omega bands.|$|E
40|$|A {{discussion}} is given of plasma flows in the dawn and nightside high-latitude ionospheric regions during substorms occurring on a contracted auroral oval, as observed using the EISCAT CP- 4 -A experiment. Supporting {{data from the}} PACE radar, Greenland magnetometer chain, SAMNET magnetometers and geostationary satellites are compared to the EISCAT observations. On 4 October 1989 a weak substorm with initial expansion phase onset signatures at 0030 UT, resulted in the convection reversal boundary observed by EISCAT (at ~ 0415 MLT) contracting rapidly poleward, causing a band of elevated ionospheric ion temperatures and a localised plasma density depletion. This polar cap contraction event is shown {{to be associated with}} various substorm signatures; Pi 2 pulsations at mid-latitudes, <b>magnetic</b> <b>bays</b> in the midnight sector and particle injections at geosynchronous orbit. A similar event was observed on the following day around 0230 UT (~ 0515 MLT) with the unusual and significant difference that two convection reversals were observed, both contracting poleward. We show that this feature is not an ionospheric signature of two active reconnection neutral lines as predicted by the near-Earth neutral model before the plasmoid is &quot;pinched off&quot;, and present two alternative explanations in terms of (1) viscous and lobe circulation cells and (2) polar cap contraction during northward IMF. The voltage associated with the anti-sunward flow between the reversals reaches a maximum of 13 kV during the substorm expansion phase. This suggests it {{to be associated with the}} polar cap contraction and caused by the reconnection of open flux in the geomagnetic tail which has mimicked &quot;viscous-like&quot; momentum transfer across the magnetopause...|$|R
30|$|Consecutive {{bursts of}} Pi 2 {{pulsations}} are examined with magnetic field {{data obtained by}} the SMALL array in 1999. With reference to the H-component <b>magnetic</b> <b>bays</b> in the high-latitude magnetograms at CPMN, 10 events consisting of two consecutive Pi 2 bursts simultaneously observed by the Beijing (BJI, L = 1.46) and Wuhan (WHN, L = 1.20) stations are identified as associated with substorm onsets. Owing to the same waveform seen by the CPMN and IGPP/LANL arrays, they are the global phenomena. Their occurrences are mostly in the 2100 – 2300 LT (local time) sector in which the dominant frequencies at WHN are higher than the mean frequency, but those at BJI are lower {{and close to the}} frequency of the surface wave at the plasmapause. Moreover, the LT dependence of azimuth and polarization of two consecutive Pi 2 bursts at BJI and WHN are analyzed and consistent with the ULF waves theory by Itonaga and Yumoto (1998). GOES 8 and GOES 10 confirm the formation of the substorm current wedge after the onsets of two Pi 2 bursts. Thus during substorm onsets, Pi 2 pulsations at low latitudes may result from hydromagnetic waves driven by an impulsive source in the magnetotail which could commence in the longitude of 2230 LT and later propagate westward and eastward as well. Low-latitude Pi 2 waves near the source site may be affected by several factors as they propagate by the stimulation of a surface wave at the plasmapause, by a localized field line oscillation inside the plasmapause, and by the magnetospheric/plasmaspheric cavity (resonance) mode.|$|R

These electric fields provide the driving force for localized ionospheric currents, the auroral electrojets, which flow within the regions of enhanced ionization provided by the visible auroral forms. It is shown that auroral arcs and bands are apparently ordinarily so oriented as to have their horizontal axes perpendicular to these electric fields. It is further shown that if the auroral zone magnetic field lines are equipotentials, adiabatic acceleration and precipitation of electrons will occur. In the event that the motion of the electrons is not entirely adiabatic, but involves slow diffusion in pitch angle, precipitation will still occur. Either of these processes will lead to the precipitation of electrons in extended regions of glow, and to the development of a pitch angle distribution which is highly peaked outside of the loss cone. With such a pitch angle distribution, the distortion of ionospheric electric and magnetic fields associated with localized auroral electrojets leads to a modulation of auroral precipitation, giving parallel bright and dark bands of auroral emission, which are aligned nearly perpendicular to the ionospheric electric field...|$|R
