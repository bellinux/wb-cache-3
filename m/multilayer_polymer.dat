To facilitate the design and development of <b>multilayered</b> <b>polymer</b> films, the impact of thermal aging on the mechanical behavior of micro- and nano-layered polymer films has been investigated experimentally. The composition of the polymer films that have been studied is 50 vol% polycarbonate (PC) and 50 vol% poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The current study focuses {{on the effect of}} film and layer thickness and temperature on the mechanical properties of the materials subjected to thermal aging. To study the effect of film and layer thickness, films with the same thickness, but various layer thicknesses, and films with the same layer thickness, but various film thicknesses, were thermally aged at 100 °C in a constant temperature oven for up to six weeks. The results show that as the layer thickness decreases to 31 nm, the film has a higher stiffness and strength, and the trend of the mechanical properties is relatively stable over aging. The ductility of all of the films decreases with aging time. To study the effect of temperature, the films with 4, 096 layers (31 nm thick for each layer) were aged at 100 °C, 115 °C and 125 °C for up to four weeks. While the 100 °C aging results in a slight increase of the stiffness and strength of the films, the higher aging temperature caused a decrease of the stiffness and strength of the films. The ductility decreases with the aging time for all of the temperatures. The films become more brittle for higher aging temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{measurement}} of {{the thickness of the}} individual acoustically thin layers in multilayered structures has received considerable attention. In most cases, the difficulties of the measurements are due to the multiple reflection from the boundaries; hence the problem is usually solved in the frequency domain where the resonance structure of the frequency response is analyzed [1]. In the case of polymer structures the {{problem of the}} inversion of the ultrasonic data for the thickness of all layers is complicated by the high ultrasonic absorption and weak reflection from the internal boundaries. The other difficulty is the curvature of the specimen affected by the measurement [2]. The difficulties in carrying out such characterizations stem {{from the fact that the}} received signal is dependent not only on the acoustic properties of the layers, but also on the orientation, shape, surface properties, location and dimensions of the interfaces [3]. Distortion of the ultrasonic beam will take place if the interface is curved within the ultrasonic beam width. This distorts the geometry of the displayed structure, smears the resolution, and in the extreme case, can rise to duplicate image artifacts [4]. In the inspection of objects with a curved surface, the pulse interacts with complicated environments, the pulse spectral decomposition and synthesis is inapplicable because of difficulties associated with the response to each spectral component. Therefore, the interface between the different high absorptive layers in <b>multilayered</b> <b>polymer</b> composite, are not easy to observe and measure.

We first study the impact of layered polymer plate involving small deformation using a thermodynamic framework. The constitutive equations are nonlinear even though the strains are small. Six different protocols involving PU and PC, namely pure PC, pure PU, bilayer(PU/PC and PC/PU) and trilayer(PU/PC/PU and PC/PU/PC) were considered to evaluate the performance of the layering sequence based on the kinetic energy transferred on the wall. The interfaces are assumed to be fully bonded. The material parameters for the model was obtained from the experimental creep data from the literature. The layering of polymers improved the performance of plate depending upon the type of layering sequence. In the one and two dimensional study carried out, the performance was best when a compliant layer is placed between two stiff layers. Whereas, when a stiff layer was placed between two less compliant layer, the performance was worse than bilayer. Finally, a thermodynamically consistent finite deformation model was used to evaluate the impact performance of layered plate involving large deformation. A full scale three dimensional impact analysis was carried out with the thermal phenomena suppressed. Similar to the small deformation study, six different protocols were considered.
