40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the question: Is water-filling {{appropriate}} for watermarking? The water-filling paradigm is a traditional solution to the capacity maximization of parallel zero-mean additive white Gaussian channels subject to a signal energy constraint. In this work, we take an information theoretic approach to analyze the watermark communication problem {{in the presence of}} perceptual coding. Our effective watermark channel is modeled as a set of parallel independent zero-mean uniformly distributed additive noise channels. Energy allocation principles are identified to maximize the capacity results. Our findings are compared to the traditional water-filling solution and shed light on strategies to maximize the data hiding rate in the presence of compression. 1. INTRODUCTION The research area of watermarking has resulted in an incredible number of algorithmic proposals suited to the diverse needs of <b>multimedia</b> <b>industries.</b> One can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer number of mod [...] ...|$|R
