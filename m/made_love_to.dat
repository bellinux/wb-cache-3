5|$|Rosalind, Perowne's wife, is {{the last}} to arrive home. As she enters, Baxter and an {{accomplice}} 'Nige' force their way in armed with knives. Baxter punches the grandfather, intimidates the family and orders Daisy to strip naked. When she does, Perowne notices that she is pregnant. Finding out she is a poet, Baxter asks her to recite a poem. Rather than one of her own, she recites Dover Beach, which affects Baxter emotionally, effectively disarming him. Instead he becomes enthusiastic about Perowne's renewed talk about new treatment for Huntington's disease. After his companion abandons him, Baxter is overpowered by Perowne and Theo, and knocked unconscious after falling down the stairs. That night Perowne is summoned {{to the hospital for}} a successful emergency operation on Baxter. Saturday ends at around 5:15a.m. on Sunday, after he has returned from the hospital and <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> his wife again.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

25|$|Maeno had {{difficulty}} in getting work in film, and began appearing in softcore pornographic films {{because of the}} better money. By 1976, {{more than two-thirds of}} Japan's films were in the pink film genre in which Maeno appeared. Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest studio, had been specializing in these softcore pink films since late 1971, and by {{the time of his death}} he had appeared in about twenty of the company's roman porno films. He had most recently appeared in his best-known role, Nikkatsu's Tokyo Emmanuelle (1976), for which he received screen billing. In this film he <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> the popular actress Kumi Taguchi while flying a plane. The film was the half-Caucasian Taguchi's debut for Nikkatsu, having appeared previously in films for Toei, including Tokyo Deep Throat (1975). Tokyo Emmanuelle later became the first of Nikkatsu's roman pornos to be distributed in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Gentle {{makes it}} to the top of the palace where he {{encounters}} the Autarch, who reveals that Gentle is the Maestro Sartori, who led the failed effort to reconcile the dominions 200 years before. Going to see the Pivot, Gentle is told that he has to make another attempt at reconciliation. Through explanation by the Autarch and a vision he witnesses, the true events of what happened 200 years before are finally revealed. As Sartori, he was in love with Judith, the lover of Joshua Godolphin, and was able to convince Joshua to let him create a replica of her through magic. During the long process of replicating her however, he got drunk and went into the circle that she was being replicated in, and <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her. This resulted in a replica of himself being created as well. Once the reconciliation failed, the replica of Sartori left to the dominions and eventually became the ruler of them as the Autarch. The original Judith became his queen, Quaisoir, while the replica, the Judith we've come to know throughout the book, remained on Earth, bound to the Godolphin family. Sartori convinced Pie to cast a feit on him that caused him to continuously lose his memory of the event. The Autarch wants Gentle to join him as he goes to conquer the Fifth Dominion but Gentle refuses. While fleeing, Pie comes across the Autarch, and attacks Gentle when he arrives. Although Gentle is able to convince Pie that it's the real him, the Autarch (referred to from this point on through the rest of the book as 'Sartori') attacks Pie, mortally wounding him, then escapes.|$|E
500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing he would tell the director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly went off and <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E

[...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproarâ€” one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm.

500|$|His tragic efforts, however, were {{consistently}} ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber {{in the role}} of Richard III <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738â€“39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|E

2500|$|Freudian {{and other}} sexual psychologists say that Presley is a [...] "classic {{example of the}} mother/Madonna/whore split". He [...] "adored his mother and never {{recovered}} from her early death." [...] He met Priscilla [...] "when she was 14. She became a mother at 23. It is said that Elvis never <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her again {{after the birth of}} his daughter, and would never have sex with a woman who had had a baby. He did not remarry after his divorce from Priscilla and did not have any more children." [...] However, Priscilla Presley states in her autobiography that they did have sex again after the birth of their daughter, and actress Barbara Leigh, who had a relationship with the singer after the birth of her own child, claimed that they made love often, despite Elvis' being aware of her child. Both accounts contradict claims made that Elvis would not have sex with a woman who had had a child.|$|E

Priscilla states in her book, [...] "My relationship with Mike had now developed into an affair. I still loved Elvis greatly, but over the next few months I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny." [...] She later states [...] "Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness." [...] A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite.

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her, I had her, I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E

2500|$|Lyrics on {{the album}} deal with various subjects. [...] "Raised on Rock" [...] is a song about Scorpions' {{philosophy}} of life. Meine explained [...] "We all started listening the music and growing up with the music back in the 60s". Schenker also added [...] ""Raised on Rock" [...] is our soundtrack {{and it will be}} our soundtrack until the end of our days. It's the reason why we formed the band." [...] Songs [...] "Let's Rock", [...] "Rock Zone" [...] and [...] "Spirit of Rock" [...] deal with the same subject. [...] "Sting in the Tail" [...] is a song about attitude and as Schenker said [...] "it is really a great symbol of what the Scorpions are all about". [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] is an anti-war song about soldiers in Afghanistan and all the people around the world who stand for freedom and peace. Meine explained [...] "We all live in trouble times. I think that song is trying to express that kind of feeling". Lyrics for the song were inspired by the conversation between Meine and his friend who was preparing to go to Afghanistan for eight months. Meine said: [...] "In between the lines I could hear, 'Well, letâ€™s hope I come back home alive'." [...] "Lorelei" [...] is a song about the legend of the water-spirit Lorelei who lives {{on the top of the}} rock Loreley above the river Rhine. [...] "SLY" [...] is the fictional song about a girl named Sly. Meine explained [...] "When [...] "Still Loving You" [...] was a smash hit back in the '80s, many folks <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> that song, obviously.

2500|$|Most notably, Hirschfeld {{testified that}} [...] "homosexuality {{was part of}} the plan of nature and {{creation}} just like normal love." [...] Hirschfeld's testimony caused outrage all over Germany. The Die Vossische Zeitung newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as [...] "a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience". The Die MÅ«nchener Neuesten Nachrichten newspaper declared in an editorial: [...] "Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!". A notable witness at the trial was Lilly von Elbe, the former wife of Moltke who testified that her husband had only <b>made</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her twice in their entire marriage. Elbe spoke with remarkable openness for the period of her sexual desires and her frustration with a husband who was only interested in having sex with Eulenburg. Elbe's testimony was marked by moments of low comedy when it emerged that she had taken to attacking Moltke with a frying pan in vain attempts to make him have sex with her. The fact that General von Moltke was unable to defend himself from his wife's attacks was taken as proof that he was deficient in his masculinity, which many saw as confirming his homosexuality. At the time, the subject of female sexuality was taboo, and Elbe's testimony was very controversial, with many saying that Elbe must in some way be mentally ill because of her willingness to acknowledge her sexuality. At the time, it was generally believed that women should not have any sort of sexuality, and the idealized woman was seen as a [...] "chaste" [...] and [...] "pure" [...] in her asexuality. Letters to the newspapers at the time from both men and women overwhelmingly condemned Elbe for her [...] "disgusting" [...] testimony concerning her sexuality. As an expert witness, Hirschfeld also testified that female sexuality was natural, and Elbe was just a normal woman who was in no way mentally ill. After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury's decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld. He overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals [...] "have the morals of dogs" [...] and insisted that this verdict could not be allowed to stand.|$|E
