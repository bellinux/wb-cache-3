Being able to predict the phase equilibria at reduced pressures of systems composed either only of fatty acid esters as well as also of their mixtures with alcohols, is of major relevance for the design, optimization and operation of industrial facilities producing these compounds, or their use as fuels. In the present work, the Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) was applied to predict the isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria of six binary systems composed of ethyl/methyl fatty acid esters from laurate to linoleate in the pressure range 0. 5 - 13. 3 kPa, and the isothermal phase equilibria of the binary systems tetradecane + ethyl caproate/ethyl myristate at temperatures from 373. 15 to 453. 15 K.

40|$|One of the {{classical}} protection mechanism of cancer cells involves an increased expression of drug efflux transport proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gP). P-gP is an ABC drug efflux transporter which is fisiologically express in many tissues such as the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) where it {{is involved in the}} protection of the CNS from potentially toxic agents. This protein is able to transport a wild structural different substrates, including many drugs used for a wild range of therapeutic applications. Therefore, the research of safe and effective P-gP inhibitors endowed of high selectivity and potency represent a great challenge in medicinal chemistry. In particular, the possibility to have selective molecules able to inhibit this protein could be useful to modulate the pharmacological behaviour of drugs including those used for chemo-therapy-resistant tumors. Up to now many agents modulating P-gP have been characterized including channel blockers, calmodulin antagonists, immunosuppressant and protein kinase inhibitors but all these compounds produced disappointing results in vivo because the use of high dose resulting in unacceptable toxicity. Some new drugs such as biricodar, tariquidar and elacridar have satisfactory inhibitory effects on P-gP. This latter displayed a high potency for P-gP transporter but it also inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCPR). On the basis of computational studies which suggested a general pharmacophore of a substrate/inhibitor of P-gP transporter, in which both a planar aromatic domain and a presence of a basic nitrogen atom within an extended side chain are described, we designed and synthesised new compounds. These molecules possessed a benzylethereal side chain substituted by aliphatic spacer of 2, 3, or 4 methylenes linked to an arylpiperazine nucleus. All the synthesized compounds have been tested in vitro to evaluated the inhibitor activity on Caco 2 cells in which P-gP is overexpressed and the best results have been obtained for compounds having a four methylene chain. Unfortunatelly, as expected, all arylpiperazine classes displayed hight serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 A and dopaminergic D 2 receptor affinities. In order to improve P-gP affinity and eliminate serotoninergic and dopaminergic activities some structural manipulations on these derivatives have been carried out such as the substitution of the aryl and arylpiperazine moieties with a <b>methylic</b> and tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleuses respectively. Besides new ligand series arylmethyloxyphenyl 1, 2, 3 were prepared by removing the alkylpiperazinic ring and linking arylmethyl groups directly to the phenoxyalkyl nucleous. Moreover the replacemant of the oxygen atom with a nitrogen one led to arylmethylaminophenyl 2 derivatives more potent than the oxygen-analogues, which behaved as elacridar but displayed a more simple structure. However, in N-methylpiperazine series the spacer length poorly influenced the P-gP inhibitory activity. On other hand, analogously to the arylpiperazine-derivatives, also within the tetrahydroisoquinoline-derivatives, the spacer elongation improved P-gP inhibitory activity. Since the limit of P-gP inhibitors such as elacridar is the poor selectivity toward other ABC transporters, in particular the BCRP pump, all the active compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit [3 H]-mitoxantrone, a specific BCRP substrate. The results showed that only arylmethylaminephenyl derivatives displayed a good BCRP inhibition activity. These results led us to consider the 2 -[(3 -methoxyphenylethyl) phenoxy]- fragment, present in the more selective P-gP inhibitors, the pivotal molecular basis to design novel P-gP inhibitors.

The transesterification was studied at temperatures between 60 and 200 °C, in an alcohol:oil molar ratio of 40 : 1, 2 h reaction time, stirring at 700 rpm and different catalyst amounts (from 1 % to 10 % based on oil weight). The biodiesel yield was analyzed in a gas chromatographer. Synthesised and recovered catalyst were characterized for their physical and textural properties. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) {{have been used}} to study the thermal behavior of the zinc aluminate spinel. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the spinel-type structure, which was confirmed by Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. The particle and pore sizes were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and He pycnometry respectively. The specific surface area was determined by BET surface area analysis to be 17. 3084 ± 0. 0804 m 2. g- 1, and the density 4, 61 g. cm- 3. Residual glycerin and biodiesel were also observed in the recovered catalysts. Optimal yields above 95 % were measured for both <b>methylic</b> and ethylic routes.

40|$|Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) {{process is}} one of the most {{efficient}} solution for producing hydrogen from biomass renewable feedstocks, such as polyalcohols. [1] Generally the reaction is catalyzed by supported platinoid metals and among these platinum has been recognized as the most active and selective toward the production of hydrogen. However, due to its really high complexity, the reaction mechanism is today poorly understood. DFT methods can be useful for understanding the APR catalytic mechanism at atomistic level. A detailed mechanistic study was carried out using a Pt 30 cluster for the modelization of the catalyst and 1, 2 propanediol (1, 2 PDO) as a model feedstock for the APR. Even for this simple molecule five chemically different hydrogen atoms can be recognized which lead to five different reaction paths. The activation energy required for the <b>methylic</b> C-H bond cleavage is approximately 40 kJ mol- 1 higher than the HOCH-H and HOC-H bond breakings. This effect arises directly from the presence of the OH group that reasonably enhances the possibility of the C-H bond to break. The key step of the reaction seems to be the formation of the unsaturated 1, 2 propenediole species that, if coordinated to the catalyst surface, can be reformed through a C-C bond cleavage or can be easily converted to ketonic species, which are experimentally found as byproducts. [2] The C-C bond cleavage is the rate determing step requiring 95. 7 kJ mol- 1...|$|E

ABSTRACT Evaluation of alcoholic attractants in a handmade trap {{for monitoring}} {{and control of the}} coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) This assay was based on the need of developing strategies to control the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) affordable by farmers. In the locality of Caspo, Lara State, Venezuela, the capture of adults of the insect using handmade traps constructed with soft drink disposable plastic bottles was evaluated in a completely randomized test with four repetitions and the following eight attractants: mix of <b>methylic</b> (M) and ethylic (E) alcohols at 1 : 1 ratio; mix of M and E at 3 : 1; mix of M, E and coffee powder at 1 : 1 : 1; isopropilic alcohol (I); mix of M, E and I at 1 : 1 : 1; Agave cocuy liquor; sugar cane liquor; and coffee pulp vinegar. The greater captures of adults occurred in the treatments that included mixes of methyl and ethyl alcohol, but lacking isopropilic alcohol with averages above 400 adults/trap/week, being significantly higher than the rest of treatments. A second assay established with those three treatments to determine the best height to position the traps in the coffee plantation did not show differences between the two evaluated heights of 0. 2 and 1. 0 m. The use of these traps using attractants containing mixes of <b>methylic</b> and ethylic alcohols placed between 0. 2 and 1. 0 m may be an option for controlling the coffee berry borer at high infested plantations...|$|E

Piatã, preconizados como eficientes na superação da dormência física das mesmas, na redução do inóculo de carvão (Ustilago operta). Amostras de sementes foram expostas ao ácido sulfúrico por tempo variando de 0 a 10 min, ou imersas em água à temperatura variável (27 a 60 ºC) por 5 ou 10 min. Avaliaram-se os efeitos dos tratamentos no número de teliósporos de U. operta remanescentes e na freqüência de germinação das sementes tratadas. À medida que se prolongou a escarificação química das sementes se evidenciou decréscimo do inóculo de carvão. Menor número de teliósporos foi observado nas sementes submetidas à quimioterapia por 10 min. Em geral, a exposição das sementes ao H 2 SO 4 não levou ao decréscimo da capacidade germinativa das mesmas. Os resultados da termoterapia não foram tão evidentes como os observados para a quimioterapia, sejam na redução do número de teliósporos ou na superação da dormência. É provável que o tempo de exposição das sementes não tenha sido o suficiente. Paralelamente, verificou-se a eficiência da aplicação de fungicidas na parte aérea das plantas no controle da incidência do carvão. Foram testados os fungicidas: 1 - tiofanato metílico + chlorothalonil; 2 - mancozeb; 3 - tebuconazole; 4 - triadimenol; 5 - {{azoxystrobin}} + cyproconazole; 6 - pyraclostrobin + epoxyconazole; 7 - trifloxystrobin + cyproconazole; 8 - carboxin + thiram; 9 - tiofanato metílico + flutriafol; 10 - carbendazin, e 11 - difenoconazole. Mesmo com a ocorrência de baixa incidência de carvão na área experimental (máximo de 15 %), observaram-se diferenças entre os fungicidas quanto ao controle da doença. O fungicida tebuconazole e as formulações pyraclostrobin + epoxyconazole e trifloxystrobin + cyproconazole foram os mais promissores. This work {{investigated the}} potentials of the thermal and chemical treatments in seeds of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã, {{which have been}} described as efficient strategies to overcome the physical dormancy of seeds, in the reduction of smut (Ustilago operta). Samples of seeds were immersed in sulfuric acid for 0 to 10 min, or in hot water (27 to 60 ºC) for 5 or 10 min. The effects of the treatments in the number of remaining teliospores of U. operta and in the germination of treated seed have been evaluated. A decrease of inoculum was observed as the time of chemical scarification of seeds was increased. The reduction on the number of teliospores was superior with 10 min of chemotherapy. In general, the exposition to H 2 SO 4 did not result in a decrease of the germinative power of the seeds. The results of the thermotherapy were not as evident as those observed for the chemotherapy. Reductions on the number of teliospores or on the overcoming of the physical dormancy were less apparent, maybe, because the seeds were not immersed in hot water during enough time. In parallel, the efficiency of the application of fungicides on the aerial part of the plants for the control of the smut incidence was verified. The fungicides tested were as follow: 1 - <b>methylic</b> tiofanato + chlorothalonil; 2 - mancozeb; 3 - tebuconazole; 4 - triadimenol; 5 - azoxystrobin + cyproconazole; 6 - pyraclostrobin + epoxyconazole; 7 - trifloxystrobin + cyproconazole; 8 - carboxin + thiram; 9 - <b>methylic</b> tiofanato + flutriafol; 10 - carbendazin, and 11 - difenoconazole.

Na detecção de F. graminearum em sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 23 foram utilizados os seguintes métodos: meio semi-seletivo (MSS); MSS + 2, 4 - D (0, 02 %); MSS + KCl (- 0, 8 MPa); papel de filtro (PF) com e sem o congelamento das sementes; PF + 2, 4  D (0, 02 %); restritores hídricos (KCl, NaCl, manitol e sacarose) nos potenciais osmóticos de  0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 e  1, 0 MPa. A maior incidência do patógeno foi observada com a utilização de MSS + 2, 4  D e a menor percentagem de sementes germinadas foi observada com o uso de PF com congelamento. A germinação de 30 diferentes genótipos de trigo foi significativamente influenciada pela quantidade de sementes mortas com a presença de F. graminearum, contudo não foi encontrada correlação entre a incidência do patógeno e a germinação das sementes. Também foi constatado que o fungo não afeta a emergência das plântulas, contudo verificou-se que a sua taxa de transmissão para diferentes partes da plântula (raiz, colo e haste) é variável de acordo com a com o genótipo infectado. O inóculo da semente pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de epidemias no campo. Verificou-se que maiores doses de N promovem o aumento da incidência do patógeno nas sementes, enquanto que a aplicação da mistura de fungicidas promove a redução. Não houve diferenças significativas entre as cultivares IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 na incidência do patógeno. No tratamento químico de sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 18 Terena, as menores incidências do fungo foram observadas empregando-se os fungicidas tiofanato metílico e tebuconazole. Não houve influência dos fungicidas tanto na germinação quanto na emergência e velocidade de emergência de plântulas.

The highest incidence of the pathogen was observed with the use of MSS + 2, 4 - D and the lowest percentage of germinated seeds was observed with the use deep freezing blotter method of PF with freezing. The germination of 30 different wheat genotypes was significantly influenced by the quantity of dead seeds with the presence of F. graminearum. However, correlation between the incidence of the pathogen and the germination of the seeds was not found. It was found that the fungus does not affect the emergence of seedlings, however it was verified that its rate of transmission for different parts of seedling is variable in accordance with the infected genotype. It was also verified that higher doses of N promote the increase of the incidence of the pathogen in the seeds, and that the application of the mixture of fungicides promotes the reduction. There was no effect of cultivars IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 on the incidence of pathogen. Regarding the chemical treatment of wheat seeds of cultivar BR 18 Terena, the lowest incidences of the fungus were observed using the fungicides <b>methylic</b> tiophanate and tebuconazole. There was no effect of fungicides both on the germination and on the seedlings emergence and emergence velocity. On the other hand, fungicides such as the captan, triticonazole, tebuconazole and triadimenol affected the height of plântulas negatively, interfering with their performance...|$|E
40|$|O Amarelo ou Murcha de Fusarium, causado por Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi vem assumindo grande importância na cultura do gengibre devido à ausência de métodos eficientes de controle. Com os objetivos de testar a termoterapia associada ao tratamento químico e biológico para a obtenção de rizomas-semente sadios e avaliar a indução de supressividade do solo a Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi com a incorporação de casca de camarão, seis ensaios foram conduzidos. Para o tratamento térmico, foram utilizados rizomas infectados, com aproximadamente 5 cm de comprimento. As relações tempo-temperatura utilizadas foram: 45 °C por zero, 60, 120 e 180 minutos e 50 °C por zero, dez e 20 minutos (ensaio 1 e campo); 50 °C por zero, 30 e 60 minutos e 55 °C por zero, 10 e 20 minutos (ensaio 2); 50, 55 e 60 ºC por zero, 10 e 20 min (ensaio 3). As caldas para tratamento térmico foram constituídas por água, solução de tiofanato metílico e caldo fermentado por Bacillus subtilis. No experimento em laboratório, os rizomas foram inoculados artificialmente. Após uma semana, receberam o tratamento térmico a 45 º C por 60, 120 e 180 minutos e a 50 ºC e 55 ºC por 10 e 20 minutos. Após a termoterapia, segmentos de rizoma foram plaqueados, sendo avaliados pela contagem dos segmentos que apresentavam o crescimento do patógeno. Na coleta, foram avaliadas altura, peso da matéria fresca da parte aérea e produção, e realizado o plaqueamento da parte aérea, raiz e rizoma. Para verificar a possibilidade do uso de casca de camarão, o solo foi infestado com o isolado patogênico. Após uma semana, houve a incorporação da casca de camarão ao solo nas concentrações de 0; 2, 5; 5; 7, 5; 10; 15 e 20 % (v/v). A população de Fusarium do solo e a comunidade de actinomicetos foram avaliadas semanalmente por diluição em série e plaqueamento. Após oito semanas da incorporação, foi realizado o plantio de um rizoma-semente de gengibre por vaso. Na coleta, a avaliação foi realizada da mesma maneira que para termoterapia. Através de todos os resultados obtidos nos cinco ensaios de termoterapia, verificouse a possibilidade de utilização da técnica com sucesso no auxílio ao controle da doença. As melhores combinações tempo/temperatura foram a 45 ºC pelo tempo de 120 minutos ou a 55 ºC por 20 minutos em todas as caldas. No teste com o uso da casca de camarão, houve uma diminuição da população de Fusarium e aumento da comunidade de actinomicetos nos solos que receberam a incorporação de casca. A adição de casca de camarão ao solo permite o plantio do gengibre em locais onde o patógeno esteja presente. Yellow or Fusarium Wilt, caused for Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi comes {{assuming}} {{great importance}} {{in the culture of}} the ginger due to absence of efficient methods of control. With the objectives to test the thermotherapy associated with the chemical and biological treatment for the healthy attainment of ginger-seed and to evaluate the induction of soil suppressiveness to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi with the incorporation of shrimp peel, six experiments had been lead. For the thermal treatment, infested rhizome had been used, with approximately 5 cm of length. The used relations time-temperature had been: 45 °C for zero, 60, 120 and 180 minutes and 50 °C for zero, ten and 20 minutes (experiment 1 and field); 50 °C for zero, 30 and 60 minutes and 55 °C for zero, 10 and 20 minutes (experiment 2); 50, 55 and 60 ºC for zero, 10 and 20 min (experiment 3). Solutions for thermal treatment had been constituted by water, solution of thiophanate <b>methylic</b> and broth leavend for Bacillus subtilis. In the experiment in laboratory, rhizomes had been inoculated artificially. After one week, they had received the thermal treatment 45 º C for 60, 120 and 180 minutes and 50 ºC and 55 ºC for 10 and 20 minutes. After the thermal treatment, segments of rhizomes had been placed in plates, being evaluated for the counting of the segments that presented the growth of the pathogen. In the collection, height, weight of the aerial part and production had been evaluated, and carried through plating of the aerial part, root and rhizome. To verify the possibility of the use of shrimp peel, the soil was infested with isolated the pathogenic one. After one week, had the incorporation of the peel of shrimp to the soil in the concentrations of 0; 2, 5; 5; 7, 5; 10; 15 and 20 % (v/v). The population of Fusarium of the soil and the community of actinomycetes had been evaluated weekly by dilution in series and placed in plates. After eight weeks of the incorporation, the plantation of one rizome-seed of ginger for vase was carried through. In the collection, the evaluation was carried through {{in the same way that}} for thermotherapy. Through all the results gotten in the five experiments of thermotherapy, it was verified successfully possibility of use of the technique in the aid to the control of the illness. The best combinations time/temperature had been 45 ºC for the time of 120 minutes or 55 ºC per 20 minutes in all solutions. In the test with the use of the shrimp peel, it had a reduction of the population of Fusarium and increase of the community of actinomycetes in the soil that had received the incorporation from peel. The addition of peel of shrimp to the soil allows the plantation of the ginger in places where the pathogen is present...|$|E
