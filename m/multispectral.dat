5|$|In 1968 and 1969, NASA {{conducted}} {{studies with}} <b>multispectral</b> scanners. In {{that same time}} period, Hughes entered into a contract with NASA to complete the <b>multispectral</b> scanner (MSS) for Landsat 1.|$|E
5|$|Landsat 1 had two {{sensors to}} achieve its primary objectives: the return beam vidicon (RBV) and the <b>multispectral</b> scanner (MSS).|$|E
5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre <b>multispectral</b> (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre <b>multispectral</b> (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|From launch until 1974, Landsat 1 {{transmitted}} over 100,000 images, which covered {{more than}} 75% of the Earth's surface. The {{majority of these}} images were taken with the <b>multispectral</b> scanner. On 05 August 1972 the return beam vidicon failed after taking only 1690 images.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instrument}} carried {{aboard the}} station was the BST-1M <b>multispectral</b> telescope, which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared, ultraviolet and submillimetre spectra using a 1.5metre-diameter mirror which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around 269°C. The telescope could be operated only when Salyut 6 was on the night side of the Earth, and had its cover closed {{for the rest of}} the time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its Hiten spacecraft. The spacecraft released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA spacecraft Clementine to lunar orbit. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global <b>multispectral</b> images of the lunar surface. This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, {{which is likely to}} have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M <b>multispectral</b> camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{excitation}} with <b>multispectral</b> return {{analysis is}} a promising chemical and possibly biological analysis method.|$|E
25|$|The AN/PSQ-20, {{manufactured}} by ITT (also {{known as the}} Enhanced Night Vision Goggle, ENVG), seeks to combine thermal imaging with image intensification, as does the Northrop Grumman Fused <b>Multispectral</b> Weapon Sight.|$|E
25|$|Where an IMINT sensor {{would take}} a picture that fills a frame, the Spectroscopic MASINT sensor gives a list, by coordinate, of {{wavelengths}} and energy. <b>Multispectral</b> IMINT is likely to discriminate more wavelengths, especially if it extends into the IR or UV, than a human being, even with an excellent color sense, could discriminate.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Ramon was {{selected}} as a Payload Specialist. He was designated to train as prime for a space shuttle mission with a payload that included a <b>multispectral</b> camera for recording desert aerosol (dust). In July 1998, he reported for training at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, where he trained until 2003. He flew aboard STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space.|$|E
25|$|Advances in <b>multispectral</b> {{photography}} {{have enabled}} imaging specialists at the British Library led by Christina Duffy to scan and upload images of previously illegible Anglo-Saxon manuscripts damaged in the fire. Images will {{form part of}} Fragmentarium (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments), an international collaboration of libraries and research institutions to catalogue and collate vulnerable manuscript fragments, making them available for research under a Creative Commons public domain license.|$|E
25|$|Orbital Imaging spacecrafts are {{designed}} to provide commercial Earth imaging services. The OrbView series of spacecraft {{paved the way for}} today’s space-based Earth imaging industry. In addition to the OrbView satellites the company also built the GeoEye-1 high resolution imaging satellite. Orbital LEOStar-2 and -3 spacecraft platforms {{are designed}} to support a variety of <b>multispectral,</b> visible and thermal imaging payloads. A list of commercial imaging satellites built by Orbital is provided next.|$|E
25|$|Kitsat-3 was a South Korean {{remote sensing}} {{minisatellite}} which carried MEIS (<b>Multispectral</b> Earth Imaging System) and SENSE (Space ENvironment Scientific Experiment) instruments to Low Earth orbit. Launched on 26 May 1999 by Indian space agency ISRO, on orbit the satellite was renamed to Uribyol 3. Manufactured by KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC), Kitsat-3 was developed with experience from Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 (no heritage to the Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 bus) {{and was the}} first independently designed South Korean satellite.|$|E
25|$|The midband {{region of}} its eye {{is made up}} of six rows of {{specialised}} ommatidia—a cluster of photoreceptor cells. Four rows carry up to 16 different photoreceptor pigments: 12 for colour sensitivity, others for colour filtering. The vision of the mantis shrimp can perceive both polarised light and <b>multispectral</b> images. Their eyes (mounted on mobile stalks and capable of moving independently of each other) are similarly variably coloured and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Pit vipers, pythons {{and some}} boas have organs {{that allow them}} to detect {{infrared}} light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The common vampire bat may also have an infrared sensor on its nose. It has been found that birds and some other animals are tetrachromats and have the ability to see in the ultraviolet down to 300 nanometers. Bees and dragonflies are also able to see in the ultraviolet. Mantis shrimps can perceive both polarized light and <b>multispectral</b> images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.|$|E
25|$|Ilan Ramon was Israel's first astronaut. Ramon was {{the space}} shuttle payload {{specialist}} on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle Columbia, in which he and the six other crew members {{were killed in a}} re-entry accident over the southern United States. Ramon had been selected as a payload specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003. Among other experiments, Ramon was responsible for the MEIDEX project in which he was required to take pictures of atmospheric aerosol (dust) in the Mediterranean area using a <b>multispectral</b> camera designed to provide scientific information about atmospheric aerosols and the influence of global changes on the climate, and data for the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. Researchers from Tel Aviv University (TAU) were responsible for the scientific aspect of the experiment. The TAU team also worked with a US company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, to construct and test special flight instruments for the project.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial <b>multispectral</b> videography has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of riparian vegetation on stream banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. In a second study of riparian vegetation based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase riparian vegetation given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{separation}} from the launch vehicle, the two solar arrays on board the Cartosat-2D satellite were automatically deployed. Afterwards, ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru took [...] control of the satellite. [...] "In the coming days, the satellite {{will be brought to}} its final operational configuration following which it will begin to provide remote sensing services using its panchromatic (black and white) and <b>multispectral</b> (colour) cameras," [...] an ISRO statement read. The mission lasted 29 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Salyut 6 ( [...] ; lit.Salute 6), DOS-5, was a Soviet orbital space station, {{the eighth}} flown {{as part of}} the Salyut programme. Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station {{was the first of the}} 'second-generation' type of space station. Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary {{advances}} over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design. These included the addition of a second docking port, a new main propulsion system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M <b>multispectral</b> telescope. The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time. The early Salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage (aside from the limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their Soyuz spacecraft), nor could the propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply. Consequently, once the consumables launched with the station were used up, its mission had to be concluded and as a result, manned missions had a maximum duration of three months. Progress spacecraft could now bring fresh supplies and propellant and also be used to dispose of waste, which was then destroyed once the spacecraft was deorbited.|$|E
2500|$|The Ralph telescope, [...] in aperture, {{is one of}} two {{photographic}} {{instruments that}} make up New Horizons Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI), with the other being the Alice instrument. Ralph has two separate channels: MVIC (<b>Multispectral</b> Visible Imaging Camera), a visible-light CCD imager with broadband and color channels; and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), a near-infrared imaging spectrometer. LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft. Ralph was named after Alice's husband on The Honeymooners, and was designed after Alice.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperspectral, {{as opposed}} to <b>multispectral,</b> {{processing}} gives the potential of improved spectral signature measurement from airborne and spaceborne sensor platforms. Sensors on these platforms, however, must compensate for atmospheric effects. Such compensation is easiest with high contrast targets sensed through well-behaved atmosphere with even, reliable illumination, the real world will not always be so cooperative. [...] For more complicated situations, one can not simply compensate for the atmospheric and illumination conditions by taking them out. The Invariant Algorithm for target detection was designed to find many possible combinations of these conditions for the image.|$|E
2500|$|CRISM {{measures}} {{visible and}} infrared electromagnetic radiation from 370 to 3920 nanometers in 6.55 nanometer increments. [...] The instrument has two modes, a <b>multispectral</b> untargeted mode and a hyperspectral targeted mode. [...] In the untargeted mode, CRISM reconnoiters Mars, recording approximately 50 of its 544 measurable wavelengths at {{a resolution of}} 100 to 200 meters per pixel. [...] In this mode CRISM will map half of Mars {{within a few months}} after aerobraking and most of the planet after one year. [...] The objective of this mode is to identify new scientifically interesting locations that could be further investigated. In targeted mode, the spectrometer measures energy in all 544 wavelengths. [...] When the MRO spacecraft is at an altitude of 300km, CRISM detects a narrow but long strip on the Martian surface about 18 kilometers across and 10,800 kilometers long. [...] The instrument sweeps this strip across the surface as MRO orbits Mars to image the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The Rivet Chip and Rivet Slice {{aircraft}} {{have been}} used by NASA in support of various research programs. NASA first provided funding to modify and operate RB-57F 63-13501 to support the Earth Resources Satellite Program, with modifications taking place at Fort Worth between 26 September 1968 and 14 July 1969 as Project Rivet Rap. Flying as NASA 925 and known as [...] "ESA (Earth Survey Aircraft) No. 3", the WB-57F was used as a flying testbed for the evaluation of <b>multispectral</b> sensors in a [...] "near-space" [...] environment to collect data to be correlated with similar data collected at low altitude and on the ground. The Air Force contracted with NASA to provide the aircraft on the condition that its sensor package be easily removed to reconfigure the aircraft quickly for its national security mission if necessary. The Rivet Rap was therefore modified to carry aerodynamically faired, plug-in pallets developed by General Dynamics to house both NASA and Air Force primary mission equipment. These pallets fit into the bomb bay and connected with existing electrical and cooling outlets, and had removable operating consoles that could be fitted into the back seat station in the cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Multispectral</b> imaging {{deals with}} several images at {{discrete}} and somewhat narrow bands. Being [...] "discrete and somewhat narrow" [...] is what distinguishes <b>multispectral</b> imaging in the visible wavelength from color photography. A <b>multispectral</b> sensor may have many bands covering the spectrum from the {{visible to the}} longwave infrared. <b>Multispectral</b> images do not produce the [...] "spectrum" [...] of an object. Landsat {{is an excellent example}} of <b>multispectral</b> imaging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multispectral</b> {{remote sensing}} is the {{collection}} and analysis of reflected, emitted, or back-scattered energy from an object or an area of interest in multiple bands of regions {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} (Jensen, 2005). Subcategories of <b>multispectral</b> remote sensing include hyperspectral, in which hundreds of bands are collected and analyzed, and ultraspectral remote sensing where many hundreds of bands are used (Logicon, 1997). The main purpose of <b>multispectral</b> imaging is the potential to classify the image using <b>multispectral</b> classification. This is a much faster method of image analysis than is possible by human interpretation.|$|E
