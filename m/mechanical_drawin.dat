A possibility {{of the existence of}} a controllable factor would justify a search in order to provide informa-tion for high choo 1 counselors. A knowledge of the existence of a recorded measurable factor would be of value to freshmen advisors within a college school of engineering. Those faotors whose relationship to performance in engineerinz drawing were considered in this study are as follow 5 : 1. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>drawin</b> taken in high school. 2.

The methodology of the research was quasi experiment which conducted pretest and posttest control group design. Population is all of mechanical engineering department students for academic year 2013 / 2014 at 10 th semester, consisted of 123 persons. Sampling technique conducted was cluster sampling. According to the cluster class, it could be determined that X TP 1 was categorized as control class and X TP 2 was categorized as experiment class. The data collection was conducted by test and documentation. Analysis technique was descriptive-quantitative. The hypothesis was examined by t-test. The results of the research show the influence of inquiry learning to the control class which was shown by its posttest mean deviation as high as 21, 78 and of project based learning to the experiment class which was shown by pretest and posttest mean deviation as high as 27, 42.
