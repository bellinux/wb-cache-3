2500|$|Korea is {{believed}} to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China. Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor Dangun, though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514AD. Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries. As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well. China and Korea sent [...] "medical missionaries" [...] that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system. Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State <b>Medical</b> <b>Administration</b> System.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to: (1) {{identify}} the sources of job-related stress which create excessive pressures for the directors and faculty of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration</b> and <b>medical</b> record technology programs; (2) identify the strategies that the directors and faculty of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration</b> and <b>medical</b> record technology programs find most helpful in coping with stress; (3) determine the relationship among demographic variables and job-related stressors as perceived by the directors and faculty of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration</b> and <b>medical</b> record technology programs; and (4) determine the difference among the means of five stress factors as perceived by the directors of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration,</b> faculty of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration,</b> directors of <b>medical</b> record technology and faculty of medical record technology programs. Questionnaires were mailed to 403 respondents. The response rate was 81. 3 %. Within the limitations of this study, the results revealed that "Having insufficient time to keep abreast of current developments in my field"was the highest stressor. The top stress coping strategy was "Social interaction. " The relationship between demographic variables and five stress factors of reward and recognition, time constraint, departmental influence, professional identity and student interaction revealed a positive correlation between degree and professional identity factor, and a negative correlation between degree and student interaction factor. The results also indicated a positive correlation between type of program and the factors-time constraint, professional identity and student interaction; a positive correlation between academic rank and the factors [...] time constraint and student interaction; a positive correlation between teaching responsibilities and time constraint factor; and a positive correlation between marital status and professional identity factor. The directors and faculty of <b>medical</b> record <b>administration</b> perception of time constraint and professional identity factors differed from that of the directors and faculty of medical record technology programs...|$|R
