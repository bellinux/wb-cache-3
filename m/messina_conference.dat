40|$|In the {{framework}} of a recently developed alpha-cluster model a nucleus is represented as a core (alpha-cluster liquid drop with dissolved excess neutron pairs in it) and a nuclear molecule on its surface. From analysis of experimental nuclear binding energies one can find the number of alpha-clusters in the molecule and calculate the nuclear charge radii. It was shown that for isotopes of one Z with growing A the number of alpha-clusters in the molecule decreases to three, which corresponds to the nucleus 12 C for even Z and 15 N for odd Z, and the specific density of the core binding energy ρ grows and reaches its saturation value. In this paper it is shown that the value ρ= 2. 55 MeV/fm^ 3 explains the particular number of excess neutrons in stable nuclei.

50|$|The Spaak Committee was an Intergovernmental Committee {{set up by}} the Foreign Ministers of the six Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) as {{a result}} of the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference</b> of 1955. The Spaak Committee started its work on 9 July 1955 and ended on 20 April 1956, when the Heads of Delegation of the six Member States of the ECSC {{approved}} the Spaak report. The committee worked on two main topics, one was the creation of a general common market and the other one was the establishment of a European Community for the peaceful use of atomic energy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference</b> of European leaders {{appointed}} him {{as chairman of}} a preparatory committee (Spaak Committee) charged with the preparation of {{a report on the}} creation of a common European market. The so-called [...] "Spaak Report [...] " [...] formed the cornerstone of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956 and led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaties of Rome establishing a European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). Paul-Henri Spaak signed the treaty for Belgium, together with Jean Charles Snoy et d'Oppuers. His role {{in the creation of the}} EEC earned Spaak a place among the Founding fathers of the European Union.|$|E
5000|$|Consequently, and {{contrary}} to many subsequent incorrect reports, the UK was not represented at the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference</b> in June 1955. At that meeting the Benelux members of the ECSC represented at Foreign Minister level argued that: [...] "it is necessary {{to work for the}} establishment of a united Europe by the development of common institutions, the gradual fusion of national economies, the creation of a common market and the gradual harmonisation of … social policies." [...] At the end of the conference a committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the Belgian Foreign Minister Henri Spaak, to further these studies. The UK government was invited to join in the discussions but, given that it was not looking for a positive outcome, appointed as their representative not a politician, but a trade economist and civil servant, Russell Bretherton.|$|E

50|$|In 1955 {{the foreign}} {{ministers of the}} European Coal and Steel Community met at the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference,</b> among other things to {{nominate}} {{a member of the}} High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community and to appoint its new president and vice-presidents for the period ending 10 February 1957. The conference, which was held from 1 June to 3 June 1955 in the Italian city of Messina, Sicily, would lead to the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.Shortly before the conference, Adenauer had given up his double post as Foreign Minister and, since Brentano had not yet been sworn in, Hallstein led the German delegation.The agenda included discussion of an action programme to relaunch European integration following the collapse, in August 1954, of the plans to create a European Political Community and a European Defence Community, when France failed to ratify the treaty.|$|E
50|$|The French National Assembly's refusal on 30 August 1954 {{to ratify}} the treaty {{establishing}} the European Defence Community, seemed initially to block the process of integration. However, the danger that after {{the failure of the}} EDC, France and Germany would lead their own policy caused the Benelux countries to retake the initiative in the European project. At the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference</b> (1-3 June 1955) submitted a memorandum in which they proposed a common market. Luxembourg played only a minor role in the Messina initiative. Bech was worried about the extension of supranationality, and was wary of the prospect of totally free circulation of goods and persons. The memorandum was mostly the work of his Belgian and Dutch colleagues, Paul-Henri Spaak and Johan Willem Beyen. At the negotiations of Val Duchesse, which prepared the path for the Treaty of Rome, the Luxembourgish government sent a small delegation led by the former minister Lambert Schaus.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the energy crises, the Common Assembly {{proposed}} extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other sources of energy. However, Monnet desired a separate Community to cover nuclear power, and Louis Armand was put in charge of a study into the prospects of nuclear energy use in Europe. The report concluded that further nuclear development was needed, in order to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal deposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. The Benelux states and West Germany were also keen on creating a general common market; however, this was opposed by France owing to its protectionist policy, and Monnet thought it too large and difficult a task. In the end, Monnet proposed creating both as separate Communities to attempt to satisfy all interests. As {{a result of}} the <b>Messina</b> <b>Conference</b> of 1955, Paul-Henri Spaak was appointed as chairman of a preparatory committee, the Spaak Committee, charged with the preparation of a report on the creation of a common European market.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will {{describe}} some results {{that have been}} recently obtained {{in the study of}} random Euclidean matrices, i. e. matrices that are functions of random points in Euclidean space. In the case of translation invariant matrices one generically finds a phase transition between a phonon phase and a saddle phase. If we apply these considerations {{to the study of the}} Hessian of the Hamiltonian of the particles of a fluid, we find that this phonon-saddle transition corresponds to the dynamical phase transition in glasses, that has been studied in the framework of the mode coupling approximation. The Boson peak observed in glasses at low temperature is a remanent of this transition. Comment: proceeding of the <b>Messina</b> <b>conference</b> in honour of Gene Stanley, Physica A in pres...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of the Treasury in the {{formulation}} and implementation of Britain's European policy in the period between the <b>Messina</b> <b>conference</b> and the failure of the first membership bid. It points to a strong contrast between the 1955 - 59 period, during which the Treasury, aided and abetted by the Board of Trade, was the dominant force in British European policy, and the early 1960 s when the Cabinet and Foreign Offices successfully challenged for the position as lead department in this policy area. The final section of the article seeks to explain the disappearance of Treasury pre-eminence, suggesting that factors ranging from the personality of the Chancellor to the subject and context of negotiations with Western European interlocutors help explain why the Treasury appeared a waning force in the making of Britain's policy towards the EEC...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is the handout that accompanied a {{paper presented at}} the December 2001 <b>Messina</b> <b>conference</b> on Horizons in Complex Systems. Currently it presents the basic concepts only. It proposes that one key idea constitutes the key to understanding the brain, namely the fact that abstractions are possible. The particular abstractions relevant to particular aspects of nature define the designs that are capable of handling these aspects of nature. The task of explaining the brain thus reduces to an investigation of the abstractions, the relevant interrelationships, and the corresponding design components. 1 BRAIN FUNCTIONING This paper is concerned with understanding how the highly complex structure that is the human brain is able to accomplish advanced skills such as using language. Of the existing approaches to understanding nervous system functioning, one important one is that of experimental studies of brain and behaviour, and another that based upon computational models of neural networks (e. g. Elman et al 1996). Neither offers insights into the subtleties of skills such as language, the former because neural circuitr...|$|E
