50|$|BÃ¼ro BDP is what BDP call a {{multidisciplinary}} hybrid: office, creative agency, exhibition space, book showroom, archive for artists books and reading room, exploring the radical potentialities of an expanded notion of The Book {{in the contemporary}} age. Taking its cue from the initial impulse of Broken Dimanche Press - exploring the border between literature and contemporary art practice - {{the focus is on}} translation, editions, print solutions and the physical meeting of the core agents in book production: writers, artist, designers, editors, printers, distributors, booksellers and readers. It is furnished with a bespoke <b>modular</b> <b>desk</b> and display unit created by Canadian designer Leanne MacKay and over 50m2 of gallery and office space. It is located in Rixdorf, in Berlin's Neukoelln district.|$|E
50|$|When closed, the {{secretary}} desk {{looks like a}} cross between a commode-dresser, a slant top desk and a book case. The secretary {{is one of the most}} common antique desk forms and has been endlessly reproduced and copied for home use in the last hundred years. Among home desk forms, it is the tallest, biggest and heaviest, excluding wall units and <b>modular</b> <b>desks</b> which typically can be disassembled for moving, or some of the biggest of the armoire desks, which are usually delivered unassembled.|$|R
50|$|Another big {{expansion}} {{occurred after}} the Second World War with {{the spread of}} photocopying. Paperwork further {{increased the number of}} desk workers, whose work surfaces diminished in size as office rents rose, and the paper itself was moved more and more directly to filing cabinets or sent to specialized records management centers, or transformed into microfilm, or both. <b>Modular</b> <b>desks</b> seating several co-workers close by became common. Even executive or management desks became mass-produced, built of cheap plywood or fiberboard covered with wood finish, as the number of people managing the white collar workers became even greater.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the USM Haller system is a <b>modular</b> {{freestanding}} <b>desk</b> and storage solution for the office or home. The tables are offered in standard shapes, sizes and finishes that can be accessorized with equipment for modern technology including: swing arms for telephones, monitors and computers, paper, and wire management organizers.|$|R
