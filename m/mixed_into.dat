5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost all white as the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they would wait in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E

40|$|SEM {{observations}} {{have shown}} that irradiation induced interaction of the aluminum cladding with uranium silicide reactor fuels strongly affects both fission gas and fuel swelling behaviors during fuel burn-up. The authors have used ion beam mixing, by 1. 5 MeV Kr, to study this phenomena. RBS and the {sup 27 }Al(p, {gamma}) {sup 28 }Si resonance nuclear reaction were used to measure radiation induced <b>mixing</b> of Al <b>into</b> U{sub 3 }Si and U{sub 3 }Si{sub 2 } after irradiation at 300 C. Initially U <b>mixes</b> <b>into</b> the Al layer and Al <b>mixes</b> <b>into</b> the U{sub 3 }Si. At a low dose, the Al layer is converted into UAl{sub 4 } type compound while near the interface the phase U(Al{sub. 93 }Si{sub. 07 }) {sub 3 } grows. Under irradiation, Al diffuses out of the UAl{sub 4 } surface layer, and the lower density ternary, which is stable under irradiation, is the final product. Al <b>mixing</b> <b>into</b> U{sub 3 }Si{sub 2 } is slower than in U{sub 3 }Si, but after high dose irradiation the Al concentration extends much farther into the bulk. In both systems Al mixing and diffusion is controlled by phase formation and growth. The Al <b>mixing</b> rates <b>into</b> the two alloys are {{similar to that of}} Al into pure uranium where similar aluminide phases are formed...|$|R

5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces were thrown out. For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: each element of a track was recorded separately, then <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which he knew was an important task {{as it would have}} an international audience. He estimated that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and <b>mixed</b> <b>into</b> hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E
