40|$|To {{develop a}} <b>menu</b> and <b>resource</b> to {{illustrate}} to consumers and health professionals what a healthy balanced diet looks like {{over the course}} of a week. Development and analysis of an illustrative 7 d ‘eatwell week’ menu to meet current UK recommendations for nutrients with a Dietary Reference Value, with a daily energy base of 8368 kJ (2000 kcal). Foods were selected using market research data on meals and snacks commonly consumed by UK adults. Analysis used the food composition data set from year 1 (2008) of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey rolling programme. The eatwell week menu was developed using an iterative process of nutritional analysis with adjustments made to portion sizes and the inclusion/exclusion of foods in order to achieve the target macronutrient composition. Three main meals and two snacks were presented as interchangeable within the weekdays and two weekend days to achieve adult food and nutrient recommendations. Main meals were based on potatoes, rice or pasta with fish (two meals; one oily), red meat (two meals), poultry or vegetarian accompaniments. The 5 -a-day target for fruit and vegetables (range 5 – 6 · 7 portions) was achieved daily. Mean salt content was below recommended maximum levels (&# 60; 6 g/d). All key macro- and micronutrient values were achieved. Affordable foods, and those widely consumed by British adults, can be incorporated within a 7 d healthy balanced menu. Future research should investigate the effect of using the eatwell week on adults’ dietary habits and health-related outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the current situation and projections for energy access in Africa. The paper also presents several sets of ambitious energy access targets as agreed by the regional groupings within the region. The paper argues that achieving between 50 % and 100 % access to modern energy services by 2030 in Africa will require more effective mobilization and use of both domestic and external funding, and {{the development and implementation of}} innovative policy frameworks. The paper suggests that greater emphasis will need to be placed on productive uses of energy and energy for income generation in order to break the vicious circle of low incomes leading to poor access to modern energy services, which in turn puts severe limitations on the ability to generate higher incomes. The paper further suggests that if anything near the ambitious targets set by African organisations are to be achieved then it will be advisable to tap into the full <b>menu</b> of energy <b>resource</b> and technology options, and there will be the need for significant increases in the numbers of various actors involved together with more effective institutions in the energy sector.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This research examines learnability measures derived from the all-or-none stochastic learning model. The all-or-none model represents the paired-associate learning that occurs during the initial learning of human-computer interaction (HCI) tasks. The ability of the model to quantify interface quality was the primary focus of the research. The quantitative measure of interest was a parameter of the all-or-none model referred to as a learning rate. Model validation was investigated by comparing learning rates to two other traditional measures of interface quality, mean task completion time and mean number of errors. The HCI environment selected for study was SuperCard, a Macintosh project utility that allows a user to create various applications. Thirty-two college students who TI were experienced Macintosh users but inexperienced SuperCard users participated in the experiment. They were required to learn 16 basic SuperCard T" tasks involving windows, <b>menus,</b> and <b>resources.</b> Sample path data was collected to estimate the model learning rates. Video tapes were analyzed to collect task completion times and numbers of errors. Subjective ratings of user proficiency were also collected. The subjective ratings were originally intended to be used as another comparison measure. However, the uniform distribution of the data and model residuals made any conclusions invalid. The results of this research indicated that learning rates derived from the all-or-none model are valid indicators of interface quality. Correlations between the learning rates and the other two measures were significant. Analyses of variance were conducted for the three measures. The learning rates identified seven SuperCardl" tasks for potential reevaluation and improvement: Name Resource, Window Type, Open/Close <b>Resource,</b> Name <b>Menu,</b> Size Window, Locate Window, and Resource ID. The Size Window and Locate Window tasks were identified by the mean task completion time measure and the Size Window task was identified by the mean number of errors measure. Additionally, user type was not a significant effect for the all-or-none model. Whether a user is a frequent or occasional user was a significant effect for mean task completion time and approached significance for mean number of errors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between dietary patterns and indicators of social identity among individuals buried at the Yukisma Mound (CA-SCL- 38) during the Middle-Late Transition and Late Period (940 - 230 BP). The remains of 248 individuals and associated artifacts were recovered during excavations in 1993 and 1994 by Ohlone Families Consulting Services. This study begins by situating the Yukisma Mound {{within the context of}} California archaeology. Variables of mortuary context and artifact associations are reconciled and correlated with demographic categories. Prehistoric foodways are addressed through discussions of nutrition, menu, diet, and cuisine. Bioarchaeological evidence suggests that diets were nutritionally complete. The <b>menu</b> of food <b>resources</b> from the prehistoric Santa Clara Valley is reconstructed using paleoenvironmental data, faunal and botanical remains from archaeological contexts, artifactual evidence, and ethnohistoric reports. Stable isotope ?? 13 C and ?? 15 N values from bone collagen (n = 127) and ?? 13 C from bone apatite (n = 122) indicate a diet of terrestrial resources with some freshwater fish, waterfowl, and bay shellfish, and few marine resources. The pattern at CA-SCL- 38 is distinct from all other measured populations in the Bay Area, and is intermediate to populations in the East and South Bay Regions. To interpret cuisine at the Yukisma Mound site, dietary patterns are compared to mortuary context, artifact associations, and indicators of social identity including social age, sex and gender, disabilities, specializations, status, and population affinity. The assemblage from CA-SCL- 38 supports an interpretation of ranked social organization, inherited wealth, and flexible identity construction, but few correlations are found with diet.

40|$|Spinal Cord Injuries Australia (SCIA) {{commissioned}} the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) {{to carry out}} research about maximising life choices of people with a spinal cord injury. The research was supported by Ageing Disability and Home Care, Department of Family and Community Service NSW. This report outlines the methods, findings and implications of the research. The research involved a literature review, one-to-one interviews, roundtables and an on-line survey (Section 3). Total participants were 111, including 83 in the online survey. Hard to reach groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islanders, people living in regional locations, born overseas or from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, were well represented in the survey. Overrepresented were women, older people and people with higher levels of education (Section 4). The Personal Wellbeing Index was used to measure people’s quality of life. The scores were within the normal range for Australians, although the average score for participants was, as expected, lower than the Australian average in most cases (Section 4). The research was conducted using a number of methods including appreciative inquiry about people’s goals. The findings of the research have been analysed and organised using the social inclusion framework in order to identify whether people have the opportunity to participate fully in society and how they are able to maximise their life choices (Section 5). The data presented in this report (Section 6 and 7) are from the interviews, roundtables and on-line survey; they are qualitative (interviews, roundtables, survey) and quantitative (survey). We were able to quantify from some of the qualitative data because of the common responses. This data should be used with caution because the responses were not from a closed list of prompts. The breadth of the analysis is based on the information provided by participants and therefore may not be comprehensive across all themes of social inclusion. Access to resources to maximise opportunities and capabilities are necessary for {{people to be able to}} make life choices and experience social inclusion. Research participants said that physical and emotional wellbeing are fundamental to being able to access opportunities. Furthermore, two-thirds of participants said the role of the family in terms of emotional, physical and financial support was the most important resource in being able to achieve goals. The key implications arising from this research (Section 8) are the need to:support to maintain and improve health support participation in family and social life provide support to family and friendspromote workforce participation and trainingimprove information resourcesincrease financial securityimprove government policyincrease accessible housing, facilities and transport.  The implications are of equal importance in terms of supporting a <b>menu</b> of <b>resources</b> for people with a spinal cord injury to enable them to maximise life choices.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Document:	AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SCHOOLMAX FAMILY PORTAL 	 	Warren Wesley Watts, Doctor of Education, 2015 	 Directed By:	Margaret J. McLaughlin, Ph. D. Department of Counseling, Higher Education and Special Education 	School {{districts have}} spent {{millions}} of dollars implementing student information systems that offer family portals with web-based access to parents and students. One of the main purposes of these systems is to improve school-to-home communication. Research has shown that when school-to-home communication is implemented effectively, parent involvement improves and student achievement increases (Epstein, 2001). 	The {{purpose of the study was}} to (a) understand why parents used or refrained from using the family portal and (b) determine what barriers to use might exist. To this end, this descriptive study identified the information parent users accessed in the SchoolMAX family portal, determined how frequently parents accessed the portal, and ascertained whether parents perceived an increase in communication with their children about academic matters after they began accessing the portal. Finally, the study sought to identify whether barriers existed that prevented parents from using the family portal. 	The inquiry employed three data sources to answer the aforementioned queries. These sources included (a) a survey sent electronically to 19, 108 parents who registered online for the SchoolMAX family portal; (b) SchoolMAX portal usage data from the student information system for system usage between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015; and (c) a paper survey sent to 691 parents of students that had never used the SchoolMAX family portal in one elementary school, one middle school and one high school that were representative of other schools in the district. Survey results indicated that parents at all grade levels used the family portal. Usage data also confirmed that approximately 19 % of the students had parents who monitored their progress through the family portal. Usage data also showed that parents were monitoring approximately 25 % of students in secondary schools (6 th – 12 th grade) and 16 % of students in elementary schools. Of the wide <b>menu</b> of <b>resources</b> available through the SchoolMAX family portal, parents used three areas most frequently: attendance, daily grades, and report cards. Approximately 70 % of parents responded that their communication had improved with their children about academic matters since they started using the SchoolMAX family portal, and 90 % of parents responded that the SchoolMAX family portal was an effective or somewhat effective tool. Parents also expressed interest in the addition of additional information to the SchoolMAX family portal. Specifically, the top three additions parents wanted to see included homework assignments, high stakes test scores, and graduation requirements. Parents also reported that 92 % of them spoke to their children at least 2 to 3 times per week about academics. 	Due to the low response rate of the parent non-user survey, potential barriers to using the SchoolMAX family portal could not be addressed in this study. However, this issue may be a useful research topic in a future study. Keywords: school to home communication, student information systems, family portal, parent porta...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{diasporic}} experiences of Ghanaians in London and assesses how Ghanaian identity is redefined and constructed in new contexts. The mediated experience dimension of this exploration considers the difference that the diverse <b>menu</b> of cultural <b>resources</b> offered by television is making to dispositions, cultural proclivities, {{and patterns of}} identification across intergenerational differences among Ghanaian-Londoners. The study qualitatively assembles and analyses empirical data from primary sources and integrates material from secondary sources to draw its conclusions. The thesis traces {{the development of the}} black diaspora as the historical antecedent or precursor to more recent black diasporic formations. The concept of the black diaspora provides a context for understanding or imagining the fledgling Ghanaian diaspora as another offshoot within the family of black identities in Britain. It is argued that the perceptions of blackness that Ghanaian- Londoners encountered in Britain were derived from the racial construction of blackness as the antithesis of whiteness and hence its construction as deviance. This was purveyed in discourses and reinforced in the public imagination through the media. Not only did it run counter to their self-perceptions, it impinged on their experiences as black people as they were confronted with unflattering stereotypes which they repudiated. In marginal spaces they endeavoured to reinstitute traditions from the homeland and to establish a distinctive presence in the ensemble of black identities in Britain, which in part challenges the monolithic imaginations of blackness from ‘othering’ perspectives, and also highlights an area of blackness underrepresented in academic discourses. Furthermore, the study finds that in their cultural consumption, a factor of their diasporic experience, they exhibited a critical edge and a comparative attitude to screen representations, reflecting the dual and sometimes multiple perspectives of their diasporic condition which enabled them to critique or valorise certain cultural practices from the different worlds of their experience, an indication of processes of cultural negotiation, synthesis, and hybridisation. Overall, this thesis contributes to current academic debates around mediated experience and cultural transformations, and the understanding of processes at the intersections between modernity, diaspora and culture in the era of globalization...|$|R
