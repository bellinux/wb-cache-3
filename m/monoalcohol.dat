The organochloride-degrading activity was not observed in the presence of sodium sulfite as an alternative sulfur source, suggesting that the activity was part of the sulfur starvation response of the strain.

Furthermore the explored ultralow frequencies enabled to study dynamics at relatively low temperatures close to the glass transition (Tg). Results show, on the one hand, that Debye-like and α relaxation timescales dramatically approach to each other upon decreasing temperature to Tg. On the other hand, the analysis of partial polarization TSDC data confirms the single exponential character of the Debye-like relaxation in 2 E 1 H and rules out the presence of Rouse type modes in the scenario of a chain-like response.

Specifically, we have measured the low-temperature specific heat Cp {{for a set of}} glassy alcohols: normal and fully-deuterated ethanol, 1 - and 2 - propanol, and glycerol. Ethanol exhibits a very interesting polymorphism presenting three different solid phases at low temperature: a fully-ordered (monoclinic) crystal, an orientationally-disordered (cubic) crystal or 'orientational glass', and the ordinary structural glass. By measuring and comparing the low-temperature specific heat of the three phases, in the 'boson peak' range 2 - 10 K {{as well as in the}} tunneling-states range below 1 K, we are able to provide a quantitative confirmation that ''glassy behavior'' is not an exclusive property of amorphous solids. On the other hand, propanol is the simplest <b>monoalcohol</b> with two different stereoisomers (1 - and 2 -propanol), what allows us to study directly the influence of the spatial rearrangement of atoms on the universal properties of glasses. We have measured the specific heat of both isomers, finding a noteworthy quantitative difference between them. Finally, low-temperature specific-heat data of glassy glycerol have also been obtained. Here we propose a simple method based upon the soft-potential model to analyze low-temperature specific-heat measurements, and we use this method for a quantitative comparison of all these data of glassy alcohols and as a stringent test of several universal correlations and scaling laws suggested in the literature. In particular, we find that the interstitialcy model for the boson peak [A. V. Granato, Phys. Rev.

40|$|Um dos grandes desafios para os próximos anos é desenvolver alternativas de produção para energias sustentáveis. O {{biodiesel}} vem se posicionando como uma opção para a substituição dos combustíveis fósseis. Sua produção se dá pela transesterificação entre uma gordura e um monoálcool, liberando glicerol, que corresponde a 10 % do volume da reação. Grandes incrementos na produção de biodisel resultarão em volumes proporcionais de glicerol residual. Estudos têm mostrado que bactérias anaeróbias estritas e bactérias fermentativas são capazes de produzir hidrogênio, um combustível de alto valor energético, que não gera gases poluentes durante a sua queima.

As amostras foram submetidas a choque térmico para eliminação de bactérias hidrogenotróficas, crescidas em meio contendo glicerol em condições de anaerobiose e analisadas para a formação de hidrogênio. Foram identificadas por sequenciamento do gene 16 S rRNA, quinze espécies bacterianas capazes de crescer em meio com glicerol, sendo que destas nove apresentaram capacidade de produção de hidrogênio, correspondendo a Enterobacter ludwigii, Shigella sonnei, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Staphylococcus warneri, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus e Citrobacter freundii. Os isolados de Bacillus amyloliquefaciens mostraram maior rendimento na produção de hidrogênio com valores de 0, 50 ± 0, 20 mol H 2 /mol de glicerol, utilizando o meio enriquecido com 1, 5 % de glicerol residual. Adicionalmente, foi realizada análise de BLAST para verificar a presença dos genes HycC, HycE, HycF, HyfC, HyfF e HyfH relacionados à produção de hidrogênio. Este estudo foi desenvolvido utilizando apenas os microrganismos do gênero Bacillus, uma vez que, dentre os microrganismos isolados, apenas os Bacillus apresentam sequenciamento completo disponível na rede de bioinformática.

One of {{the major}} challenges for the coming years is to develop alternative forms of production for sustainable energy. The biodiesel is positioning itself as an option for the replacement of fossil fuels. Its production is by transesterification between a fat and a <b>monoalcohol,</b> releasing glycerol, which corresponds to 10 % {{of the volume of}} the reaction. Large increases in the production of biodiesel result in proportional amounts of crude glycerol. Studies have shown that strict anaerobic and fermentative bacteria are able to produce hydrogen, a fuel of high energy value, which does not generate polluting gases, during its burning. Given the importance of increasing the added value-added of crude glycerol, {{the purpose of this study}} was to isolate and identify by molecular techniques, bacteria present in sewage sludge from waste treatment plants, it is capable of producing hydrogen using crude glycerol of biodiesel industry, as a carbon source. The samples were subjected to thermal shock to eliminate hydrogenotrophic bacterias, grown in the medium containing glycerol under anaerobic conditions and analyzed to produce hydrogen. Were identified by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, 15 bacterial species able to grow in medium with glycerol, and from these, nine showed the ability of hydrogen production, corresponding to Enterobacter ludwigii, Shigella sonnei, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Staphylococcus warneri, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrhopheus and Citrobacter freundii. The Bacillus amyloliquefaciens isolate showed higher yield in the production of hydrogen, with values of 0. 50 ± 0. 20 mol H 2 /mol of glycerol, using the enriched medium with 1. 5 % crude glycerol. In addition, BLAST analysis were performed to check the presence of genes HycC, HycE, HycF, HyfC, HyfF and HyfH related to hydrogen production. This study was developed using microorganisms of genus Bacillus, since, among the isolated microorganisms, only the Bacillus have complete DNA sequencing available. It was found that B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis and B. artrophaeus do not have the specific genes analyzed, but these genes have similarity with other genes and proteins that appear to perform roles in the transport of hydrogen to outside the cell.

However, the relaxation dynamics is more complicated for hydrogen bonded liquids.

For polyalcohols this process has been thought to be absent or possibly obscured by a strong contribution from conductivity and polarization effects at low frequencies. We here show that the Debye-like process, although much less prominent, is also present in the response of polyalcohols.

They have a steep onset at the dissociation threshold and show a dramatic D/H isotope effect. We assigned them as proceeding via shape resonances with temporary occupation of σ * O–H orbitals. These low energy fragmentations become much stronger in the larger molecules and the strongest DEA process in the compounds with two hydroxyl groups, which thus represent an intermediate case between the behavior of small alcohols and the sugar ribose which was discovered to have strong DEA fragmentations near zero electron energy [S.

Using ethylene glycol cryoprotected PS II illuminated at 130 K, a g = 4. 1 signal was generated which exhibited a temperature dependence consistent with it arising from a ground state species. Using sucrose cryoprotected PS II illuminated at 200 K (in the absence of <b>monoalcohols),</b> a g = 4. 1 signal was cogenerated with the multiline signal. At temperatures above ∼ 20 K, a signal at g ∼ 6 became evident in these samples. The temperature dependencies of the multiline, g = 4. 1 and g ∼ 6 signals were quantitatively consistent with them arising from the first 3 states (spin 123252) respectively of a weakly antiferromagnetically coupled Mn III-IV dimer. The temperature dependence of the signals in these samples indicated that the g = 4. 1 signal now arose from a centre displaying excited state behaviour. The two types of g = 4. 1 signal were very similar in shape at X-band but showed significantly different line shapes at Q-band. It is suggested that they arise from separate, near axial, S = 32 centres in well-defined states. A model is proposed, based on the temperature dependencies, ESR line shapes and probable spin states, {{to suggest that the}} four Mn ions are arranged as two exchange coupled pairs and that each g = 4. 1 signal arises from a separate manganese dimer. The ground state g = 4. 1 signal then requires the involvement of at least one additional spin 12 species, coupling to each Mn of a homodimer (probably IV-IV oxidation state). The spin 12 centre may be an oxidised protein side chain, possibly acting as a bridging ligand between the two Mn ions. It is concluded that the Mn dimers are sufficiently spatially separated within the protein structure to exclude magnetic exchange between the dimers, but within range to allow rapid electron transfer...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work cyclic voltammetric and {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic investigations of fifteen quinones have been carried out. Quinones belong to a class of organic compounds, which find potential applications in biology and chemistry. Five compounds {{from each of the}} three series of quinones, namely benzoquinones (BQs), naphthoquinones (NQs) and anthraquinones (AQs), were selected for the present study. Systematic cyclic voltammetric measurements were made on all compounds in solvents dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile (AN) and propylene carbonate (PC) atn 25 oC. Analysis of the voltammograms provided fundamental electrochemical parameters (redox potentials, peak separation, peak currents, half-wave potential, peak width) which helped in the interpretation of role of solvents, role of structure and the effect of substituents. The redox behaviour of the compounds was examined first within a series and then a comparative analysis of the three series was made. It was found that substituents affect strongly the redox bahaviour of the compounds. The quinones with electron withdrawing groups were easily reduced than those with electron releasing groups. Among the three series the ease of reduction followed the order BQs>NQs>AQs. 2 -Hydroxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone behaved differently due to self protonation. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (ko) of the first and the second reduction steps were determined in the three solvents employing Nicholson and Kochi methods. The experimental results were compared with those calculated theoretically from the modified form of the Marcus theory. The solvent reorganization energy (λo) in the Marcus equation was calculated using the conventional spherical as well as multisphere models. Experimental rate constants in acetonitrile from the Kochi’s method for benzoquinones, naphthoquinones and anthraquinones were found in the range 1. 65 x 10 - 3 – 8. 47 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1, 7. 09 x 10 - 3 – 11. 16 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1, and 0. 19 x 10 - 3 – 7. 10 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1 respectively. The experimentally determined rate constants for quinones were found in close agreement with the theoretically calculated rate constants from the Kochi’s method. The effect of medium on electron transfer rates was rationalized in terms of solvent properties such as polarity, viscosity, density relaxation time. An increase in the solvent polarity and a decrease in viscosity favoured the heterogeneous iii electron transfer rate. Electron transfer rates were found inversely proportional to solvent longitudinal relaxation time. Electrochemical behaviour of quinones was also investigated in the presence of tert-butanol, 2 -propanol, ethanol and methanol (<b>monoalcohols),</b> ethylene glycol (a diol) and glycerol (a triol) as proton donors. The quinone-alcohol interaction was analyzed from changes observed in the shape and peak position of the redox waves in voltammograms as a result of change in concentration of the added alcohol. An estimate of the strength of the quinone-alcohol interaction which is hydrogen bonding in nature was obtained by calculating the thermodynamic association constants and the number of alcohol molecules attached to anion or dianion of quinones. The interaction with dianion was found much stronger than with the anion. The strength of the hydrogen bond depended upon the basicity of the quinone and acidity of the alcohol. The presence of α- hydrogens in the quinone structure strengthened the interaction. A comparison of the results for <b>monoalcohols,</b> diol and triol shows that the polyalcohols formed stronger hydrogen bonds. The strength of interaction increased with {{the increase in the number}} of OH groups. Homogeneous electron transfer rate constants of quinones in acetonitrile were determined from ESR spectroscopic measurements at 298 K. The anion radical of the quinone was generated in situ in a locally fabricated esr-electrochemical cell and the hyperfine spectrum recorded. The hyperfine coupling constants and the line widths were determined from the experimental and simulated ESR spectra. The electron self exchange rate constant was determined from the concentration depended chemical line broadening produced by the addition of neutral quinone. The rate constants were found in the range of 5. 2 x 108 - 4. 4 x 109 M- 1 s- 1. The strength of precursor complex is observed in terms of association constants (KA) calculated from the experimental electron transfer rate constants are in the range 0. 028 – 1. 023 M- 1. Theoretical values of KA were calculated using Eigen-Fuoss and reaction zone models. The values calculated with the reaction zone model agreed with the experimentally determined values. The ESR results support the observed trends in electrochemical behaviour of quinones...|$|R
40|$|A isoforma α-tripsina bovina foi purificada a partir de amostras comerciais por cromatografia de troca iônica catiônica. A pureza desta amostra foi confirmada por MALDI-ToF cujo valor foi de 23. 312 Da. Essa isoforma da tripsina foi submetida a diferentes concentrações de monoalcoóis e DMSO e esta foi capaz de manter a metade de sua atividade em 60 % v/v de etanol-tampão. Por essa capacidade outros testes subsequentes foram realizados a fim de entender melhor este processo. O efeito de íons Ca 2 + e Cl- estabilizou a α-tripsina em até 20 mmol. L- 1, tanto no sistema aquoso quanto no sistema etanol-tampão, contudo acima desta concentração estes íons passaram a desestabilizar a molécula proteica influenciando na diminuição da sua atividade catalítica. Entretanto a estrutura da α-tripsina monitorada por espectroscopia UV nos resíduos aromáticos, com adição de até 80 % v/v de etanol permaneceu como na forma nativa. Um teste de cinética comparando a atividade da α-tripsina em tampão e etanol-tampão mostrou que o etanol funcionou como inibidor não competitivo. Entretanto, nos testes de termodinâmica utilizando a técnica de monitoramento do resíduo aromático Tyr a 285 nm, mostrou que na série de monoalcoóis apenas o {{n-propanol}} contribuiu de forma significativa na diminuição do Tm em comparação com os demais alcoóis e sistema tampão. Finalmente podemos concluir que o sistema solvente orgânico diminui a atividade enzimática de duas maneiras: atuando como inibidor não competitivo e provocando alterações irreversíveis nas proteínas diminuindo o número de moléculas disponíveis para realizar catálise. Bovine α-trypsin isoform was purified {{from commercial}} samples by cationic ion exchange chromatography. The purity of this sample {{was confirmed by}} MALDI-ToF and the value found was 23, 312 Da. Trypsin was subjected to different concentrations of mono alcohols and DMSO and {{it was able to}} keep half of its activity in 60 % v/v ethanol-buffer. Due this capacity, other subsequent tests were performed in order {{to a better understanding of}} this process. The effect of Ca 2 + and Cl- ions stabilized α-trypsin till 20 mmol. L- 1, in both aqueous and ethanol-buffer systems, however above this concentration, these ions tend to destabilize the protein molecule influencing the reduction in its catalytic activity. However, the structure of α-trypsin monitored by UV spectroscopy on the aromatic residues, with addition of 80 % v / v ethanol, remained as in native form. A kinetic test comparing the α-trypsin activity in ethanol-buffer and buffer showed that ethanol act as a non-competitive inhibitor. However, in thermodynamic assay using the monitoring technique aromatic residue, Tyr at 285 nm, showed that only n-propanol, in the series of <b>monoalcohols,</b> contributed significantly to decrease the Tm as comparing to with other alcohols and buffer system. Finally, we can conclude that the organic solvent system decreases the enzymatic activity of two ways: by acting as non-competitive inhibitor and causing irreversible changes in the protein by decreasing the number of molecules available to perform catalysis...|$|R
40|$|International @ BIOVERT+LCD:MBE:CPIInternational audiencentroduction Nowadays, a large {{range of}} acids are {{produced}} from biomass via either chemical or biochemical transformations. The production of levulinic acid from lignocellulosic derivatives under acidic conditions {{has been described}} since the early nineteens, but large scale applications were reported more recently involving continuous processing by the Biofine technology [1]. Besides, biosuccinic acid is now produced via an economically viable process from renewable sources by different companies [2, 3]. These acids are considered as platform molecules that can be further transformed into added value products. The hydrogenation of these acids leads {{to the formation of}} lactone, cyclic ether or diol and represents promising alternatives to current petrochemical productions [4, 5]. To avoid the use of undesirable stoechiometric hydride reductants, the catalytic hydrogenation of biobased carboxylic acids has received strong interest. The preparation of heterogeneous catalysts which are s table under the reaction conditions and selective to a specific product is essential to achieve a competitive route. In the present work, the reactivity of mono and bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LEV) and succinic acid (SUC) is reported, paying special attention to the optimization of the selectivity into diols. The reactivity of both acids will be compared. Experimental Catalyst preparation Active carbon and titanium oxide were used as supports. The monometallic catalysts were synthesized by wet impregnation or cationic exchange method. The amount of precursor was adjusted in order to achieve ca 2 - 3 % weight. Bimetallic xwt. %Me-ywt. %Re catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the monometallic catalysts with NH 4 ReO 4 precursor salt. Finally, the bimetallic catalysts were reduced under hydrogen flow at 450 °C for 3 h. The metallic phase was characterized by means of various physicochemical methods: ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry), H 2 chemisorption, TEM (transmission electron microscopy), TPR (temperature programmed reduction) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy); {{as well as by the}} gas phase model reaction of cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Acid hydrogenation In a typical batch reaction, the reactor (Hastelloy) was loaded with an aqueous solution of the considered acid (SUC or LEV) and the catalyst. After purging with Ar, the reactor was heated to the desired temperature under H 2 pressure. The samples taken from the reactor at regular intervals during reaction were analyzed using both GC and HPLC. The main reaction products consisted of lactones (GBL, GVL), cyclic ethers (THF, MeTHF) and diols (BDO, PDO) with some by-products (<b>monoalcohols,</b> mono acids) (Scheme 1). The mass balance was checked by measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the liquid phase. Scheme 1 : Hydrogenation of succinic acid (SucA) and levulinic acid (LevA) to lactone, cyclic ether and diol. Results and discussion The distribution of the products was affected by the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. When monometallic catalysts were used in the reaction, lactones were formed as the main product regardless the nature of the metal. In order to observe the formation of diols or cyclic ethers, bimetallic catalysts must be used. As an example, the catalytic performances of a Re-Ru/C catalyst for levulinic (LEV) and succinic (SUC) acid hydrogenation are reported in Fig. 1. Figure 1 : Main products distribution during the hydrogenation of LEV and SUC (reaction conditions: [acid] 0 = 0. 43 mol/l, 160 °C, 150 bar, 4 %Re- 2 %Ru/C) Since the hydrogenation of a ketone group is easier than the hydrogenation of a carboxylic group, LEV is much more easily converted to the lactone than SUC. As a consequence, a very high selectivity in GVL (90 %) was achieved from LEV within less than 1 h, while SUC yielded ca. 40 % GBL after 8 h. Subsequent hydrogenation of the lactones to the corresponding diols was then possible. However concomitant overhydrogenolysis occurred and almost 40 % of mass balance were missing in the case of LEV. To overcome this drawback, the reaction has been carried out at lower temperature. As expected, the reaction rate decreased with the temperature but a significant positive effect on the selectivity to the diol was observed. In the presence of RuRe/C, GVL was completely hydrogenated after 22 h at 160 °C (Fig. 1 a), while 48 h and 72 h are necessary to achieve complete hydrogenation at 140 °C and 120 °C, respectively. However, the selectivity to PDO increased from 69 % up to 80 % while the temperature was lower (Fig. 2). Simultaneously, the selectivity to ether (MTHF) and <b>monoalcohols</b> (1 -pentanol, 2 -pentanol and 2 -butanol) decreased and the mass balance was much better (from 60 % at 160 °C up to 90 % at 120 °C). This was mainly attributed to the lower formation of degradation products issued from cracking of the substrate or the intermediates. Figure 2 : Influence of the temperature on the product distribution at 100 % GVL conversion. Reaction conditions: [LEV] 0 = 0. 43 mol/l, 2. 2 %Ru- 3. 8 %Re/C, molar ratio LEV/Ru = 2000, 150 bar. Alcohols = 1 -PeOH + 2 -PeOH + 2 -BuOH. The different physicochemical techniques used to characterize PdRe catalysts evidenced interactions between both metallic species that could be responsible of the peculiar reactivity of these bimetallic catalysts. Conclusions The heterogeneous hydrogenation of biobased acids can be efficiently carried out in water in the presence of supported mono or bimetallic catalysts and leads to the formation of the lactone or the diol depending on the reaction conditions and the nature of the catalyst.
