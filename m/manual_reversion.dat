5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the <b>manual</b> <b>reversion</b> control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In <b>manual</b> <b>reversion</b> mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no <b>manual</b> <b>reversion,</b> a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
25|$|Drawing on {{experience}} from the Panavia Tornado, the AMX {{is equipped with}} a hybrid flight control system; a fly-by-wire control system is employed to operate flight control surfaces such as the spoilers, rudder and variable incidence tailplane, while the ailerons and elevators are actuated via a dual-redundant hydraulic system. <b>Manual</b> <b>reversion</b> is provided for the ailerons, elevator and rudder to allow the aircraft to be flown even in the event of complete hydraulic failure; either control system can act independent of one another. The wing is fitted with both leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps and overwing spoilers ahead of the flaps. The spoilers can function as airbrakes and to negate lift; improving take-off and landing performance as well as manoeuvrability during flight.|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into <b>manual</b> <b>reversion,</b> meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E

5000|$|In many piston {{engine-powered}} helicopters, {{the pilot}} manipulates the throttle to maintain rotor speed.

50|$|The {{high-performance}} AS365 N3 {{was developed}} for operations in 'hot and high' climates, and introduced 635 kW (851 shp) Arriel 2C turboshafts equipped with a single channel DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) with <b>manual</b> <b>reversion,</b> mated to an uprated main transmission for better single engine performance. The AS365 N3 also features a redesigned ten blade composite Fenestron anti-torque device with asymmetric blade distribution, offering a further reduction in noise signature. The AS365 N3's gross weight is 4300 kg. Production deliveries began in December 1998 and this version is currently still in production. Also manufactured in Brazil by Helibras.|$|E

50|$|Dassault {{emphasised}} {{the commercial}} value of the Mercure, highlighting its low operating costs across short sectors, which principally resulted from its refined aerodynamic features and low structural weight. The design also benefitted from an advanced fail-safe structure, the majority of which having been milled in accordance to Dassault's traditional military manufacturing practices. The Mercure featured in-house-developed triplicated, fail-safe hydraulic flight control system; the flight controls lacked any <b>manual</b> <b>reversion.</b> Air conditioning also featured independent duplicated systems with a cross-feed tapped from the engines compressors along with, unusually, the auxiliary power unit (APU) for use during takeoffs and on the ground, {{as well as in}} the instance of a double-engine failure scenario. The electrics were composed of a pair of independent 120/128 volt three-phase 400 Hz AC systems fed via engine-driven alternators, while a third AC system was driven by the APU; in addition, there are three independent 28 volt DC sources.|$|E
