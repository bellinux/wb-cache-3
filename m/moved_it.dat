5|$|Cisski died on August 25, 1992. In 1993 the University repossessed the {{building}} {{occupied by the}} coffeehouse, and the Last Exit's new owners <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to upper University Way. The Last Exit on Brooklyn closed in 2000. The space the original Last Exit once occupied now houses staff members from the University of Washington's Human Resources Department.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E

50|$|On {{a manual}} milling machine, the {{micrometer}} adjustment nut limits the depth {{to which the}} cutting tool may plunge into the workpiece. It is located on a threaded rod on the mill head. The machine operator <b>moves</b> <b>it</b> up or down by rotating <b>it</b> clockwise (to <b>move</b> <b>it</b> down) or counter-clockwise (to <b>move</b> <b>it</b> up). <b>Moving</b> the nut down increases the depth to which the cutting tool may plunge into the workpiece. Moving the nut up reduces the depth to which the cutting tool may plunge into the workpiece.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, a beehive metal {{sculpture}} by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was {{criticized by the}} council for installment adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> {{to another part of}} the park.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{originally}} {{described the}} hawksbill sea turtle as Testudo imbricata in 1766, in the 12th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae. In 1843, Austrian zoologist Leopold Fitzinger <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> into genus Eretmochelys. In 1857, the species was temporarily misdescribed as Eretmochelys imbricata squamata.|$|E
5|$|Scelidosaurus harrisonii, named and {{described}} by Owen, {{is currently the}} only recognized species, based on several nearly complete skeletons. A potential second species from the Sinemurian-age Lower Lufeng Formation, Scelidosaurus oehleri, was described by David Jay Simmons in 1965 under its own genus, Tatisaurus. In 1996 Spencer G. Lucas <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Scelidosaurus. Although the fossils are fragmentary, this reassessment has not been accepted, and S. oehleri is today once again recognized as Tatisaurus.|$|E

Here he met Friedrich Grotrian who was traveling for business. In 1854, Friedrich Grotrian received the Müller-Mühlenbein pharmacy as an inheritance from an uncle, so he {{moved back to}} Germany to manage it. He joined C.F. Theodor Steinweg's piano company {{as a partner in}} 1856.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

In 1994, as an organ soloist, {{he won the}} Danish qualification rounds and national final of the Eurovision Young Musicians competition. He was one of eight winners of the 24 national competitions that year to be selected for the European final, held at the Philharmonic Concert Hall in Warsaw, Poland on 14 June 1994. He performed Francis Poulenc's Organ Concerto, but was not placed in the top 3. The Polish organizers originally planned the qualifying round to be held elsewhere, but <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to the Philharmonic Hall (which contains a pipe organ) to accommodate Magle's participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, {{created a}} new bell foundry (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of £1/13/4 (£1.67) for {{premises}} in the Almshouse building. He recast the six bells of Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas's eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton {{to take over the}} bell foundry. Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Exeter in 1850.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E

5|$|Inn-yard theatres {{were first}} {{established}} in the Tudor period, with the Boar's Head Inn (1557) in Whitechapel, the George in Stepney and a purpose built, but short lived, John Brayne's Red Lion Theatre (1567), nearby. The first permanent theatres with resident companies were constructed in Shoreditch, with James Burbage's The Theatre (1576) and Henry Lanman's Curtain Theatre (1577) standing close together. On the night of 28 December 1598 Burbage's sons dismantled The Theatre, and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> piece by piece across the Thames to construct the Globe Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Aelius Sejanus {{had served}} the {{imperial}} family for {{almost twenty years}} when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed {{the ranks of the}} Praetorian Guard responsible for the defense of the city, and had <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself, giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Earl {{also built}} the Grade II* listed Gardener's House {{at the back}} of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head {{gardener}} of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess Diana had been intent on living in the house following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, The Shipwrecked Mariner, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from a raft. Charles Spencer has since <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> from the main portico of Gardener's House to the main house.|$|E

5|$|The Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} suffrage leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas. With the exception of Way, all these women {{were the first to}} address the Indiana State Legislature on January 19, 1859, with petitions calling for women's suffrage, temperance, and equal rights. In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 {{hurt the}} Spirit's circulation, but Porter responded by buying out his main competition, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine and <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to New York City. Porter edited the Turf Register until the paper stopped being {{published}} in 1844. Porter continued {{the publication of}} annual stallion lists and the publication of lists of horses owned by breeders. However, {{the purchase of the}} American Turf Register strained Porter's finances, and he sold the Spirit to another printer, John Richards, who retained Porter as editor. The 1840s were prosperous, but in the 1850s the magazine again encountered difficulties. Around 1855, Porter left Richards' paper, and in 1856, another printer, George Wilkes, began a new sporting newspaper, which he called Porter's Spirit of the Times, and employed Porter as editor.|$|E
5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol.
