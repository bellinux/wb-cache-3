They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E

For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
