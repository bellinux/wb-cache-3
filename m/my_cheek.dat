2500|$|Written in an {{uplifting}} {{first person}} narrative, the song depicts Clarkson's {{journey from the}} past and her vision in the future, with the chorus revealing her new life mantra. Lipshutz noted, [...] "I've spent most of my time catching my breath, letting it go, turning <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> {{for the sake of the}} show!" [...] Clarkson sings, before promising to spend the rest of her days appreciating what she has and being herself." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "While Clarkson has clocked plenty of songs about the perils of love over the course of her career, her romance on this single is more positive than in the past." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E

You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
