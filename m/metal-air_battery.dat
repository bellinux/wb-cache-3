Overcoming these obstacles is essential to creating a rechargeable <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> that can be utilised for efficiently capturing renewable energy. Despite the first <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> being created over 100 years ago, the emergence of reactive metals such as lithium has reinvigorated interest in this field. However the reactivity of some of these metals has generated a number of different philosophies regarding the electrolyte of the <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery.</b> Whilst much is already known about the anode and cathode processes in aqueous and organic electrolytes, the shortcomings of these electrolytes (i. e. volatility, instability, flammability etc.) have led some of the <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> community to study room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as non-volatile, highly stable electrolytes that have the potential to support rechargeable <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> processes. In this perspective, we discuss how some of these initial studies have demonstrated the capabilities of RTILs as <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> electrolytes.

Recently, sustainable energy conversion and storage systems, such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries, have been developed rapidly. Among these various new energy devices, fuel cells and <b>metal–air</b> <b>batteries</b> have received increasing attention because of their low contribution to pollution. However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), {{one of the key}} reactions of fuel cells and <b>metal–air</b> <b>batteries,</b> has sluggish intrinsic electrode kinetics, hampering the practical application of fuel cells and <b>metal–air</b> <b>batteries</b> [3].

40|$|Metal-air batteries, {{especially}} lithium {{and sodium}} air systems, have attracted significant research {{effort in the}} past decade. The high theoretical specific energy (3500 Wh/kg for Li-O 2 and 1600 Wh/kg for Na-O 2) and moderate equilibrium potential (2. 96 V for Li-O 2 and 2. 3 V for Na-O 2) make these chemistries attractive energy storage platforms for transportation, autonomous aircraft, and emergent robotics technologies. The term <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery,</b> however, {{is often used to}} describe the system which is actually a "metal-O 2 " battery, for in most studies O 2 is used in place of air as the active material in the battery cathode. This change is employed to eliminate formation of electrochemically stable metal hydroxide and metal carbonate discharge products when CO 2 and moisture present in ambient air react with metal ions in the cathode. Therefore, when it comes to practical design and operation of <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery,</b> significant new complications that largely defeat the competitive advantages of this storage technology will be introduced into the <b>metal-air</b> <b>battery</b> system due to the impurities in the ambient air. Recent work has shown that when a mixture of O 2 and CO 2 is used as the active material in the cathode, it is possible to recharge a metalO 2 /CO 2 cell provided steps are taken to prevent electrolyte decomposition during the recharge. In the current work, we studied electrochemical processes in model sodiumO 2 /CO 2 (Na-O 2 /CO 2) cells. We find that provided that with the formation of the electrochemically stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces, such cells are able to deliver both exceptional energy storage capacity and stable long-term charge-discharge cycling behaviors at room temperature. NaHCO 3 is shown to be the principal discharge product through in- and ex-situ chemical analysis of the cathode. The modification on the electrolyte to make it stable under high voltage is crucial for the rechargeability of the system. By means of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we show that addition of as little as 10 % of electrolyte additive extends the high-voltage stability of the electrolyte by at least 1 V, allowing recharge of the Na-CO 2 /O 2 cells. We also report a novel primary Li-CO 2 battery that consumes pure CO 2 gas in its cathode. The battery exhibits a high discharge capacity of around 2500 mAh/g at moderate temperatures.
