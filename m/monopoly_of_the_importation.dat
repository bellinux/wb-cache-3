50|$|Due {{to various}} {{differences}} in cultural histories and environmental resources, West African nations developed glass traditions distinct from Egypt, North Africa and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> glass in Sub-Saharan Africa mostly consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> glass beads shipped {{primarily from the}} Middle East and Indian as early as 200-300AD; later, from Portugal, the Netherlands, and Venice.|$|R

40|$|Dutch local {{authorities}} used to acquire land long before urban development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land took place. Recently, private development companies have become {{active in the}} Dutch land market. <b>The</b> public <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land market {{has been transformed into}} private <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building market. One option to introduce more competition into the building market is to separate landownership from development-and-construction rights. A radical amendment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expropriation legislation seems to be necessary to promote the transparent and effective implementation of spatial policies. Property rights could be limited to promote competition in the building market, and to safeguard <b>the</b> public dimension <b>of</b> urban development. ...|$|R
50|$|Fairfield is a Georgian-style {{plantation}} {{house built}} of native limestone around 1770 at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> a 1,600-acre landholding.

40|$|Veterinarians have {{an active}} {{interest}} in <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> South American beef into this country. During the prolonged controversy which has raged over this question, they have lined up, in general, with livestock men in opposing measures {{which would allow}} South American beef to be imported into the United States in any considerable degree. In both cases, those opposed to importation do not always consider all the facts bearing on the problem; and many opposing arguments fail to distinguish between <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> fresh beef and that of canned beef...|$|R
25|$|Under Abbas' reign, {{carpet weaving}} {{increased}} {{its role as}} {{an important part of}} Persian industry and culture, as wealthy Europeans started importing Persian rugs. Silk production became a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown, and manuscripts, bookbinding, and ceramics were also important exports.|$|R
40|$|International {{cooperation}} in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> policing {{is linked to}} <b>the</b> definitional core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legitimate use <b>of</b> force (Max Weber). Whereas international {{cooperation in}} other fields has been widely analyzed, there is no systematic measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development and intensity of international police cooperation over time. The paper disaggregates <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> force into three components (legitimation, methods and authorization) and analyzes how international police coop eration in Western Europe has developed since the 1960 s and how strongly it impinges upon state sovereignty. Whereas in the 1960 s, most international institutions in the field were only weak, <b>the</b> state <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legitimate use <b>of</b> force has been embedded, pooled or even delegated since the 1990 s. Even in its core activity, the Western European state {{has become part of}} a multi-level system of governance...|$|R

50|$|Although <b>the</b> {{entering}} <b>of</b> Indonesia {{resulted in}} a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central trading ports, through closed trading ports, this helped <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> Islam, as <b>the</b> local Muslim traders relocated to the smaller more remote ports, establishing Islam into the more rural provinces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} six Pashii copies built by Kisha Seizō, 1923 saw <b>the</b> {{delivery}} <b>of</b> another six similar locomotives from Kawasaki <b>of</b> Japan, <b>the</b> Pashisa class. Originally numbered 957-962, they became パシサ1-パシサ6 in Sentetsu's general renumbering <b>of</b> 1938. <b>The</b> success <b>of</b> these engines and the Japanese-built Pashii copies proved that domestic (i.e. Japanese, Manchurian and Korean) industry {{was more than}} capable of building satisfactory locomotives, and signalled <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> locomotives from foreign sources.|$|R
25|$|The English and French {{had very}} {{different}} trading hierarchical structures. The Hudson's Bay Company had a technical <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beaver trade within <b>the</b> drainage basin <b>of</b> Hudson Bay while the Compagnie d'Occident {{was given a}} <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beaver trade farther south. The English organized their trade on strictly hierarchical lines while the French used licenses to lease <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> their posts. This meant that the French incentivized <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> trade, and French traders did indeed infiltrate much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Lakes region. The French established posts on Lake Winnipeg, Lac des Praires and Lake Nipigon which represented {{a serious threat to}} flow <b>of</b> furs to <b>the</b> York Factory. The increasing penetration near English ports now meant that the Aboriginals had more than one place to sell their goods.|$|R
25|$|The line {{passed its}} second {{reading in the}} commons despite fierce {{opposition}} from the London and Birmingham and the newly formed Midland Railway, who at that time had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London to Leeds and York traffic, and despite an adverse report from <b>the</b> Board <b>of</b> Trade.|$|R
25|$|The Communists quickly {{abolished}} {{slavery and}} serfdom in their traditional forms. They also {{claim to have}} reduced taxes, unemployment, and beggary, and to have started work projects. They established secular schools, thereby breaking <b>the</b> educational <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monasteries, and they constructed running water and electrical systems in Lhasa.|$|R
50|$|A further {{joint venture}} with the Great Western Railway led to Merthyr. Although the GWR already had a {{presence}} at Merthyr through <b>the</b> Vale <b>of</b> Neath line, {{up to that point}} the Taff Vale Railway had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct routes from Merthyr to the south and east.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{emerging}} <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{store has}} been criticized by Mike Lang of Miramax for [...] "effectively strangling the industry". He says that because the music industry has allowed too few content providers, it is now suffering. Lang views the issue as being more of a threat than music piracy.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{interested}} businessmen promoted the Monkland & Kirkintilloch Railway {{to link the}} coal pits and iron works to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Kirkintilloch. If coal and minerals were transshipped there, they could reach not only Glasgow, escaping <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monkland Canal but also Edinburgh.|$|R
50|$|After the 2015 summit, the {{respective}} communications ministers, under a Russian proposal, had a first summit for their ministries in Moscow in October where the host minister, Nikolai Nikiforov, proposed an initiative to further tighten their information technology sectors and challenge <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States in the sector.|$|R
50|$|By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, the Dutch {{had become}} {{dominant}} in the trade that went via the Persian Gulf, having won most trade agreements, and managed to strike deals before the British or French were able to.

500|$|On 27 April 2005, Colonel Bambang Sugiarto, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bali police drug squad, {{said police}} {{would seek to}} have all nine charged with offenses which carry the death penalty.

30|$|The {{modified}} {{regression model}} {{has a higher}} R-squared of 0.85270. AT remains {{to have a positive}} and significant effect to trade value, however, <b>the</b> lag <b>of</b> AT shows a negative and significant effect on TV. This means that a decrease in AT will have a one period lag effect to TV. The dummy variable D 2 also shows a negative significant effect to TV. This validates that <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> AJCEP diverted some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> Japan from <b>the</b> Philippines to other ASEAN countries.|$|R
50|$|A British {{governor}} {{was appointed to}} the region and many settlers emigrated from Europe and the Cape Colony. The British established a sugar cane industry in the 1860s. Farm owners had a difficult time attracting Zulu labourers to work on their plantations, so the British brought thousands of indentured labourers from India on twenty five-year contracts. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> Indian labourers, Durban has the largest Asian community on the African continent, and has the largest Indian population outside of India.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} development came in 1834 when reformers in England who {{advocated for}} free trade succeeded in ending <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British East India Company under <b>the</b> Charter Act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year. This shift in trade policy opened the British China trade to private entrepreneurs, many <b>of</b> whom joined <b>the</b> highly profitable opium trade.|$|R
30|$|The typical {{path to the}} {{university}} was via school education and not via vocational training. Between 1780 and 1840 the transition from upper secondary school to university was bound to a formal school certificate, the Abitur.
