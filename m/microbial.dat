40|$|There {{have been}} contradicting {{reports of the}} {{efficacy}} of direct-fed <b>microbials</b> in finishing cattle diets. Some researchers have observed improvements in daily gain and feed efficiency when direct-fed <b>microbials</b> are included in finishing diets, whereas others have reported no differences in dry matter intake or ruminal and blood pH. Many of these {{studies have been conducted}} on a relatively small scale and used few animals per pen compared with that of typical commercial feedlot operations. In our study, yearling crossbred beef steers and heifers (n= 3, 539; 796 lb body weight) were used in an experiment conducted at a commercial feedlot operation to characterize growth performance and carcass characteristics associated with the supplementation of direct-fed <b>microbials</b> (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii) in finishing cattle diets. Including direct-fed <b>microbials</b> in the diet throughout a 122 -day finishing period had no measurable impact on growth performance or carcass characteristics of finishing cattle...|$|R

Small <b>microbial</b> pinnacles are also present, and it appears that the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different <b>microbial</b> communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E

5|$|It is {{suggested}} that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in the food chain caused the <b>microbial</b> mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the <b>microbial</b> substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{pest control}} with mass-produced {{arthropod}} natural enemies is well developed in greenhouse crops and has often {{resulted in the}} evolution of complex ecosystems with persistent populations of multiple arthropod natural enemy species. However, there are cases where arthropod natural enemies are either not effective enough, not available, or their use is rather costly. For these reasons, biological control based on microorganisms, also referred to as ‘microbials’, represents a complementary strategy for further development. Although commercially available <b>microbials</b> have been around for quite some time, research on and the applied use of combinations of arthropod natural enemies and <b>microbials</b> have remained relatively under explored. Here, we review current uses of entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses, and their possible direct and indirect effects on arthropod natural enemies in European greenhouses. We discuss how <b>microbials</b> might be combined with arthropod natural enemies in the light of new methodologies and technologies such as conservation biological control, greenhouse climate management, and formulation and delivery. Furthermore, we explore the possibilities of using other microorganisms for biological control, such as endophytes, and the need to understand the effect of insect-associated microorganisms, or symbionts, on the success of biological control. Finally, we suggest future research directions to optimize the combined use of <b>microbials</b> and arthropod natural enemies in greenhouse production. </p...|$|R

5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of <b>microbial</b> communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of <b>microbial</b> communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a <b>microbial</b> community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of <b>microbial</b> physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of <b>microbial</b> genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Some Ediacaran strata {{with the}} texture {{characteristics}} of <b>microbial</b> mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils {{are almost always}} found in beds that contain these <b>microbial</b> mats. Although <b>microbial</b> mats were once widespread, the evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian vastly reduced their numbers. These communities are now limited to inhospitable refugia, such as the stromatolites found in Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Shark Bay, Western Australia where the salt levels can be twice those of the surrounding sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex <b>microbial</b> communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these <b>microbial</b> communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding.

It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial <b>microbial</b> pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by <b>microbial</b> communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 <b>microbial</b> cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The <b>microbial</b> communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. <b>Microbial</b> consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these <b>microbial</b> communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E

50|$|Fermented fish is a {{traditional}} preservation of fish. Before refrigeration, canning and other modern preservation techniques became available, fermenting was an important preservation method. Fish rapidly spoils, or goes rotten, unless some method is applied to stop the bacteria that produce the spoilage. Fermentation is a method which attacks the ability of <b>microbials</b> to spoil fish. It does this by making the fish muscle more acidic; bacteria usually cease multiplying when the pH drops below 4.5.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} isolates from Saanen goats’ milk for probiotic attributes, thereby determining their potential as direct-fed <b>microbials</b> for goats. Isolates were identified using API 50 CH system, 16 S rDNA sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. All 17 isolates obtained were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum except one identified as Pediococcus acidilactici. Four isolates identified as L. plantarum (Accession numbers KJ 026587. 1, KM 207826. 1, KC 83663. 1 and KJ 958428. 1) by {{at least two of}} the techniques used and isolate 17 differently identified by all the methods used were selected as representatives and then screened for probiotic properties. These isolates displayed phenotypic probiotic attributes including tolerance to acid and bile salts, ability to adhere to intestines and possession of antagonistic activities against Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The lactic acid bacteria isolated from Saanen goats’ milk showed potential to be used as sustainable probiotics in goats’ industry.
