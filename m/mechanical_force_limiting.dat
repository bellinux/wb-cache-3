40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the power extraction capability for the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) concept BOLT®. Specifically, the impact of different control strategies on the power extraction and their high sensitivity to the incoming waves will be presented. The BOLT® concept is based on a flat point absorber designed with a small mass and a Power Take-Off (PTO) solely controlling the amplitude of the WEC's motion, passive loading. It is reported that the small weight of the device makes passive loading suitable for most sea states. As the device is still on the pilot stage, there is room for exploring the potential improvement of the power extraction for different sea states by determining the optimal control strategy for sinusoidal waves of different amplitudes and frequencies. In addition, when considering realistic designs of PTOs, the constraint on the peak power should be taken into account. The power handled by the electro-mechanical system is limited by the ratings of the electrical components and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> <b>limits.</b> Imposing a constraint on the peak power will greatly affect the control strategies’ impact and thus the average extracted power...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} spin and tidal interactions, fluid layers are {{ellipsoidal}} in most celestial bodies, such as planets, moons or stars. This departure from a spherical shape {{can lead to}} inertial instabilities, and thus volume-filling turbulence. Theoretical studies mainly consider weakly deformed spheres, while experimental or numerical studies use strongly deformed ellipsoids because of technical constraints. To bridge the gap, we present a general and versatile computational framework to perform linear global stability analysis of incompressible flows in arbitrary rotating ellipsoids. We present the uniform vorticity basic flow driven by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>forcing</b> in the <b>limit</b> of vanishing viscosity. Then we describe the inviscid stability analysis method. The latter gives the growth rate and velocity field of the unstable flow. Our framework relies on both symbolic and numeric computations to handle global perturbations of unprecedented complexity. It provides a unified understanding of inertial instabilities in rotating ellipsoids, bringing together and extending several previous studies under a common framework. We apply our method {{to the case of}} an orbiting fluid ellipsoid. We recover the two limiting cases, namely the tidally-driven and libration-driven elliptical instabilities. Finally, the general case of an orbiting body on an eccentric Kepler orbit is considered. In this case, several forcing frequencies are present and the ellipsoidal shape of the fluid body evolves in time. These effects give birth to new vigorous orbitally-driven elliptical instabilities...|$|R

However, the sensitivity and threshold for the activation of BCRs resulting from the stimulation by <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> are unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a double-stranded DNA-based tension gauge tether system serving as a predefined <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> gauge ranging from 12 to 56 pN.

40|$|Background: A sudden {{mechanical}} {{insult to}} the spinal cord is usually caused by changing pressure {{on the surface of}} the spinal cord. Most of these insults are <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> injuries, and their mechanism of injury to the spinal cord is largely unknown. Methods: Using a compression-driven instrument to simulate <b>mechanical</b> <b>force,</b> we applied <b>mechanical</b> pressure of 0. 5 MPa to rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons for 10 min to investigate cytoskeletal alterations and calpain-induced apoptosis after the <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> injury. Results: The results indicated that <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> affect the structure of the cytoskeleton and cell viability, induce early apoptosis, and affect the cell cycle of DRG neurons. In addition, the calpain inhibitor PD 150606 reduced cytoskeletal degradation and the rate of apoptosis after <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> injury. Conclusion: Thus, calpain may play an important role in DRG neurons in the regulation of apoptosis and cytoskeletal alterations induced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>force.</b> Moreover, cytoskeletal alterations may be substantially involved in the mechanotransduction process in DRG neurons after mechanical injury and may be induced by activated calpain. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate a relationship between cytoskeletal degradation and apoptosis in DRG neurons...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Mechanobiology is an {{emerging}} {{field of science}} {{that focuses on the}} way physical forces and changes in cell or tissue mechanics contribute to development, physiology, and disease. As nails are always exposed to physical stimulation, <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> may have a particularly pronounced effect on nail configuration and could be involved in the development of nail deformities. However, the role of mechanobiology in nail configuration and deformities has rarely been assessed. This review describes what is currently understood regarding the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> on nail configuration and deformities. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that nails have an automatic curvature function that allows them to adapt to the daily upward <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces.</b> Under normal conditions, the upward daily <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> and the automatic curvature force are well balanced. However, an imbalance between these 2 forces may cause nail deformation. For example, pincer nails may be caused by the absence of upward <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> or a genetic propensity increase in the automatic curvature force, whereas koilonychias may occur when the upward <b>mechanical</b> <b>force</b> exceeds the automatic curvature force, thereby causing the nail to curve outward. This hypothesis is a new concept that could aid the development of innovative methods to prevent and treat nail deformities...|$|R
