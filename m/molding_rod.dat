25|$|The window {{treatments}} {{were another}} area of disagreement between du Pont and Boudin. Du Pont wanted the window treatments inside the window frame, to expose the moldings. Boudin felt this made the room appear too tall. After the two discussed the issue in early 1961, du Pont's view won out. But in late 1962, Boudin removed these window treatments and implemented one he had used many times before in many different homes: Straight panels to hide the side moldings, with a Baroque Revival flat panel to cover the top <b>molding</b> and <b>rods.</b> The fabric used was the same Boudin had selected for the wall covering, but trimmed with a French-made decorative silver tape.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} design of a {{radio-frequency}} induction-heated rod casting furnace that permits the preparation of polycrystalline ingots of intermetallic compounds under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions. The central part of the system is a bespoke water-cooled Hukin crucible supporting a casting mold. Depending on the choice of <b>mold,</b> typical <b>rods</b> have a diameter between 6 mm and 10 mm and a length up to 90 mm, suitable for single-crystal growth by means of float-zoning. The setup is all-metal sealed and may be baked out. We find that the resulting ultra-high vacuum represents an important precondition for processing compounds with high vapor pressures under a high-purity argon atmosphere up to 3 bar. Using the rod casting furnace, we succeeded to prepare large high-quality single crystals of two half-Heusler compounds, namely the itinerant antiferromagnet CuMnSb and the half-metallic ferromagnet NiMnSb.

40|$|This {{research}} effort {{aimed at}} {{a better understanding of}} microbial phenomena taking place during time in spontaneous sourdough fermentation for broa, a traditional Portuguese bread. Unlike most microbiological studies of sourdough, viable counts obtained were not limited to Lactobacillus and yeasts, but encompassed also <b>molds,</b> Gram-negative <b>rods,</b> endospore-(non) forming Gram-positive rods and catalase-positive/negative Gram-positive cocci. This less conventional approach unveiled the ubiquitous Bacillus genus throughout spontaneous broa sourdough fermentation. Presumptive yeasts, Lactobacillus and Bacillus were found to low levels after kneading, but became dominant by the end of regular (no aeration) fermentation. They apparently inhibit undesired rods and Staphylococcus, which were found to relatively high numbers after kneading. By 24 h of fermentation, lactic acid cocci accounted for an important fraction of biodiversity, and pH decreased significantly reaching about 4. 1. Aeration accelerated the microbial dynamics. In terms of total viable counts, such a long-term fermentation appeared to reach a quasistationary state. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Besides water, maize and {{rye flour}} {{are the main}} {{constituents}} of broa – a unique sourdough bread, manufactured following traditional protocols at the farm level in Portugal. Mother-dough, i. e., a piece of leavened dough kept aside from batch to batch under refrigeration conditions, constitutes the only starter culture used throughout breadmaking. Maize and rye flour, as well as mother-dough, were accordingly assayed for their microbiological profiles throughout storage time, to characterize the evolution in viability of the adventitious microorganisms: total viable counts, as well as viable yeasts, <b>molds,</b> gram-negative <b>rods,</b> gram-positive rods (endospore-forming and nonsporing) and gram-positive cocci (catalase+ and catalase−). In general, all microbial groups exhibited an outstanding resistance to storage, so use of mother-dough appears technologically effective in this form of breadmaking, and an appropriate storage of flour does not convey any important changes to their microbiological profile.

The molecular weight of Polyactive® was not influenced by processing, but γ-sterilization seemed to increase the {{weight average molecular weight}} (Mw). Mechanical properties of the rods and films decreased rapidly in hydrolytic conditions due to the hydrogel nature of the polymer, swelling and degradation. Mesh reinforcement increased the mechanical properties, but the components separated during soaking. In vitro the molecular weight of the rods and films started to decrease immediately, but the PEOT (or PEO) proportion remained relatively constant for 26 weeks. Macroscopically, all the wet devices remained intact, but fragmented on drying. Microscopically, topographical formations of polymer were found on the surfaces and small sodium-rich spots were precipitated onto and inside the polymer. Thermal measurements showed that polymer consisted of amorphous PEOT segments and both amorphous and crystalline PBT segments...|$|R

50|$|All products, men and supplies, {{as well as}} {{recoverable}} ore, travels up {{and down}} the shaft in a cage. When the hemp rope or chains broke, the cage would plummet uncontrolled {{to the bottom of the}} shaft, killing its occupants or destroying its load. Cages were open to the front and rear, with I-beams on both sides to support the floor. The outside of the I-beams slid through wooden guides {{up and down the}} shaft, top to bottom. Spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage, one each attached to the I-beams through bolts and lifted in the center. The outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous, round head at the end, notched with teeth <b>molded</b> into the <b>rods.</b> The weight of the cage being lifted, lifted the rods, released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.|$|R

Greater indentation resistance and energy absorption, as well as synclastic curvature, could lend auxetic materials well to protective sports equipment and clothing. Sheets of foam often form padding within protective equipment, but producing large homogenous auxetic foam samples is challenging. The aim of this work was to investigate techniques to fabricate large thin sheets of auxetic foam, to facilitate future production and testing of prototype sports equipment utilizing this material. A mold was developed to fabricate sheets of auxetic foam − with planar dimensions measuring 350 [*]×[*] 350 [*]mm − using the thermo-mechanical process. The <b>mold</b> utilized through-thickness <b>rods</b> to control lateral compression of foam. Sheets of auxetic foam measuring 10 [*]×[*] 350 [*]×[*] 350 [*]mmd were fabricated and characterized. Each sheet was cut into nine segments, with density measurements used to determine how evenly the foam had been compressed during fabrication. Specimens cut from corner and centre segments were subject to quasi-static extension up to 30 % to obtain stress versus strain relationships, with Digital Image Correlation used to determine Poisson's ratio. Specimens cut from the corner tended to have a marginally higher density, lower stiffness and more consistent negative Poisson's ratio compared to those from the centre, indicating some inconsistency in the conversion process. Future work could look to improve fabrication techniques for large thin homogenous sheets of auxetic foam...|$|R
