In our experiments, we used two types of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles: one consisted of ZnFe 2 O 4 (1) particles with higher moments, and the other consisted of ZnFe 2 O 4 (2) particles with lower moments. Comparing the birefringence and dichroism of the γ-Fe 2 O 3 –ZnFe 2 O 4 (1) and γ-Fe 2 O 3 –ZnFe 2 O 4 (2) binary ferrofluids, {{it was found that}} the <b>modulating</b> <b>action</b> of the ZnFe 2 O 4 (2) particle system with lower moments was larger than that of the ZnFe 2 O 4 (1) particle system with higher moments.

L-arginine (L-Arg, 2 mmol/L), a substrate of NO synthases, significantly suppressed the delayed rectifier K+ currents in hippocampal neurons, while its isomer D-arginine (D-Arg, 2 mmol/L) exerted no effect. Moreover, pretreatment with NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (0. 5 mmol/L) completely blocked the suppressing effect by L-Arg, indicating that L-Arg exerted its modulation by producing NO {{but not by}} itself.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{evaluate}} a topical treatment based on silymarin/methylsulfonilmethane (S-MSM) to improve erythematous-telangiectactic rosacea. METHODS: Forty-six patients affected by stage I-III rosacea entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects were treated for 1 month. Clinical and instrumental evaluations were done at baseline, after 10 and 20 days, {{and at the end}} of the study. Itching, stinging, erythema, and papules were investigated clinically as well as hydration and erythema instrumentally with capacitance and color measurements. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was observed in many clinical and instrumental parameters investigated (P < 0. 001). In particular, improvement of skin redness, papules, itching, hydration, and skin color occurred.

40|$|SummaryLoss of FMRP causes fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS), but {{the physiological}} functions of FMRP remain highly debatable. Here {{we show that}} FMRP regulates neurotransmitter release in CA 3 pyramidal neurons by <b>modulating</b> <b>action</b> potential (AP) duration. Loss of FMRP leads to excessive AP broadening during repetitive activity, enhanced presynaptic calcium influx, and elevated neurotransmitter release. The AP broadening defects caused by FMRP loss have a cell-autonomous presynaptic origin and can be acutely rescued in postnatal neurons. These presynaptic actions of FMRP are translation independent and are mediated selectively by BK channels via interaction of FMRP with BK channel’s regulatory β 4 subunits. Information-theoretical analysis demonstrates that loss of these FMRP functions causes marked dysregulation of synaptic information transmission. FMRP-dependent AP broadening {{is not limited to}} the hippocampus, but also occurs in cortical pyramidal neurons. Our results thus suggest major translation-independent presynaptic functions of FMRP that may have important implications for understanding FXS neuropathology...|$|E

The results show suppression of SCN neuronal activity by spontaneous behavior, the magnitude being dependent on the intensity, duration and type of behavioral activity. The suppression was moderate (32 % of circadian amplitude) for low-intensity behavior and considerable (59 %) for locomotor activity. Mild manipulation of the animals had reversed effects on the SCN indicating that different mechanisms are involved in the regulatory effect of spontaneous versus induced activity.

It {{was found that}} Cd 2 + induced both necrosis and apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent way. This cell injury involved dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, respiratory dysfunction and initial increase of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by its decrease after prolonged incubation. Inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid, and inhibitors of respiratory complex III, stigmatellin and antimycin A, but not inhibitor of complex I, rotenone, partly prevented necrosis evoked by exposure of the cells to Cd 2 +. Apoptosis of the cells was partly prevented by free radical scavengers and by preincubation with N-acetylcysteine. Stigmatellin, antimycin A and cyclosporin A also abolished Cd 2 +-induced increase in ROS generation.
