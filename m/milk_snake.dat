5|$|Some {{harmless}} <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and {{the deadly}} coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
25|$|Snakes present {{include the}} eastern hog-nosed snake, brown snake, common garter snake, eastern <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> and the {{northern}} ribbon snake. The only common reptiles and amphibians are various pond frogs, toads, salamanders, and small turtles.|$|E
500|$|More than 450 snakes {{were used}} for filming to {{represent}} thirty different species of snakes. The different species include a 19-foot Burmese python named Kitty (which the crew called Kong for film purposes), a scarlet kingsnake (the non-venomous double for the coral snake), a <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> to fill in for the taipan (which attacks the couple having sex), corn snakes, rattlesnakes, and mangrove snakes. About two-thirds of the snakes seen throughout the film were either animatronic or CGI. [...] The snakes that were real were mostly the non-venomous ones that are never seen attacking anyone. The scenes where someone is clearly bitten were often done with animation. [...] According to the DVD, all the snakes had production names, but only Scarface (an animated pit viper), Peanut (a cobra), and Kong are mentioned by name in the audio commentary. During filming, Samuel Jackson did not {{come into contact with}} any live snakes, due to a contract clause preventing snakes from being within [...] (25ft) of the actor. When the film was released in theaters, two live western diamondback rattlesnakes were released at a showing of the film on August 22, 2006, in Phoenix, Arizona. One snake had made its way into the lobby of the theater on its own, and another had been found in the parking lot. Nobody was harmed and the snakes were released back into the desert.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>snakes,</b> Andean <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> are carnivores. Young <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> mostly eat insects, while larger <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> eat small mammals, birds, eggs, amphibians, {{and other}} reptiles, {{including}} venomous snakes. Like most <b>snakes,</b> <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> {{only need to}} eat once every one or two weeks.|$|R
50|$|Across {{the wide}} range of this species, habitat varies. Typically, <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> live in forested regions; however, in some regions they can be located in open prairies. In various parts across its distribution, <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> often abide in rocky slopes.|$|R
50|$|Hatchlings black <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are between}} 12 and 16 inches in length. They are red, black, and white or yellow as hatchlings. When they are between 6 and 10 months of age, the black <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> {{will begin to}} change colors, and start to turn black as they grow to adulthood. Adult black <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> average between 48-76 inches (4 feet - 6 feet 4 inches), but some {{have been known to}} grow up to 7 feet in length.|$|R

2500|$|The Paulins Kill {{watershed}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of other animals. Other mammals include eastern chipmunk, [...] porcupine, black bear, striped skunk, river otter, and bobcat. Common northeastern American reptiles found there include snakes such as the American copperhead, [...] eastern diamondback rattlesnake, northern water snake, common garter snake and <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> and turtles, including the eastern box turtle, and common snapping turtle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{blue-footed booby}} lays {{one to three}} eggs in one nest at a time, {{although}} 80% of nests only contain two eggs. [...] Eggs are laid five days apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which results in a difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches {{four days before the}} other, so it receives a four-day head start in growth compared to its younger sibling. This asynchronous hatching serves many purposes. First, it spaces out the difficult time period in rearing during which newborn chicks are too feeble to accept regurgitated food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total brood loss to predators such as the <b>milk</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>snakes</b> grow 20 to 60 in long. They have {{smooth and}} shiny scales and their typical color pattern is {{alternating}} bands of red-black-yellow or white-black-red. However, red blotches instead of bands {{are seen in}} some populations. Some <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> have {{a striking resemblance to}} coral snakes and this mimicry (known as Batesian mimicry) likely scares away potential predators. While both <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> and coral snakes possess transverse bands of red, black and yellow, common mnemonics can be used to properly distinguish between the deadly coral snake and the harmless milk snake: ...|$|R
50|$|Honduran <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> adapt well to captivity due {{to their}} {{relative}} ease of care and docile nature, and their large size and brilliant colors make them impressive and attractive pets. Like all king <b>snakes</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>snakes,</b> they must be housed alone, apart from the breeding season, because they are cannibalistic.|$|R
2500|$|Examples of Batesian mimicry are {{the several}} species of {{butterflies}} that mimic the toxic Heliconid butterflies. Another butterfly mimic is the non-toxic great Mormon of Indonesia. Each female butterfly (regardless of her coloration) can produce one or more different female forms which mimic any of five other species of foul-tasting butterflies. Batesian mimicry {{is also found in}} the harmless <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> which mimics venomous coral snakes. Both snakes are marked with alternating yellow, red, and black bands, causing potential predators to avoid both. The snakes can often be distinguished by using an old saying: [...] "Red against yellow: kill a fellow. red against black: friend to Jack." [...] The deadly coral snake has bands in the order of red, yellow, black, while the innocuous species have the pattern of red, black, yellow (although there are exceptions).|$|E

50|$|Together with Hobart Muir Smith, he {{discovered}} in Mexico a new snake {{species in the}} genus Geophis. They also identified the southeastern canyon lizard subspecies of the canyon lizard in 1960. In 1966 he co-discovered the Texas scarlet snake. In 1968 he identified Cnemidophorus inornatus paululus, a subspecies of the little striped whiptail. He is also credited with {{the identification of the}} following <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> subspecies in 1978: Andean Milksnake, Conant's <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> Honduran <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> Sinaloan <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> Smith's <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> and Stuart's <b>milk</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{mountain}} dwellers, Andean <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> {{can tolerate}} much lower temperatures than most snakes. They {{spend much of}} the time in burrows or under logs, where they are safe from predators and from cold weather. <b>Milk</b> <b>snakes</b> often come out of their dens in the afternoon or evening to hunt.|$|R
5000|$|Pueblan <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> adapt well {{in captivity}} if kept between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, with a night time {{temperature}} drop of 5 to 10 degrees. Temperature control is important, as it maintains the animal's feeding response and digestion. Cages should be escape proof, and fresh water provided at all times. A hide box is necessary, since Pueblans {{are more comfortable}} in confined spaces. King <b>snakes</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> must be housed separately (except during the breeding season) because they are cannibalistic. Pueblan <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> are widely bred and very affordable, likely being the most common subspecies in captivity.|$|R

5000|$|Lampropeltis triangulum annulata, {{commonly}} known as the Mexican <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> is a nonvenomous species of <b>milk</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mexican <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> adapts well to captive care, and its smaller {{size and}} {{striking}} coloration {{can make it}} an attractive choice for a pet snake. They are normally docile, and not typically apt to bite or expel musk. The Mexican <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> while not rare in captivity, is less common than other particular Lampropeltis triangulum subspecies, despite being relatively common in its natural range. Consequently, and as a result, the Mexican <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> tends to be higher priced than more well-known subspecies, such as the Pueblan <b>milk</b> <b>snake.</b> The somewhat lesser frequency of these snakes in captivity is likely due to the Mexican milk snake's rather small clutch size of 4-10 eggs, which is low compared to other milk snakes, and also, as examples, the sheer popularity of the Sinaloan <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> and the Pueblan <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> among others, which outrival this particular subspecies in terms of recognition.|$|E
50|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the scarlet kingsnake intergraded with the Eastern <b>milk</b> <b>snake,</b> which produced a variation once named the Coastal Plains <b>milk</b> <b>snake</b> (Lampropeltis triangulum temporalis), {{but this is no}} longer recognized as a legitimate taxon.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike most nonvenomous snakes, {{which are}} mottled gray and brown for camouflage, Andean <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> are brilliantly colored (although adults are often duller than juveniles, having an almost dusky appearance) in red, yellow, and black. The {{white and red}} scales are {{frequently}} clearly tipped with black. It has white scales on its snout with black sutures and often {{a large amount of}} white on the cheeks. It has 24 to 32 red rings which may be broken up with black in the mid-dorsal section and the rings may not completely cross the venter. [...] These bright colors {{are similar to those of}} the coral snake, a venomous elapid (which includes cobras and mambas) that lives in the same areas as the <b>milk</b> <b>snakes.</b> Andean <b>milk</b> <b>snakes</b> use this bright coloration to fool potential predators into believing that they are also venomous, and too risky to eat.|$|R
