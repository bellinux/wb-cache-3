Among the tools used for metabolomic research, mass spectrometry {{is one of the}} most powerful tools. However, metabolomics by mass spectrometry always reveals a high number of unknown compounds which complicate in depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In principle, mass spectrometry can be utilized within strategies of de novo structure elucidation of small molecules, starting with the computation of the elemental composition of an unknown metabolite using accurate masses with errors Results High mass accuracy (95 % of false candidates.

Furthermore, the hydrogen concentration in the surface of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was larger than that of the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution. In the viewpoint of hydrogen concentration, there is a gradient of hydrogen concentration in the position from 50 to 100 μm {{from the surface of the}} cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen. In contrast, the hydrogen distributed homogeneously in the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution. Hence, it is likely that the hydrogen concentration within 50 μm from the surface of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was much larger than that of the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution. On the other hand, for the aging {{at room temperature for}} 24 h, the hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of the surface of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was smaller than that of the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution. Therefore, after aging at room temperature for 240 h, the dominant factor that influences the tensile strength of the specimens is probably the hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of the surface of the specimens.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiobjective MILP formulation for optimizing industrial water networks. By expressing balance equations {{in terms of}} partial mass flows instead of total mass flows and concentrations, and because the contaminant <b>mass</b> flow (<b>ppm)</b> is very small compared to the water mass flow (T. h- 1), the problem becomes linear. The integer variables {{are related to the}} interconnections into the network. The biobjective optimization of the fresh water flow rate at the network entrance and the water flow rate at regeneration unit inlets, parameterized by the number of interconnections, is carried out according to a lexicographic procedure. A monocontaminant network involving ten processes and one regeneration unit illustrates the approach. Even if the results are specific, the methodology guide can be applied to a large panel of networks. On the one hand, this example shows that the Pareto front is a straight line where each point is a feasible solution, when the number of connections is maximal (120). On the other hand, the Pareto front is reduced with the number of connections (11) and constituted by isolated points located mainly on a straight line with the same slope as for 120 connections, but no feasible solution exists between these points...|$|R
40|$|Setting {{appropriate}} bin sizes {{to aggregate}} hyphenated high-resolution mass spectrometry data, belonging to similar mass over charge (m/. z) channels, {{is vital to}} metabolite quantification and further identification. In a high-resolution mass spectrometer when <b>mass</b> accuracy (<b>ppm)</b> varies {{as a function of}} molecular mass, which usually is the case while reading m/. z from low to high values, it becomes a challenge to determine suitable bin sizes satisfying all m/. z ranges. Similarly, the chromatographic process within a hyphenated system, like any other controlled processes, introduces some process driven systematic behavior that ultimately distorts the mass chromatogram signal. This is especially seen in liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements where the gradient of the solvent and the washing step cycle-part of the chromatographic process, produce a mass chromatogram with a non-uniform baseline along the retention time axis. Hence prior to any automatic signal decomposition techniques like deconvolution, it is a equally vital to perform the baseline correction step for absolute metabolite quantification. This paper will discuss an instrument and process independent solution to the binning and the baseline correction problem discussed above, seen together, as an effective pre-processing step toward liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS) data deconvolution. © 2012 Elsevier B.

However, the total amount of hydrogen obtained in that study (Yokoyama et al. 2003 a) was the average value of the entire specimen. Thus, the distribution of absorbed hydrogen in Ni-Ti superelastic alloy immersed in 0.2 % APF solution has not yet been evaluated quantitatively, although the hydrogen distribution can influence the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of the alloy. It has been suggested that changes in the distribution and state of hydrogen due to aging at room temperature dominate the tensile properties of cathodically hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti superelastic alloy (Yokoyama et al. 2007). In addition, the cathodically hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti superelastic alloy was reported to contain diffusive hydrogen, hydride, hydrogen in a solid solution, and trapped hydrogen (Yokoyama et al. 2007).

For a quantitative discussion of the limits of deoxidation achievable by this technique, a thermodynamic investigation of the lanthanide-oxygen (Ln-O; Ln = La, Pr, Nd) solid solutions was conducted.

Both optical and electron microscopy were used to characterise the deformed microstructures. Fragmentation of the initial grain structure occurs mainly {{in the form of}} a dense, homogeneous network of low angle boundaries (LAB) delimiting subgrains of about 1 µm. The original grains are easily distinguishable and maintain a relatively equiaxed appearance even at larger strains. At room temperature, high angle boundaries (HAB) are observed within some of the initial grains, and not necessarily close to the grain boundaries. These HAB may be open or closed, and tend to align themselves at approximately 45 ° to the orthogonal axes, suggesting the presence of microshear bands and thus a heterogeneous deformation. Such bands of localised strain criss-cross as a result of different slip systems being activated from one pass to another. When the temperature is increased to 450 °C, grain boundary migration becomes significant owing to the lack of impurities that could otherwise provide a pinning effect. The resultant subgrain structure is coarsened to about 4 µm. Besides, the enhancement of recovery at higher temperatures also appears to discourage the generation of HAB by dislocation accumulation processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{demulsification}} {{mechanism of}} asphaltene-stabilized water-in-toluene emulsions by an ethylene-oxide-propylene oxide (EO-PO) based polymeric demulsifier was studied. Demulsification efficiency {{was determined by}} bottle tests and correlated to the physicochemical properties of asphaltene interfacial films after demulsifier addition. From bottle tests and droplet coalescence experiments, the demulsifier showed an optimal performance at 2. 3 <b>ppm</b> (<b>mass</b> basis) in toluene. At high concentrations, the demulsification performance deteriorated due to the intrinsic stabilizing capacity of the demulsifier, which was attributed to steric repulsion between water droplets. Addition of demulsifier was shown to soften the asphaltene film (i. e., reduce the viscoelastic moduli of asphaltene films) under both shear and compressional interfacial deformations. Study of the macrostructures and the chemical composition of asphaltene film at the toluene-water interface after demulsifier addition demonstrated gradual penetration of the demulsifier into the asphaltene film. Demulsifier penetration in the asphaltene film changed the asphaltene interfacial mobility and morphology, as probed with Brewster angle and atomic force microscopy...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{accurate}} liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-visible (LC-UV-Vis), LC-mass spectrometry (MS) and LC-MS-MS {{analysis of the}} photo-degradation products of crystal violet (CV) is reported. CV is a light fugitive early synthetic dye which had a widespread diffusion into the market starting {{from the end of}} the XIX century and was used among others by V. Van Gogh and P. Gauguin in their writings, drawings or paintings. On-line photodiode array detector enabled simultaneous UV-Vis spectra acquisition. Many degradation compounds were identified through their exact <b>mass</b> (2 <b>ppm</b> accuracy) and MS-MS technique. In particular, all CV demethylated products, demethylated Michler’s ketone and particularly some compounds that most likely contain oxygen, such as N-oxides, were found. Fragmentation products are all justified by the proposed fragmentation scheme, in term of precursor exact mass and isotopic profile, characteristic losses in fragmentation and rebuilt structure formula. In particular, we hypothesized the presence of N-imido oxides and hydroxylamine derivates, never reported before, together with the demethylated derivatives of the studied dyes. All these compounds, although at trace level in our samples, contribute to the discoloration and fading of works of arts made with CV. In particular, demethylation of CV by UV light leads to formation of compounds absorbing at shorter wavelengths than CV (blue shift) or no-absorbing in visible range (yellow-colourless) with an overall effect that may appear reddish-brown. This phenomenon justifies drawings appearing grey or brown on aged yellowed paper, when CV-based inks or paints were used. The final aim was to better characterize the photo-degradation of early synthetic dyes (in particular of CV) and to gain a better insight into the discoloration and fading of purple ink strokes made of CV...|$|R
30|$|All the {{chemicals}} and reagents {{were obtained from}} Sigma (Germany) and CDH (India) and were recrystallized/redistilled as necessary. Melting points were determined by open capillary tube method and are uncorrected. Purity of the compounds were checked on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates precoated with silica gel G using solvent system ethyl acetate: petroleum ether (1) (3 : 7 v/v) and benzene: methanol (2) (2 : 1 v/v). The spots were visualized under iodine vapours and UV light. IR spectra were recorded using KBr on a FTIR Shimadzu 8400 S IR spectrophotometer (Japan). A JEOL AL 300 FTNMR 300 MHz spectrometer was used to acquire 1 H NMR spectra with DMSO as solvent and tetra methyl silane (TMS) as internal standard. Chemical shift values are expressed in δ <b>ppm.</b> <b>Mass</b> spectra were obtained with a VG 70 - 70 H mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Perkin Elmer model 240 -C apparatus. The results of the elemental analysis (C, H, N) are within ± 0.4 % of the calculated amounts.|$|R
