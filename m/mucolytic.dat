40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{secretions}} in the {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) airways contains {{high concentrations of}} polymers, including the respiratory mucins and varying amounts of DNA and actin, the debris of an aggressive neutrophilic inflammatory response to infection. Physical and chemical interactions between these polymers contribute to the viscoelastic nature of a material {{that is hard to}} clear without the use of <b>mucolytics.</b> Secretions retained in the CF airway not only restrict airflow and invite infection, but also act as a barrier to the delivery of inhaled drugs and gene therapy vectors to the underlying airway epithelium. The aim of this investigation was to develop a simple, sensitive, assay to measure the diffusion of nanospheres the size of liposomal gene therapy vectors through CF sputum, and to model the polymer interactions that limit diffusion and the diffusion-enhancing activity of <b>mucolytics.</b> METHODS: The diffusion of 200 nm fluorescent carboxylated nanospheres through CF sputum was investigated using a diffusion assay based on the micro-Boyden chamber. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to visualise and measure the pore diameter in CF sputum. The effect of the <b>mucolytics</b> deoxyribonuclease (DNase), N-acetylcysteine and gelsolin on the diffusion of nanospheres though synthetic biogels comprising mixtures of DNA, mucin and F-actin was also investigated. RESULTS: CF sputum significantly retarded the diffusion of 200 nm nanospheres. Pore diameter in CF sputum was highly variable, with a mean greater than 200 nm. At concentrations found in the CF airway, DNA (1 - 10 mg/ml) and mucin (25 - 50 mg/ml) also significantly reduced the diffusion of nanospheres. The barrier effects of DNA and mucin were not additive, and the additional presence of F-actin (5 mg/ml) did not influence diffusion of the nanospheres. However, actin (5 mg/ml) completely inhibited the ability of DNase (2. 9 microg/ml) and N-acetylcysteine (5 mM) to enhance diffusion. The activity of the <b>mucolytics,</b> DNase and N-acetylcysteine, was not restored by the addition of the actin depolymerising agent gelsolin (250 nM). CONCLUSION: Actin does not contribute to the barrier properties of CF sputum, but is a key determinant of the ability of <b>mucolytics</b> to enhance drug diffusion through synthetic and biological mucus...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibiotics, antitussives and <b>mucolytics</b> are {{commonly}} used in asthma, despite limited evidence for their effectiveness. The correlates of use for these medication classes in asthma were identified. METHODS: Asthma patients aged 18 - 50 who were regular customers of pharmacies were included in an observational study. Patients completed a questionnaire, which was complemented by computerised pharmacy records of previously dispensed medications. Users of each drug class were compared to non-users in terms of demographics, asthma characteristics and management. RESULTS: Among 886 patients (mean age: 37; 55 % females), 63. 2 %, 55. 8 % and 27. 2 %, respectively, were users of antibiotics, <b>mucolytics</b> and antitussives during the previous 12 months. In multivariate analysis, dispensing of > 2 units of oral corticosteroids was the major correlate of receiving antibiotics (OR= 5. 47; 95 % CI=[3. 00 - 9. 97]), <b>mucolytics</b> (OR= 3. 93; 95 % CI=[2. 38 - 6. 50]) and antitussives (OR= 1. 86; 95 % CI=[1. 18 - 2. 94]). Compared to well-controlled patients, the probability of receiving antibiotics was significantly higher for poorly controlled patients (OR= 2. 01; 95 % CI=[1. 28 - 3. 15]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these drugs are mainly used during asthma exacerbations. A {{better understanding of the}} use of co-medication in asthma is required...|$|R

50|$|Erdosteine is a <b>mucolytic.</b> Specifically it is a thiol {{derivative}} {{developed for}} the treatment of chronic obstructive bronchitis, including acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Erdosteine contains two blocked sulfhydryl groups which are released following first-pass metabolism. The three active metabolites exhibit <b>mucolytic</b> and free radical scavenging activity.

40|$|BackgroundCough {{is often}} {{distressing}} {{for patients with}} pneumonia. Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (<b>mucolytics</b> or cough suppressants). These might provide relief in reducing cough severity, but suppression of the cough mechanism might impede airway clearance and cause harm. ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy of OTC cough medications {{as an adjunct to}} antibiotics in children and adults with pneumonia. Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January week 2, 2014), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1980 to January 2014), CINAHL (2009 to January 2014), LILACS (2009 to January 2014) and Web of Science (2009 to January 2014). Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults comparing any type of OTC cough medication with placebo, or control medication, with cough as an outcome and where the cough is secondary to acute pneumonia. Data collection and analysisWe independently selected trials for inclusion. We extracted data from these studies, assessed them for methodological quality without disagreement and analyzed them using standard methods. Main resultsThere are no new trials to include in this review update. Previously, four studies with a total of 224 participants were included; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data. Three different <b>mucolytics</b> (bromhexine, ambroxol, neltenexine) were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data. They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 2 ̆ 7 not cured or not improved 2 ̆ 7 for <b>mucolytics.</b> A secondary outcome of 2 ̆ 7 not cured 2 ̆ 7 was reduced (odds ratio (OR) for children 0. 36, 95...|$|R
