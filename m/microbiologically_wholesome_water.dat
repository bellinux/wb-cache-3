There are only a few chemicals that can lead to health problems after a single exposure, except through massive accidental contamination of a drinking water supply (WHO 2006). The main problems associated with chemical components of drinking water arise primarily from their ability to cause adverse health effects after prolonged periods of exposure, especially in the developing countries can be traced to lack of safe and <b>wholesome</b> <b>water</b> supply (WHO 2004).

[...] To augment the existing water supply in the city Mohammed Adil Shah constructed Jahan Begum Lake (Begum Talab) in the south of Bijapur. This Lake fed the southern and eastern sides of the city. Thus water reached every comer of the capital. In addition, to supplement the water needs of the people in and around, the Sultans and nobles constructed big and small wells. Captain Sykes who visited Bijapur in 1819 reports, there were 700 wells (Boudis) with steps and 300 wells (Kuans or small wells) without steps within the walls of Bijapur.

It also commits the operators on drinking water supply to the internal control of drinking water by {{the principles of the}} HACCP system. HACCP is an internationally established preventive system for ensuring food safety that specifies control methods and recognizes the critical control points. The materials in contact with drinking water pose a potential health risk to the <b>wholesome</b> drinking <b>water</b> and thus indirectly also to human health, because their decomposition processes may lead to the migration between the material and the water. Although the first polymeric materials were produced {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, we still place them amongst newer materials.

Material and Methods: In the present study 'twenty' drinking water samples (15 water bottles and 5 sachets) of different brands purchased randomly, were evaluated to access the water quality {{on the basis of}} different bacteriological parameters. Result: Out of twenty, 50 % samples were found unsatisfactory in standard plate count. Psychrophillic, coliforms, E. coli and staphylococcal counts revealed that 25 %, 45 %, 20 %, and 5 % samples respectively were found unfit for human consumption as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) of drinking water. On the basis of results of overall microbiological assessment 55 % of samples proved to be unfit for consumption. All brands of water sachet (100 %) had high coliforms count which indicates faecal contamination. Amongst those sachets two brands (40 %) had presence of E. coli and all the sachet water brands fell below drinking water standards while out of fifteen brands of bottled water 6 samples contained higher microbiological value hence unfit for human consumption. Conclusion: Local brands of packaged drinking water were found unfit for human condumption.

Classical western water treatment tedmologies are unsuitable, and often unsustainable, interventions {{due to the lack of}} infrastructure and the prohibitive cost of installing, operating and maintaining such systems. A locally produced simple filtration system, developed from low-tedmology ceramics and operated at the point-of-use, represents one of the most promising approaches for an effective and sustainable solution. Filters fabricated using simple clays, tempered with common waste materials and produced using techniques that are ubiquitous to local artisans were found to be capable of removing bacteria with extremely high efficiency (average removal rates > 99. 98 %). Considerations for materials (clay and temper), manufacturing (moulding, drying and firing) and operation (duration, regeneration and flow conditions) were made to ensure that the optimum balance of simplicity and performance was achieved. Simple system adaptations were made to the basic filtration units by incorporating low-technology adsorbents capable of removing other contaminants of concern, such as arsenic and heavy metals. The end product is a cheap and simple ceramic material, suitable for use in household filtration systems, which allows the effective removal of bacteria, associated pathogens, toxic pollutants and metals from contaminated water, and notably, can be produced and operated without the need for imported skills or materials.

60|$|Again, in how {{superior}} a port or figure (as we {{now call}} it) do our tradesmen live, to what the middling gentry either do or can support! An ordinary tradesman now, not in the city only, but in the country, shall spend more money by the year, than a gentleman {{of four or five}} hundred pounds a-year can do, and shall increase and lay up every year too, whereas the gentleman shall at the best stand stock still, just where he began, nay, perhaps decline; and as for the lower gentry, from a hundred pounds a-year to three hundred, or thereabouts, though they are often as proud and high in their appearance as the other--as to them, I say, a shoemaker in London shall keep a better house, spend more money, clothe his family better, and yet grow rich too. It is evident where the difference lies; an estate's a pond, but a trade's a spring: the first, if it keeps full, and the <b>water</b> <b>wholesome,</b> by the ordinary supplies and drains from the neighbouring grounds, it is well, and it is all that is expected; but the other is an inexhausted current, which not only fills the pond, and keeps it full, but is continually running over, and fills all the lower ponds and places about it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{system in}} Rome was copied in all provincial {{towns and cities}} of the Roman Empire, and even down to villas that could afford the plumbing. Roman {{citizens}} came to expect high standards of hygiene, and the army was also well provided with latrines and bath houses, or thermae. Aqueducts were used everywhere in the empire not just to supply drinking water for private houses but to supply other needs such as irrigation, public fountains, and thermae. Indeed, many of the provincial aqueducts survive in working order to the present day, although modernized and updated. Of the eleven ancient aqueducts serving Rome, eight of them entered Rome {{close to each other}} on the Esquiline Hill. Also, the first aqueduct was the Aqua Appia built in 312 BC by the censor Appius. [...] Other aqueducts of importance to Roman sanitation was the Aqua Marcia built between 144-140 BC, which provided large amounts of quality water to Rome. [...] One Aqueduct with some major importance to Rome was Traiana, which tapped from the clear springs of the northern and western slopes above lake Bracciano. It is said that the “Romans fully appreciated the importance of plentiful and <b>wholesome</b> supply of <b>water,</b> for domestic purposes to health of the Community. It was stated by Amulree that for 441 years after the building of Rome, it depended on water from the Tiber for drinking and other domestic purposes, but in 312 BC Appius Claudius Crassus provide Rome with water from the Springs of the Alban hills and brought to consumers by the means of Aqueducts. [...] The Amulree notes state that this practice is in line with the teachings of Hippocrates: that stagnant water should be refused, not the spring water from the hills or rain water.|$|R
