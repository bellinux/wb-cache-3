5|$|The Exposition Universelle (1867) (Paris Exhibition) {{devoted a}} stand to the <b>metric</b> system and by 1875, {{two thirds of}} the European {{population}} and close to half the world's population had adopted the <b>metric</b> system. By 1872, the only principal European countries not to have adopted the <b>metric</b> system were Russia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|According to the DTC <b>metric,</b> White should {{capture the}} rook because that leads {{immediately}} {{to a position}} which will certainly win (DTC = 1), {{but it will take}} two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM <b>metric,</b> White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.|$|E
5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the <b>metric</b> system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of <b>metric</b> units – for example, the livre metrique (<b>metric</b> pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (<b>metric</b> fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century the <b>metric</b> system of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a <b>metric</b> system. Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the <b>metric</b> system. There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the Commonwealth followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Even though Congress {{set up a}} {{framework}} {{for the use of}} the <b>metric</b> system in the nineteenth century, the United States continues to use US customary units, based on English measure passed by parliament under the reign of Queen Anne in 1706, for most purposes apart from science and medicine. In Puerto Rico, <b>metric</b> units are widely used due to its Spanish colonial history.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational <b>metric</b> systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or <b>metric</b> slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced the <b>metric</b> system, but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre {{became the}} duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted the <b>metric</b> system as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the <b>metric</b> system in 1861.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} <b>metric</b> system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the <b>metric</b> units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the <b>metric</b> system compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. <b>Metric</b> Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the <b>Metric</b> Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the <b>metric</b> measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States <b>Metric</b> Board (USMB).|$|E
5|$|Station model plots use {{a mixture}} of <b>metric</b> and Imperial units {{depending}} on the map's location and what is being shown. Surface maps in the United States primarily use Imperial units, such as inches, degrees Fahrenheit, and knots. Most of the world, however, uses <b>metric</b> measurements for everything but wind speed, which is shown in knots.|$|E

The main {{discharge}} ports were located in North America, Europe, and Japan with 537.7, 438.4, and 215.0 million <b>metric</b> tons of cargo discharged in these regions.|$|E
5|$|The only {{additional}} {{countries that}} {{rank in the}} top 20 where squashes are native are Cuba, which ranks 14th with 347,082 <b>metric</b> tons, and Argentina, which ranks 17th, with 326,900 <b>metric</b> tons. In addition to being the 4th largest producer of squashes in the world, the United States is the world's largest importer of squashes, importing 271,614 <b>metric</b> tons in 2011, 95 percent of that from Mexico. Within the United States, the states producing the largest amounts are Florida, New York, California, and North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski <b>metric.</b> As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The <b>metric</b> tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski <b>metric</b> of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian <b>metric.</b> Furthermore, each Riemannian <b>metric</b> is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the <b>metric</b> is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} the <b>metric</b> system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the <b>metric</b> system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the <b>metric</b> system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the <b>metric</b> system.|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the <b>metric</b> system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the <b>metric</b> system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the <b>metric</b> system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the <b>metric</b> system or that were considering changing to the <b>metric</b> system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

25|$|<b>Metric</b> {{spaces are}} an {{important}} class of topological spaces where distances can be assigned a number called a <b>metric.</b> Having a <b>metric</b> simplifies many proofs, {{and many of the}} most common topological spaces are <b>metric</b> spaces.|$|E

25|$|Conversely given a <b>metric</b> on U a {{coordinate}} {{change on}} U making the <b>metric</b> conformally {{equivalent to the}} <b>metric</b> is a diffeomorphism h of U such that the original <b>metric</b> is a positive smooth function times the induced Euclidean metric; the new coordinates are called isothermal coordinates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metric</b> {{spaces are}} an {{important}} class of topological spaces where a real, non-negative distance, also called a <b>metric,</b> can be defined on pairs of points in the set.

25|$|Every <b>metric</b> space (M, d) can be {{considered}} as a uniform space. Indeed, since a <b>metric</b> is a fortiori a pseudometric, the pseudometric definition furnishes M with a uniform structure. A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the setsThis uniform structure on M generates the usual <b>metric</b> space topology on M. However, different <b>metric</b> spaces can have the same uniform structure (trivial example is provided by a constant multiple of a <b>metric).</b> This uniform structure produces also equivalent definitions of uniform continuity and completeness for <b>metric</b> spaces.|$|E
25|$|Dewey {{also served}} once again as its secretary. He edited the Bureau's {{official}} publication, the <b>Metric</b> Bulletin (later called <b>Metric</b> Advocate), first issued in July 1876. Later {{in his life}} he was member of the Advisory Board of the All-America Standards Council (a California-based organization that promoted metrication for all countries in the Americas) and he functioned as member of the Advisory Board {{and chairman of the}} <b>Metric</b> Education Committee in the American <b>Metric</b> Association (today the U.S. <b>Metric</b> Association).|$|E

25|$|In 1971 the National Bureau of Standards {{completed}} a three-year {{study of the}} impact of increasing worldwide <b>metric</b> use on the U.S. The study concluded with a report to Congress entitled A <b>Metric</b> America– A Decision Whose Time Has Come. Since then <b>metric</b> use has increased in the U.S., principally in the manufacturing and educational sectors. Public Law 93-380, enacted 21 August 1974, states that it is the policy of the U.S. to encourage educational agencies and institutions to prepare students to use the <b>metric</b> system of measurement with ease and facility {{as a part of the}} regular education program. On 23 December 1975, President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94-168, the <b>Metric</b> Conversion Act of 1975. This act declares a national policy of coordinating the increasing use of the <b>metric</b> system in the U.S. It established a U.S. <b>Metric</b> Board whose functions as of 1 October 1982 were transferred to the Dept of Commerce, Office of <b>Metric</b> Programs, to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the <b>metric</b> system.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of the covariant derivative does not use the <b>metric</b> in space. However, for each <b>metric</b> there is a unique torsion-free covariant derivative called the Levi-Civita connection such that the covariant derivative of the <b>metric</b> is zero.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, Chebyshev {{distance}} (or Tchebychev distance), maximum <b>metric,</b> or L∞ <b>metric</b> is a <b>metric</b> defined on a {{vector space}} where the distance between two vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension.

25|$|Some sources now {{identify}} Liberia as <b>metric,</b> and {{the government}} of Myanmar has stated that the country would metricate with a goal of completion by 2019. Both Myanmar and Liberia are substantially <b>metric</b> countries, trading internationally in <b>metric</b> units. Visiting advocates of metrication have stated that they use <b>metric</b> units for many things internally with exceptions such as old petrol pumps in Myanmar, calibrated in British Imperial gallons. These and other countries have adopted <b>metric</b> measures to some degree through international trade and standardization for example, Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011. The United States mandated the acceptance of the <b>metric</b> system in 1866 for commercial and legal proceedings, without displacing their customary units.
