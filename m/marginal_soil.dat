In the present study Sida hermaphrodita {{was used to evaluate}} its potential as an energy crop to be grown on a <b>marginal</b> sandy <b>soil</b> in combination with a fertilization using digestate from biogas production.

In Morocco, alfalfa is usually grown in <b>marginal</b> <b>soils</b> of arid and semi-arid regions frequently affected by drought, extremes of temperature and soil pH, soil salinity and heavy metals, which affect biological nitrogen fixing ability of rhizobia and {{productivity of the}} host. This study examines phenotypic diversity for tolerance to the above stresses and genotypic diversity at Repetitive Extragenic Pallindromic DNA regions of Sinorhizobium nodulating alfalfa, sampled from <b>marginal</b> <b>soils</b> of arid and semi-arid regions of Morocco. Results Rsa I digestion of PCR amplified 16 S rDNA of the 157 sampled isolates, assigned 136 isolates as S. meliloti and the rest as S. medicae. Further phenotyping of these alfalfa rhizobia for tolerance to the environmental stresses revealed a large degree of variation: 55. 41 %, 82. 16 %, 57. 96 % and 3. 18 % of the total isolates were tolerant to NaCl (> 513 mM), water stress (- 1. 5 MPa), high temperature (40 °C) and low pH (3. 5), respectively. Sixty-seven isolates of S. meliloti and thirteen isolates of S. medicae that were tolerant to salinity were also tolerant to water stress. Most of the isolates of the two species showed tolerance to heavy metals (Cd, Mn and Zn) and antibiotics (chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline). The phenotypic clusters observed by the cluster analysis clearly showed adaptations of the S. meliloti and S. medicae strains to the multiple stresses.

It can be concluded that Ifapet AMF inoculum produced by using simple method to improve crop productivity and increased <b>marginal</b> <b>soil</b> fertility. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Environmental and {{economic}} factors are encouraging research into biofuel technologies. One such technology is gaining interest because of its potential to utilize waste streams as well as low quality biomass difficult to process into ethanol. This technology is known as pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the burning of biomass in a low oxygen environment. Biochar is a byproduct of the pyrolysis process. Biochar has shown potential to improve plant growth in <b>marginal</b> <b>soils.</b> Little research has looked at the effect of growing root crops in soils amended with biochar, or on how biochar might affect the post-harvest quality of root crops like carrots...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of the effective utilization of the available crop (including wild relative) diversity in plant breeding to develop food crops with improved nutritive value, with higher yields while growing on more <b>marginal</b> <b>soils</b> and with increased ability to withstand more extreme climates, pests and diseases. Computational methodologies required to bring the gathered data together effectively and their storage in an appropriate format are presented and examples on how plant breeders can use data interoperability strategies to improve their research and the importance of the gene bank community in this process are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The plant grows vigorously even in <b>marginal</b> <b>soils</b> and it competes {{well with}} weeds. It is well-adapted to high-altitude {{subsistence}} agriculture, and gives high yields; 30 tonnes per hectare are yielded at {{a height of}} 3000 metres, but up to 70 tons per hectare have been produced under research conditions. Its extraordinary resistance to insect, nematode and bacterial pests is attributed {{to high levels of}} isothiocyanates. Although mashua is fully domesticated, it can persist in wild vegetation because of its aggressive growth and robustness. In Colombia, it is planted as a companion crop to repel pests in potato fields.|$|R
