500|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company [...] thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. [...] I didn't have the confidence {{to say no to}} some of the things [...] suggested". Davey claimed not to [...] "know my arse from <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> when I signed for them" [...] and did not like performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as [...] "very talented—far more so than [...] Hayes" [...] but regretted that she had [...] "failed to find an audience for her fine debut Something Ilk".|$|E
2500|$|Phillips {{explained}} when I (Lightoller) {{said that}} I did not recollect any Mesaba report: [...] "I {{just put the}} message under a paper weight at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> just until I squared up what I was doing before sending it to the Bridge." [...] That delay proved fatal and was the main contributory cause {{to the loss of}} that magnificent ship and hundreds of lives. Had I as Officer of the Watch, or the Captain, become aware of the peril lying so close ahead and not instantly slowed down or stopped, we should have been guilty of culpable and criminal negligence.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard my}} name spoken, {{and turned to}} find White at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
60|$|I raised {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> and, {{in the light}} of the smoking lamp, saw that he was shaking all over.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must sit up straight. I mustn't sprawl with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on the table. It is only common, vulgar people behave that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{ties and}} {{ballasts}} leave me, <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> rest in sea-gaps, [...] I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents, [...] I am afoot with my vision.|$|R
60|$|I had {{got as far}} as {{that when}} {{there was a kind of}} gasping cry at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{seized on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and hobbled through the shop {{as fast as}} possible; the young ladies {{following}} her, laughing.|$|E
60|$|It was Captain Hannock's voice. I {{started in}} alarm, {{and found the}} skipper of the Spitfire close at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Serious health {{concerns}} played {{a large part}} in Hardwick's decision to retire. [...] "Nerves were getting compressed through various forms. My hands were going numb during training camp {{for weeks at a}} time. I was losing feeling in my fingers up through <b>my</b> <b>elbows.</b> I was having a bunch of stingers. On a daily basis, my hands were asleep, <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> were burning, and I was losing a normalcy to life. It became reckless to continue playing," [...] and vomiting regularly before and during games.|$|R
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to my desk, and I leaned forward, with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on the table, the finger-tips {{of one hand}} in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|R
60|$|I smiled enigmatically {{and spread}} <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> {{as if to}} begin writing again. But this grim, abject, specious, subservient, burr-like wreck of a man would not be shaken off. His {{forehead}} suddenly became shiningly moist.|$|R
60|$|He {{never came}} out of the entrance, of that I was certain; yet at the end of several minutes he chuckled at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> Again I ran after him, and again he ran into the cave; but this time I stopped at the mouth. I dropped back a short {{distance}} and watched. He did not come out, yet, as before, he chuckled at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and was chased by me a third time into the cave.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ayre Engliss?" [...] said a {{voice at}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> I almost bounded, so {{unexpected}} was the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} round at my corner. I sat there quite immovable, with my tracts at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on my lap.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} {{still for}} a time in the dark--silent; almost invisible. All at once he pinned <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> to <b>my</b> sides. I felt utterly powerless in his grip, and his voice, whispering in my ear, vibrated.|$|R
60|$|Then Quilla and {{the lady}} Mira came forward and, placing their hands beneath <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> {{assisted}} me {{to climb out of}} that balsa, which I think was the strangest way that ever a shipwrecked wanderer came to land.|$|R
6000|$|I {{am always}} quite {{straightforward}} when I am {{dealing with a}} client who means business. I pushed aside the litter of papers in front of me, leaned <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> upon <b>my</b> desk, rested my chin in my hands, and said briefly: ...|$|R
60|$|Gom. Ay, {{and a man}} had need of them, Don Pedro; {{for here}} are the two old seducers, a wife and priest,--that's Eve and the serpent,--at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do they? I was {{not aware}} of that. I struck <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> last week so hard against the door of my aunt's mansion that I feel the ache now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{is another}} {{compliment}} by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer. He is writing four octavo volumes about me, {{and he has}} been at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> two and one-half years.|$|E
60|$|I {{had lost}} myself with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on <b>my</b> knees {{and my head}} in my hands, but I heard the words distinctly. I heard also the silence which ensued. I sat up and took the {{responsibility}} of the answer on myself.|$|R
50|$|I woke {{with this}} marble {{head in my}} hands;It {{exhausts}} <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> and I don't know where to put it down.It was falling into the dream as I {{was coming out of}} the dream.So our life became one and {{it will be very difficult}} for it to separate again.|$|R
6000|$|... “And {{whom have}} I {{to thank for}} this kindness?” I asked, when I stood {{completely}} arrayed, a tiny boy’s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves of which reached just below <b>my</b> <b>elbows.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the 'Bell,' sir, {{where we}} {{generally}} put up," [...] remarked Reynolds, at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> [...] "You {{will have some}} lunch, sir, before {{we go into the}} town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's her eccentricity. We {{all have}} them; and she amuses the Prince. Now, nephew, keep close at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> {{and have your}} eyes open and your mouth shut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Por Dios!' I {{heard the}} {{sergeant}} muttering at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> 'I shall shoot {{him through the}} head now, {{and get rid of}} that trouble. He is a condemned man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Sebald. [...] Morning? [...] It {{seems to}} me a night with a sun added. [...] Where's dew, where's freshness? That bruised plant, I bruised [...] In getting through the lattice yestereve, [...] Droops as it did. See, here's <b>my</b> <b>elbow's</b> mark [...] 35 [...] I' the dust o' the sill.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{whole world}} ain't {{a bit too}} big for me to spread <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> in, I can tell you--what's your name--Bessie--let alone a dam' parlour in a hutch. Marry! He wants me to marry and settle! And as likely as not he has looked out the girl too--dash my soul! And {{do you know the}} Judy, may I ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! that shews you're a--I mean, d'ye see, {{that the}} {{difficulty}} lies here, <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> are lashed so fast {{to my side}} that I can't use them to prop me up, but if Poopy will roll {{down the hill to}} my side, and shove her pretty shoulder under my back when I raise it, perhaps I may succeed in getting up. What say you, Kickup?" ...|$|R
60|$|I now raised {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> and putting {{my hand to}} my forehead, found {{that it had been}} cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.|$|E
6000|$|I had fished on {{for some}} hour or two; Claude had long since {{disappeared}} among the hills; I fancied myself miles from any human being, when a voice at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> startled me ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the mate}} moaning at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> He was thunderstruck, {{and as it}} were {{deprived}} of the moral support of his whiskers. He clapped his hands and absolutely cried out, [...] "Lost!" ...|$|E
60|$|After breakfast Jack and I {{retired to}} my room, where, the weather being {{unfavourable}} for our fishing excursion, I went {{all over it}} again in detail. After that I sent Jack off to amuse himself as he chose, and, seizing a quire of foolscap, mended a pen, squared <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> and began to write this remarkable account {{of the reason why}} I did not become a sailor.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{answered}} me, {{not even}} a stir behind the door. Jacobus's house might have been made empty {{for me to make}} myself at home in. I did not call again. I had become aware of a great discouragement. I was mentally jaded, morally dejected. I turned to the garden again, sitting down with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> spread on the low balustrade, and took my head in my hands.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{only were}} my wrists bound, but the lasso had been wrapped round <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> holding them {{close to my}} body. Turning on my side, I found that I could not reach the knife--not by several inches. This was a bitter disappointment. I {{strained}} and heaved. In my effort to lift my body sidewise I pressed my face into the gravel. [...] "Hurry, Ken, hurry!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "Somebody's coming!" ...|$|R
