5|$|The Maryland Geological Survey {{was formed}} in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency {{determined}} that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of <b>macadam</b> roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long <b>macadam</b> roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{influenced}} many works {{starting with}} those of Wallace's contemporaries. The novelist Joseph Conrad used it as source material for some of his novels, including Almayer's Folly, An Outcast of the Islands, and The Rescue. Commentators have suggested it had a particularly profound influence on Lord Jim, crediting it with among other things {{the inspiration for the}} character Stein the entomologist. Conrad's assistant Richard Curle wrote that The Malay Archipelago was Conrad's favourite bedside book; Conrad refers directly to what he calls Alfred Wallace's famous book on the Malay Archipelago in The Secret Agent. In his short story, Neil <b>MacAdam,</b> W. Somerset Maugham has the title character read The Malay Archipelago while travelling to Borneo, and its influence can be felt in the story's description of that island.|$|E
5|$|With {{the road}} leading from Albany {{northwest}} to Schenectady having been already {{established as a}} turnpike (the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike) in 1797, an all-turnpike route over good quality roads was now available from Albany to Canandaigua. The western extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo soon followed suit and also became an improved <b>Macadam</b> toll road, the Ontario and Genesee Turnpike, in 1805. The Seneca Road Company was authorized {{to create a more}} northerly alternate route of the Seneca Turnpike in 1806. This branch left the original turnpike east of Seneca Falls and crossed more level terrain through Elbridge, Geddes, and Fayetteville before rejoining the old path at Chittenango. As the city of Syracuse developed, traffic patterns changed and the northern branch route became more heavily used than the original road.|$|E

5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A <b>macadam</b> road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered by the state and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a <b>macadam</b> surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|In May 1911, the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{passed the}} Sproul Roads Act, which created the Pennsylvania state road system {{and allowed the}} state to take over turnpikes. Baltimore Pike was {{designated}} Legislative Route 42 from the Maryland state line northwest to the borough of Gettysburg. The Sproul Roads Act was challenged as being unconstitutional, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the legislation on June 27, 1913. The state took over the Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike and abolished tolls the next day, {{just in time for}} the March to Gettysburg ahead of the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. Baltimore Pike was improved as a <b>macadam</b> road from the state line to Gettysburg by 1916. The highway from the state line to US 15 at the intersection of Baltimore Street and Steinwehr Avenue (then Emmitsburg Road) was designated the northernmost part of US 140 in 1927. US 140 was widened and resurfaced with concrete from Gettysburg to Littlestown between 1941 and 1943. The remainder of the highway through Littlestown to the Maryland state line was widened and resurfaced with asphalt between 1943 and 1953. US 140's interchange with modern US 15 was completed when the thentwo-lane US 15 bypass opened in June 1963, immediately before the centennial of the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

25|$|An equal {{mixture of}} two equally bright colors will not {{generally}} {{lie on the}} midpoint of that line segment. In more general terms, a distance on the CIE xy chromaticity diagram does not correspond {{to the degree of}} difference between two colors. In the early 1940s, David <b>MacAdam</b> studied the nature of visual sensitivity to color differences, and summarized his results in the concept of a <b>MacAdam</b> ellipse. Based on the work of <b>MacAdam,</b> the CIE 1960, CIE 1964, and CIE 1976 color spaces were developed, with the goal of achieving perceptual uniformity (have an equal distance in the color space correspond to equal differences in color). Although they were a distinct improvement over the CIE 1931 system, they were not completely free of distortion.|$|E
