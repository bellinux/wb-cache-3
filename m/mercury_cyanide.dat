There are also social impacts which include among others the violation {{of human rights in}} the decision-making process, immigration of job seekers into the community and workers' health problems and fatal accidents. Thirdly, cultural impacts are possible. These include the lost of or change in traditional livelihoods, the destruction of or damage to cultural heritage and the disturbance of sacred natural sites, mainly due to open pit mining. Former leader of CONACAMI, Miguel Palacín, explained this final impact in an interview in 2005 as: [...] "To open a pit in the highest mountain, the Apu, is like tearing a hole in the Cathedral of Lima to the Catholics" [...] Besides the described negative impacts, there are also potential positive aspects of mining, which include new job opportunities, improved infrastructure and services and different social, environmental or cultural heritage programs set up by the mining companies and/or regional authorities.

During these approaches, the interpretation of the data collected from the field necessarily causes the comparison of the analyses and measurements with reference values. Thus, the approach of MQA is based on the risk management policy conducted by the public authorities for the French population. It results in comparing the state of the investigated mediums with:• Natural environment close to the zone of investigation;• Regulatory management values set by the public authorities. Indeed, the public authorities fix sanitary values which regulate air quality as well as water and food. Therefore, these values naturally serve as references. However, the soil is not the object of a specific regulation and no regulatory reference value exists in France for this medium. A soil is considered free from pollution since its characteristics are coherent with the local natural geochemical background. This is why, the approach results in comparing the state of the investigated soil with the state of the natural soils close to the zone of investigation. With this intention, the knowledge of the natural geochemical background, in particular of the local geochemical anomalies, is essential. Moreover, the characterization of pollution is important to distinguish if it implies the site or not. However, the industrial sites are more often gathered in industrial and urban areas where an anthropic geochemical background is superimposed to the natural geochemical background. It then becomes necessary to compare data collected on the investigated site with this anthropized pedological and geochemical background.

In recent years, the area has been exposed to lead, cadmium, arsenic, <b>mercury</b> and <b>cyanide.</b> Both small and large-scale mining industries have reportedly contaminated rivers, streams, dug wells and boreholes with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, <b>mercury</b> and <b>cyanide.</b> There has been significant adverse impact upon health, economy, and social life that may be felt differently by women and men, raising the question of sustainable access to safe water as a millennium development goal (MDG) in the area. A multi-disciplinary approach was adopted in the project with distinct work components on the technical as well as on social, gender and policy aspects. It also aimed to suggest integrated strategies to address the problem so as to ensure achievement of the MDGs. Based upon a field study in 37 local communities coupled with water and sediment analysis from the area, the research indicated the existence of not only higher levels of metal contaminants in local water resources in Tarkwa area, particularlymanganese and iron, but also arsenic and aluminium in some wells. However, water resources, particularly groundwater is currently safe for human consumption but the spillages of cyanide and other effluents into surface streams have health and ecological implications. Levels of mercury in stream sediments are high with a clear risk of methylation of the mercury and transfer in the food chain via fish to humans. Regarding the impact of mining, it was found that for women who are the primary domestic water managers, contamination of local water sources has forced them to fetch water from greater distances, and livelihoods are hampered due to the fish loss through cyanide spillages in streams. Another finding was the lack of trust and rising water conflicts between mining authorities and the local communities. Regarding the policy aspects underlying the problem, it was found that {{there is a lack of}} coordination between the 3 policy areas, namely, rural water supply, mining, and environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental protection to the detriment of women as water users and domestic water managers. While impact of mining is increasingly seen as an issue of human rights violation, little is being done to strengthen participatory approaches especially involving women in rural water supply programs. The detailed analysis of the EIA regulations reveals that most mining have not undertaken any comprehensive EIA guiding their operations. A number of recommendations have emerged from the integrated perspective attempted to be developed through this research. These include a need for further in-depth explorations on the situation of contamination in groundwater and surface waters as well as stream sediments in the area; the need to resolve the situations of water conflicts between the local communities and the mining authorities by promoting greater public participation; and the need to minimize the gaps between the three related policy frameworks.

Commonly, accompanying this sediment are contaminants such as elemental <b>mercury</b> and <b>cyanide</b> used in the gold extraction process. We show that some of the mercury-contaminated sediment created by hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada, between 1852 and 1884, ended up over 250 kilometers (km) away in San Francisco Bay; an example of the far-reaching extent of contamination from such activities. A combination of radionuclide dating, bathymetric reconstruction, and geochemical tracers were used to distinguish the hydraulic mining sediment from sediment deposited in the bay before hydraulic mining started (pre-Gold Rush sediment) and sediment deposited after hydraulic mining stopped (modern sediment). Three San Francisco Bay cores were studied as well as source material from the abandoned hydraulic gold mines and river sediment between the mines and bay. Isotopic and geochemical compositions of the core sediments show a geochemical shift in sediment deposited during the time of hydraulic mining. The geochemical shift is characterized by a decrease in εNd, total organic carbon (TOC), Sr and Ca concentrations, Ca/Sr, and Ni/Zr; and, an increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, Al/Ca, Hg concentrations, and quartz/plagioclase. This shift is {{in the direction of the}} geochemical signature of sediments from rivers and gold mines in hydraulic mining areas. Mixing calculations using Nd isotopes and concentrations estimate that the hydraulic mining debris comprises up to 56 % of the sediment in core sediments deposited during the time of hydraulic mining. The surface sediment of cores taken in 1990 were found to contain up to 43 % hydraulic mining debris, reflecting a continuing remobilization and redistribution of the debris within the bay and transport from the watershed. Mercury concentrations in pre-Gold Rush sediment range between 0. 03 and 0. 08 μg g- 1. In core sediments that have characteristics of the gold deposits and were deposited during the time of hydraulic mining, mercury concentrations can be up to 0. 45 μg/g. Modern sediment (post- 1952 deposition) contains mercury concentrations up to 0. 79 μg/g and is likely a mix of hydraulic mining mercury and mercury introduced from other sources...|$|R

40|$|Recentemente, houve um aumento nas discussões em torno do gerenciamento de resíduos químicos em laboratórios de ensino e pesquisa no Brasil, tendo em vista que esses resíduos podem oferecer riscos ocupacionais, além de danos ao meio ambiente e à saúde pública. Diante disso, foi elaborado um plano de gerenciamento de resíduos para o Instituto de Química da Universidade Federal de Goiás (IQ/UFG), com horizonte de projeto de cinco anos. Foi realizado um levantamento de reagentes químicos, de materiais de escritório e de produtos de limpeza, entre outros, e verificadas quais eram as atividades geradoras de resíduos, identificando, quantificando e classificando todos esses produtos. Foram elaborados o diagnóstico e o prognóstico da segregação, da minimização, do acondicionamento, do armazenamento, da coleta, do transporte, do tratamento e da disposição final dos resíduos gerados. Os resultados indicaram que existe desperdício de materiais e que muitos reagentes encontram-se estocados de forma inadequada dentro dos laboratórios. A maioria dos resíduos não é tratada e não possui local apropriado para armazenamento. São gerados anualmente cerca de 900 kg de resíduos comuns e 600 kg de resíduos químicos, sendo as análises cromatográficas as atividades que mais geram esses resíduos químicos. A maioria deles é da classe I, com destaque para os inflamáveis. Os resíduos comuns são, na maior parte, papel e papelão. Foi proposta a construção de um abrigo para os resíduos químicos e a aquisição de outro contêiner para os resíduos comuns. Propôs-se a incineração dos materiais, com exceção daqueles contendo mercúrio e cianeto, os quais devem ser encaminhados para um aterro de resíduos perigosos. Conclui-se que os resíduos comuns recicláveis devem ser encaminhados para cooperativas de reciclagem e os não-recicláveis para o aterro sanitário de Goiânia. The {{quantity}} of waste generated grows {{and can cause}} many problems to {{human health and the}} environment. Recently, increased the discussions around the management of chemical waste in laboratories for teaching and research in Brazil, with that, details emerged of how this waste could provide occupational risks, besides offering damage to the environment. Hence, the plan for managing waste to the Institute of Chemistry of the Federal University of Goiás (IQ/UFG) was idealized. At work diagnoses and predictions for each stage of waste management were executed simultaneously, in a horizon of five years of the project. We raised the chemicals and materials used and the waste-generating activities, and then identified, quantified and ranked all waste generated. The diagnosis and prognosis of segregation, minimization, packaging, storage, collection, transportation, treatment and final disposal of waste generated were prepared. The results indicated that some materials were purchased in excess and many reagents are inadequately stored in the laboratories. The management at IQ/UFG is worrying, because there is no treatment and appropriate place for the storage of waste. 900 kg of common waste and 600 kg of chemical waste are generated per year. The chromatographic analyses are the activities that generate more chemical waste and administrative work is the activity that generates more common waste. Most of the chemical waste is of class I and flammable waste represents the greater percentage. Most of the common waste is paper and cardboard. It was proposed to build a shelter for the chemical waste and the acquisition of other containers for common waste. The chemical waste will be incinerated but waste containing <b>mercury</b> and <b>cyanide,</b> which will be forwarded to a hazardous waste landfill. The common recyclable waste will be transported to recycling cooperatives and non-recyclable waste will be sent to the landfill...|$|R

In general, sulphide minerals are rare (< 3 %). Fifteen rock samples were collected in Wamsaid area for geochemical assaying for Au, Ag, As, Sb, Hg, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Eleven of fifteen samples yielded more than 1. 00 g/t Au, in which six of them are in excess of 3. 00 g/t Au. It can be noted that all high-grade samples are originally or containing limonitic materials, that suggest the role of supergene enrichment. Interestingly, most of the high-grade samples contain also high grade As (up to 991 ppm), Sb (up to 885 ppm), and Hg (up to 75 ppm). Fluid inclusions in both quartz vein types consist of four phases including L-rich, V-rich, L-V-rich, and L 1 -L 2 -V (CO 2) -rich phases. Mineralizing hydrothermal fluid is typified by CO 2 -rich fluid, moderate temperature of 300 - 400 ºC and a typical low salinity (0. 36 to 0. 54 wt. % NaCl eq). Based on those key features, gold mineraliza­tion in Buru Island meets the characteristics of LS epithermal or orogenic gold deposit types; however, it tends to be fitter with orogenic gold deposit rather than another type.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis(MTech (Chem. Eng. Technology)) [...] //Cape Technikon, 1999 The gold mining {{industry}} has mainly relied upon {{the use of}} a highly polluting chemicals, such as <b>mercury</b> and <b>cyanide,</b> to recover gold from its ores. As environmental legislation has become more stringent in all countries and environmental protection has become the focus of world-wide research, development of environmental sound processes has been favoured. The Coal Gold Agglomeration (CGA) process is such a process which was developed some years ago and has the advantage in that gold is recovered by a procedure which has little or no effect on the environment. The CGA process is based on the hydrophobic characteristics of coal, gold and oil. Gold particles which are substantially free become attached to the coal-oil agglomerates during collision, and eventually penetrate into the agglomerates. The resulting agglomerates are recycled to increase the gold loading, separated from the slurry, burnt, ashed and smelted to produce gold bullion. Laboratory scale batch tests were performed on an artificial/synthetic gold ore, containing fine gold powder. The slurry was contacted with a mixture of coal and oil. i. e. coal-oil agglomerates, after which both the agglomerates and ore were analysed for gold. Operating parameters, such as the mode of contact between the coal-oil phase and the gold containing slurry, contact time of the slurry and the coal-oil phase, means of separating the coal-oil gold agglomerates from the slurry, coal to ore, coal to oil and water to ore ratios, type of oil, effect of collectors and the mineralogy of the ore on the gold recovery were investigated. Results have shown that stirring the coal-oil phase and the slug yielded higher gold loadings than shaking and the traditional rolling bottle technique. BI increasing the time of contact between the coal-oil phase and the gold slurry. the final gold loading in the agglomerates increases, until an equilibrium value is reached. An increase in the amount of coal, together with a decrease in the amount of water used in the slurry, has shown to increase gold recoveries. Furthermore, by varying the concentration and volume of a collector. such as potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) enhanced the settling rate and enabled the effectiveness of separation. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} gold loading on the coal-oil phase increased after recycling it. Further tests were performed on a real ore sample and after X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, it was found that certain minerals other than gold was transferred to the coal-oil phase. The theoretical foundation of the CGA process is based on the difference in free energy and was expressed as a function of the interfacial tensions and three-phase contact angles between gold, oil and water, together with the ratio of coal-oil agglomerate to gold particle radii, as the free energy is a measure of the thermodynamic stability and hence, partly a measure of gold recoveries, meaningful predictions as to gold recoveries were made by performing a sensitivity analysis on the variables connected to the free energy, It was, however, found that some operating parameters, which were linked to other factors, such as the maximum gold transfer into coal-oil phase and the separation efficiency of the agglomerates. were vital to be taken into account when predictions as to gold recoveries were made. Therefore, the gold recoveries were found to be a function of the thermodynamic stability as well as the maximum gold transfer into the coal-oil phase and the separation efficiency of the agglomerates, The meaningful information gained by performing the theoretical investigations were applied and linked to gold recoveries, thereby providing useful explanations as to the typical gold recoveries obtained during experimentation. A comparative study on mercury amalgamation was done to evaluate the performance of the CGA process. It was found that the CGA process yielded better gold recoveries than amalgamation, which makes it the better process both in terms of recoveries as well as environmental safety, A further application of the theoretical knowledge was, however, very useful to explain the tendency of the CGA process yielding the better results...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, keeping {{mining and}} the {{environment}} sustainable {{is a major concern}} all over the world. Using toxic chemicals such as <b>cyanide</b> and <b>mercury</b> in the gold leaching process {{is one of the main}} factors that need to be considered in terms of the environment. Finding alternative lixiviants is one solution that would decrease the uses of these toxic chemicals. Thiosulfate is one of the most promising alternative substitutes to cyanide kinetically and environmentally. Gold leaching in thiosulfate solutions was evaluated environmentally and kinetically in different ways: (1) applying a closed system to leach gold (2) evaluating the environmental and metallurgical optimum thiosulfate leaching characteristics for pure gold and pure silver and gold silver alloys (4, 8, 20 and 50 wt % silver), (3) studying the electrochemical behavior of gold, silver, and gold/silver alloys (4) optimizing the leaching conditions of gold ore samples supplied from Centamin Egypt Limited Company, (5) finally, studying the ability of thiosulfate solutions to dissolve mercury and evaluating gold, copper, and mercury recovery from ion-exchange resins. The study showed that the leaching rate of gold and silver in the closed vessel was greater than that obtained in the open vessel by 30 % and 45 % respectively. To avoid the losses of ammonia a closed leaching system is recommended. Gold and silver leaching in thiosulfate solution is preferable kinetically and environmentally if conducted in a closed vessel system. The effect silver alloyed with gold was evaluated and the result showed that the dissolution rate of pure gold is higher than that form 4 and 8 wt% Ag alloys. And the dissolution rate of gold from 20 and 50 % silver alloys is more than that obtained for pure gold. The silver dissolution rate is sensitive to copper(II) concentration being 1. 67 x 10 - 5 mol. m- 2. s- 1 at an initial copper(II) concentration of 1. 25 mM and 6. 6 x 10 - 5 mol. m- 2. s- 1 at an initial copper(II) concentration of 10 mM. Silver dissolution is more sensitive to ammonia than gold. From the electrochemical study on gold/silver alloys, it was found that an increase in silver in the alloy results in an increase of the current density from both gold and silver oxidation in thiosulfate solutions in the range of potentials 0. 242 - 0. 542 V. Also, it was found that in thiosulfate solutions containing thiourea, the oxidation current of gold/silver alloys decreased and the oxidation current from pure gold after the standard potential for gold oxidation (150 mV) is higher than the total oxidation current from gold-silver alloys. Leaching of a selected gold ore using thiosulfate solutions for 24 hours suggested the optimum conditions to leach the ore to be 0. 2 – 0. 4 M thiosulfate, 400 mM NH 3, 10 - 20 mM Cu(II), 30 ºC, 300 rpm, no air supplied, solid/liquid ratio 20 %, and mean particle size of < - 106 μm. Finally, the study showed that mercury dissolves in thiosulfate solutions as it dissolves in <b>cyanide.</b> <b>Mercury</b> dissolves in thiosulfate solutions in the order: HgS 2 <Hg 0 <Hg 2 Cl 2 <HgCl 2. The effect of mercury on gold and copper loading and recovery from resins was evaluated and the results showed that mercury does not influence gold and copper loading and recovery. Also, it was found that mercury elution from the loaded resin is slower than the recovery of gold and copper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Olifants River Water Resource Development Project (ORWRDP) is a {{multipurpose}} project incorporating {{both economic}} and social development objectives to cater for the water demands of commercial and social users. Phase 2 of the project encompassed the construction of the De Hoop Dam within the Steelpoort River basin and bulk water transfer pipelines. During this study, various water quality assessment techniques were conducted {{along the length of the}} Steelpoort River from a site situated just downstream of the De Hoop Dam to a site near the town of Steelpoort in order to determine spatial trends and relate these trends to changes imposed by the construction of the De Hoop Dam and the bulk water transfer pipeline. A total of four sites were selected within the Steelpoort River to assess the impacts on water quality as a result of the construction activities. Chemical water analyses and Physico-chemical Assessment Index (PAI) techniques were employed to assess the water quality status and to determine the present ecological state of the Steelpoort River. The water quality results with respect to the different water constituents did not illustrate a distinct change in water quality over the study period. From the results obtained during this study, it was detected that concentrations of nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate and nitrite were generally low and similar to the concentrations recorded prior to construction in the baseline study for the ORWRDP. Mats of filamentous algae were observed to increase with distance increase downstream of the dam and they may be responsible for the uptake and removal of nutrients within the river. The highest concentrations of nitrate were recorded at Site 3 (Dwars River), a tributary of the Steelpoort River. Agricultural return flows and pollution such as dumping of used nappies were identified as the main sources of nutrient inputs within the Steelpoort River. The concentration of toxic constituents such as lead, cadmium, <b>cyanide,</b> <b>mercury,</b> manganese, zinc and arsenic were recorded below detection limit at all sites with occasional spikes observed. The most noticeable impact observed during this study occurred due to the alteration in the flow regime as a consequence of construction activities. Alteration of flow has resulted in the erosion of stream banks along the Steelpoort River. Pipeline construction activities have resulted in the removal of riparian vegetation, stream diversions which encourage erosion and were observed to contribute significantly to the sediment loads entering the river through water discharges. This may have resulted in high turbidity levels and siltation observed downstream at Site 4. The eco-classification scores using PAI indicated that the Steelpoort River is a moderately impaired watercourse in terms of water quality. The main driver components contributing to such a score were excessive sedimentation and changes in trophic status with distance downstream. Site 3 (Dwars River) a tributary to the Steelpoort River was still largely natural. The findings of this study indicated that the Steelpoort River is in the similar ecological class in terms of water quality as prior to construction of the De Hoop Dam and the bulk water transfer pipeline. The water quality within the Steelpoort River however deteriorated during construction mainly due to the addition of sediment loads. It was therefore recommended that further studies be carried out within the Steelpoort River on macro-invertebrate response and the habitat integrity to increase the level of confidence of results obtained in this study.
