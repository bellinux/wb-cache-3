They flee to a theater, where Valiant {{explains to}} Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a crime in Toontown. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of <b>Maroon</b> Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront <b>Maroon,</b> leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. <b>Maroon</b> tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company {{so that he could}} then sell the studio, but is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene and, assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and <b>Maroon</b> and that the former had given her his will for safe-keeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are soon captured by Doom and the weasels.|$|E

40|$|Based on ethnography, {{oral history}} and archival research, this study {{examines}} {{the culture of the}} Accompong <b>Maroons</b> by focusing on the political, economic, social, religious and kinship institutions, foodways, and land history. This research demonstrates that like the South American <b>Maroons,</b> the Accompong <b>Maroons</b> differ in their ideology and symbolisms from the larger New World population. However, the Accompong <b>Maroons</b> have assimilated, accommodated and integrated into the state in every other aspect. As a consequence, the Accompong <b>Maroons</b> can only be considered <b>maroons</b> in name only. Today's Accompong <b>Maroons</b> resemble any other rural peasant community in Jamaica. Grounded in historical analysis, the study also demonstrate that social stratification in Accompong Town results from unequal access to land and other resources, lack of economic infrastructure, and constraints on food marketeers and migration. This finding does not support the concept of communalism presented in previous studies...|$|R
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad <b>maroon</b> centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner <b>maroon</b> line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the <b>Maroon</b> Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the <b>Maroon</b> Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E

5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to <b>maroon.</b> <b>Maroon</b> was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E

No. 46245 was the first, in December 1957; a further fifteen examples followed between May and November 1958. The style of lining varied: the first six repaints into <b>maroon</b> (including No. 46245) were lined out in the LMS style; the last ten received the BR style of lining as used on the standard green livery; No. 46247, originally lined in the LMS style, was given the BR style in July 1959; and by November 1961 those with the BR lining were repainted to match No. 46245.|$|E
