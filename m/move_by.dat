5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial <b>move</b> <b>by</b> hiring an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write}} a weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E

500|$|Robert Kilwardby (c. 1215–1279) {{discussed}} three alternative {{explanations of}} the motions of the celestial spheres, rejecting the views that celestial bodies are animated and are <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> their own spirits or souls, or that the celestial bodies are <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> angelic spirits, which govern and move them. [...] He maintained, instead, that [...] "celestial bodies are <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> their own natural inclinations similar to weight". [...] Just as heavy bodies are naturally <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> their own weight, which is an intrinsic active principle, so the celestial bodies are naturally <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> a similar intrinsic principle. [...] Since the heavens are spherical, the only motion that could be natural to them is rotation.

30|$|If the {{evidence}} regarding tsunamis in folklore or historical documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region were <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that the boulders were <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have been <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the tsunamis, but instead could have been <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> storm waves. This suggests that the boulders <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> tsunamis would be relocated by storm waves, if the runup heights of the tsunamis were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of the computed tsunamis.|$|R

50|$|Usual Parliamentary {{convention}}, codified by the Speaker's Conference in 1973, is {{that such}} a motion is <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the Chief Whip of the party to which the former MP belonged. However, this convention is not always followed, and such a motion can be <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> an MP of another party. This can arise because the former MP {{did not belong to}} a party: the writ for the by-election arising from the death of Independent Republican Frank Maguire was <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> Jim Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; and after Bobby Sands died on hunger strike the writ for a second by-election was <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> Dafydd Elis-Thomas of Plaid Cymru.

In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September. All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising <b>move</b> <b>by</b> the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the success}} of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two {{supporting}} operations codenamed Aberlour and Ottawa.

Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in manpower and materiel. The initial opposition was expected to come from the depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E

5|$|Eugène's {{artillery}} {{continued to}} pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout {{set up a}} crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over {{to the right to}} support Miloradovich in his defense of the redoubt. The French responded to this <b>move</b> <b>by</b> sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard artillery. Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg's IV Cavalry Corps, as well as of Viceroy Eugène's own artillery, opening up a massive artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the <b>move</b> <b>by</b> making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick). This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their historic sports rivalry—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans know it as the chilenita, while Peruvians call it the chalaca. Regardless, the move is also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E
5|$|Following MacArthur's {{directive}} {{to secure}} the airfields at Lae and Finschhafen, the Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces, South West Pacific Area, General Thomas Blamey, an Australian, ordered the capture of the Huon Peninsula. The 9th Division under Major General George Wootten was tasked with the job. The initial focus was upon securing Lae. The Allies formulated a plan to achieve this that would see the 9th Division conduct an amphibious landing east of Lae, while the 7th Division would <b>move</b> <b>by</b> air to Nadzab in the Markham Valley, which had been secured by parachute troops from the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment and the 2/4th Field Regiment. From Nadzab, the 7th Division would advance on Lae from the south to support the 9th Division's drive towards Lae. At the same time, the Australian 3rd Division and the US 162nd Infantry Regiment would fight a diversionary action around Salamaua.|$|E

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious <b>move</b> <b>by</b> Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The <b>move</b> <b>by</b> the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.|$|E
