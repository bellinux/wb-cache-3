40|$|Abstract. A {{finite element}} model is {{proposed}} to determine the residual strength {{and the evolution of}} damage area of indented sandwiches structures with Nomex honeycomb core and <b>metallic</b> <b>skins</b> indented by a spherical indenter under longitudinal compression load (CAI).

Introduction. The model used to simulate the behavior of indented sandwich structure under CAI loading is taken from a complete study from [1] and [2]. Those studies proposed to represent the honeycomb by a grid of non-linear spring which its behavior law is obtained from a uniform transverse compression on a block of Nomex Honeycomb alone.

30|$|In conclusion, no {{statistically}} significant difference was detected in our primary endpoint of wound infection when comparing superficial wound closure with metallic staples versus running subcuticular monocryl suture and sealed with OCA in acetabular fracture surgery.

In addition, negative pressure dressings can be used to safely and effectively treat a non-infected draining surgical wound. Closure with OCA and subcuticular monocryl showed no clinical disadvantages and appears to have a clinical advantage when compared to standard <b>metallic</b> staple <b>skin</b> closure in acetabular fracture surgery.

40|$|The {{experience}} of construction of composite primary aircraft structures has approved that the weight decrease for composite aggregates of aircraft {{in comparison with}} metallic analogues cannot be obtained within the frames of conventional structures based on stiffened laminated composite skin. One {{of the main reasons}} is the low level of stress-strain characteris- tics of current polymer resins, which does not allow to realize high strength characteristics of carbon fibers in laminated composite packages. This consequence does not allow to use stiffened composite skin as a universal structure element, un- like <b>metallic</b> stiffened <b>skin</b> that sustains all main mechanical loads, including impact, loads from pressurizing and also sus- tains environmental factors. Hence, creation of lightweight and reliable composite primary structure elements of airframe, the novel types of structure layouts, allowing to realize high potential of current composite materials to the maximal extent, should be developed. In order to provide the development of such layots the novel approach is required, as the conventional stage-by-stage approach is based on a number of sufficient assumptions, most of which are correct only for the structures made of metallic alloys, but not correct as applied to the structures made of composite materials. The impossibility of the application of a stage-by-stage approach together with a significant increase of number of design parameters (in comparison with metallic structures), leads to the radical increase of labor input of the design task of composite structures. The novel approach to design of composite airframes, allowing to significantly decrease the extremely high labor input of the design process for composite structures is presented in this study. The approach presumes simultaneous solu- tions of design tasks on different levels of detailing of composite aircraft structure within the frames of the one integral design stage. The application of the novel approach allowed to obtain a number of lightweight solutions for the structure of cylindrical fuselage section of civil aircraft and for the hermetic cabin of the "Flying wing" aircraft...|$|R

40|$|The term "mass-customization" in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) {{industry}} {{refers to}} architectural elements that have similar purpose but are {{completely different from}} each other. Architects use mass-customized elements to give diverse design to different parts of a building. Mass-customization derives from three developments in computational technology: Building Information Modeling (BIM), the implications of programing in graphical representation, and the progress of computer-controlled manufacturing machines. However, the promise held by these technologies has not been fulfilled. While mass-customization is implemented in projects with large budgets, they are rarely employed in mainstream real estate. This thesis examines two multi-family projects: The Project on 8 Spruce Street and the Porter House, both located in Manhattan, to outline the challenges of executing commercial real estate projects that employ mass-customized envelope systems and makes suggestions {{as to how to}} overcome them. The thesis then examines the aircraft manufacturing industry, which is proficient in the use of Building Information Modeling and has advanced logistical expertise in transporting large-scale elements. The thesis examines its use of design and assembly processes such as Concurrent Engineering and Lean Manufacturing, and suggests that these techniques can be incorporated into the project delivery methods of the AEC industry. The thesis focuses on the production of fuselage and <b>metallic</b> wing <b>skin</b> panels, distinguishing between fabrication technologies that are used for the manufacturing of single-curved and double-curved panels. The thesis proposes ways in which these processes can be adapted to the standards of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, and suggests that such adaptation could reduce fabrication costs. The thesis concludes by outlining the incentives for the aircraft industry to transition part of its operation into the fabrication of mass-customized envelopes for commercial real estate, pointing to the potential markets for such systems in the growing economies of China, Latin America and India.

40|$|Components made of fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} make {{an important}} contribution to reducing vehicle weight in the automotive industry. Recent developments show an increasing industrial interest in integrating fiber-reinforced plastics in existing metal structures. One challenge is the appropriate joining of these hybrid structures. It is important to avoid interrupting or damaging of the fiber flows, to take the forces in the joining area as homogeneous as possible, to ensure sufficient skin quality and to meet corrosion-technical requirements - especially when joining carbon fiber reinforced plastics with metals. This research project examined the joining of an CFRP structural component with a <b>metallic</b> outer <b>skin</b> part by hem flange bonding. Such hybrid FRP-metal assembly combines the outstanding properties of both materials in the composite, while the hem flange bonding ensures optimum connectivity. The embedding of the joining process in the existing process chains and the use of existing plant technology for the production of automobile hang on parts among OEMs and suppliers promise a rapid implementation of the results. The advantages mentioned are facing new challenges resulting from both the manufacturing process chain {{as well as from the}} operating conditions and material-specific properties. Within the project the following issues were examined: Joining process: According to the specified materials and process boundary conditions, suitable adhesives were chosen. These have been studied and characterized both in situ and in the hem flange. The hem flange bonding of steel-CFRP and aluminum-CFRP assemblies was studied in different model geometries using tabletop hemming and roller hemming. Here, the hemming result was evaluated and the CFRP inner part was examined for possible damage. The results show that the forces during the hemming process do not lead to any structural damage in the CFRP. Thermal stress: If the hem flange bonding of the hybrid assembly is implemented in the common process chain, there are heatings up to 200 ° C in the subsequent coating process. This results in the so-called delta-apha-problem because the coefficient of thermal expansion of the outer metal part is significantly higher than the FRP inner part, resulting in relative movements during heating and cooling of the assembly. The expansion of the parts, the relative movements in the composite and the warpage occurring after the adhesive curing were recorded and evaluated. In addition, the description of the processes in the furnace as well as forecasts of war page were carried out by numerical simulation. Then constructive measures were examined in order to reduce the warpage of hem flange bonded hybrid assemblies. Joint properties: The strength of the bonded CFRP-metal hem flanges was determined and evaluated in peel tests and 3 -point bending tests. In 3 -point bending test it was proved that the hem flange not fails even for large sample deformation. The corrosion of metal-CFRP hybrid assemblies is essentially affected by disbonding of adhesive at metal surface and defects or critical areas in the hem flange. Good corrosion protection performance could be achieved by optimization of hemming parameters and selection of suitable adhesives...|$|R
