50|$|The Surfers Paradise <b>Meter</b> <b>Maids</b> were {{introduced}} to the world in 1965 by local businessman Bernie Elsey to provide a positive spin on parking regulations.

50|$|The Surfers Paradise <b>Meter</b> <b>Maids</b> were {{introduced}} in 1965 when entrepreneur Bernie Elsey opposed the installation of parking meters in Surfers Paradise. The maids were hired to top up expired parking meters and dressed in gold bikinis. Meter feeding {{is against the law}} but council decided to ignore the offence due to the good publicity it garnered. Gold Coast Mayor Bruce Small promoted the city in 1967 through the use of the bikini-clad <b>meters</b> <b>maids.</b> The evolution of parking meters has rendered the <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> initial goal useless and are seen as a novelty these days.|$|R

[...] She was strangled {{to death by}} a jealous roommate in 1982 with leg warmers, which Roxy had invented.

2500|$|In {{the initial}} concept, Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe, and Kelly Garrett have {{graduated}} from the police academy in Los Angeles, California. Despite proving their capability during training, all three have subsequently been assigned to be a <b>meter</b> <b>maid,</b> office worker, and crossing guard, respectively. Dissatisfied with these jobs, they are recruited {{to work for the}} 'Charles Townsend Agency' as private investigators. All of this is explained in the opening credit sequence; neither the pilot film nor subsequent series ever actually depicted an [...] "origin story" [...] as they are seen to have been working as investigators for some time as of the start of the pilot.|$|E
50|$|In Surfers Paradise, Queensland, gold lamé bikini-clad <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> stroll up {{and down}} the beach feeding coins into parking meters so that beach-goers won't get parking tickets.

5000|$|The Surfers Paradise <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> {{were first}} instituted by {{entrepreneur}} Bernie Elsey in 1965, through the Surfers Paradise Progress Association, which {{was opposed to}} the introduction of parking meters by the Gold Coast City Council. The <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> carried a gold bag of sixpences to top-up expired meters, thereby saving motorists from a £1 fine. [...] The women left a card stating: [...] "You have just been saved from a parking fine by the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids".|$|R
50|$|Because {{the field}} {{developed}} {{in such an}} unusual way, essentially to accommodate changes and professionalization of policing, municipal employees of this class began taking on tasks historically performed by police officers, but without any policing powers or protections under the law. <b>Meter</b> <b>Maids</b> initially serviced parking meters, which had been a fairly new phenomenon in North American cities of the 1950s. Eventually, as traffic police officers only rarely enforced parking meter regulation, the cities required <b>Meter</b> <b>Maids</b> to write parking tickets. By the 1970s, most large municipalities had <b>Meter</b> <b>Maids,</b> who, {{through the course of}} the 1980s & the 90's, transformed into Parking Enforcement Officers and were asked to enforce many more regulations than just those pertaining to meters. In recent history, Parking Enforcement Officers are increasingly taking on other duties, and municipalities (for the reasons mentioned above) are amalgamating specialized enforcement into general duty bylaw enforcement.|$|R

He lived a life of privilege and would amuse himself by injuring immigrant laborers. Mr. Burns later attended Yale University, where he studied both science and business, joined Skull and Bones, and competed in the [...] "etherweight" [...] wrestling class, later graduating in the class of 1914. At his 25-year college reunion, he became romantically involved with the daughter of an old flame. She would later bear his child, Larry Burns, who was given up for adoption and would later enter Mr. Burns' life briefly.

50|$|The {{activities}} of the <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> were supposed to promote goodwill, but they were controversial because feeding parking meters was illegal. However the council decided to ignore the offence because the maids were providing such good publicity for the area. The first maid, Annette Welch, was disinherited by her grandmother for working in that way, but went on to marry {{the manager of a}} real estate firm in Surfers Paradise.

50|$|During the Great Depression, city {{revenues}} dwindled. With parking meters, however, a {{new source}} of municipal revenue was found. Not only did the nickels paid in by parkers accumulate, but so did the fines imposed for over parking. By 1944, American cities were generating some $10 million annually from parking meters alone. Soon after came <b>meter</b> <b>maids,</b> who, because they were paid less than police officers, increased city revenues further. Complex parking rules, restrictions and regulations are now an integral part of modern life and landscape.|$|R

5000|$|There {{has been}} {{persistent}} {{criticism that the}} scantily-clad <b>meter</b> <b>maids</b> are an anachronism and an embarrassment.

In 2010, Gold Coast Tourism revealed plans to have the maids travel around Australia to promote the Gold Coast, but in much less revealing outfits. Roberta Aitchison was quoted as querying the idea, saying that the maids' distinctive swimsuits were integral to their image. There has been efforts to introduce male equivalent meter boys.|$|R
