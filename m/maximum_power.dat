5|$|In 1922, Alfred J.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluate}} {{the relationship among}} post-voiding residual urine volume, bladder outlet obstruction and <b>maximum</b> detrusor contractility <b>power.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated urodynamically and retrospectively 242 elderly men with various grades of bladder outlet obstruction and symptoms. RESULTS: Residual urine predominantly correlated with bladder outlet obstruction and not with <b>maximum</b> detrusor contractility <b>power.</b> <b>Maximum</b> detrusor contractility <b>power</b> showed significant positive correlation with bladder outlet obstruction. Urodynamically, the detrusor compensates for bladder outlet obstruction with elevated <b>maximum</b> detrusor contractility <b>power.</b> Decay of contraction during micturition however, hampers effective emptying. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Maximum</b> detrusor contractility <b>power</b> limits for normal detrusor contractility must be related to bladder outlet obstruction grade.

5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E

High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices.

5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E

Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> to the right engine.

5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain <b>maximum</b> <b>power.</b> Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Heidfeld paced the session, almost one-tenth of a second faster than Bird in second, who in turn, was a further three-tenths of a second in front of third-placed Buemi who went wide at the first corner on his first timed lap despite being in clean air. Evans and di Grassi (who made a mistake in turn 17) were the group's slowest two drivers. Turvey was the fastest driver in the second group and set the quickest overall group stage time of any {{participant}} at one minute and 2.712 seconds which was 0.053 seconds faster than Abt. López, Félix da Costa and Sarrazin rounded out the top five. In the third group, after the previous four drivers went onto the track, Duval was on his <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> lap when he spun heading towards the first corner and made contact with the barriers lining the circuit, causing the session to be stopped to allow his car to be extracted from the track. After the session restarted with three minutes remaining, Vergne was the third group's fastest driver, followed by Prost who lost half a second in the track's second sector, with Frijns, Piquet and Duval filling the next three positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went wide on his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full power capacity and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, but then his rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost him time. Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his rear tyres and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at <b>maximum</b> <b>power),</b> the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
