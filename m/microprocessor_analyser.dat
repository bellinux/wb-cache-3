40|$|Aim: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} dental fluorosis in relation with different fluoride levels in drinking water among school going children of 6 - 12 years age group. Materials and Methods: Dental fluorosis was recorded using Deanâ€²s index in school children of selected villages. The drinking water samples of all the selected villages were collected in polyethylene bottles and the fluoride content of these samples was determined by fluoride ion selective method using Orion <b>microprocessor</b> <b>analyser.</b> Results: The overall prevalence of dental fluorosis {{was found to be}} 69. 84 %. An increase in the community fluorosis index (CFI) with corresponding increase in water fluoride content was found. Conclusion: There was an increase in prevalence of dental fluorosis with a corresponding increase in water fluoride content from 0. 8 ppm to 4. 1 ppm. A significantly strong positive correlation was found between CFI and fluoride concentration in drinking water...|$|E
40|$|Fluoride dentifrices {{are well}} {{accepted}} for their caries preventive effects. The fluoride {{concentration in the}} oral fluids after tooth brushing with fluoride dentifrices may have an important relationship to the caries reducing capacity. The present study was aimed to clinically evaluate the salivary fluoride retention of dentifrices containing low fluoride concentration in 50 children, aged 7 - 9 years before, {{during and after the}} use of fluoride toothpaste. Estimation of fluoride in saliva was done using a Orion <b>microprocessor</b> ion <b>analyser</b> with a fluoride specific ion electrode. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that there is considerable salivary fluoride retention after brushing with fluoride dentifrices. The retention of fluoride in the saliva at a higher level even with the low fluoride concentration, proves the similar cariostatic effect as of higher concentration...|$|R
