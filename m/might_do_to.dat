5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy Stead as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{concluded}} {{by stating}} that a programme of rapid land acquisition {{would be impossible to}} support, citing concern about the damage which this <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> Zimbabwe's agricultural output and its prospects of attracting investment.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1915 and 1916, Michelena {{wrote the}} regular {{newspaper}} column [...] "Talks with Screen-struck Girls", carried at {{first by the}} San Rafael Independent on Tuesdays but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers: San Francisco Examiner and the Prescott Journal-Miner (Arizona). She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E

It said: [...] "I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms—he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> you or your loved ones..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yellow Robe taught tens of {{thousands}} of school children and several generations of New Yorkers about Native American history and culture. She primarily told stories and folklore of the Lakota and local Eastern Woodlands tribes. Rosebud recalled, [...] "When I first lectured to public school classes in New York, many of the smaller children hid under their desks, for they knew from the movies what a blood-thirsty scalping Indian <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, Rey faced one of {{the worst}} {{challenges}} of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape. The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like [...] "borrowing" [...] money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name. Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, [...] "My Fans Are in Trouble" [...] to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor. What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business {{at the peak of his}} career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.|$|E
2500|$|The elder sannyasi Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami was {{a disciple}} of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's sannyasa guru and was long a well-wisher of ISKCON. A {{small group of}} {{prominent}} ISKCON leaders were closer to his association and Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana {{made no effort to}} conceal his relationship with them, which as time went on became increasingly intimate. His emphasis on gopi-bhava, the mood of Krishna's cowherd lovers, particularly disturbed his ISKCON audiences since Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami had stressed that the path of spontaneous devotion was only for liberated souls. At the annual GBC meeting in 1993, members questioned their affiliation with Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami. Those involved minimized the seriousness of the relationship, though for some it {{had been going on for}} as long as five years. By the next annual meeting, the GBC forced the involved members to promise to greatly restrict further association with their new teacher. Though adhering externally, their sympathies for Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana's teachings were unabated. [...] In 1995 GBC position was firm and the controversy was first on the 1995 annual meeting's agenda. A week of thorough investigation brought the implicated members in line. Asked to suggest what they <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make amends, the leaders involved with the controversy tendered their resignations, which the GBC promptly refused. They further volunteered to refrain from initiating new disciples or visiting Vrindavana until their case could be reassessed the following year and at the March 1996 meeting GBC insisted on maintaining most of the restrictions.|$|E

40|$|A near tripling in {{the price}} of crude oil from March 1999 to the first months of 2000, coupled with other developments, {{initially}} brought about sharp increases {{in the price}} of home heating oil and diesel fuel, which are essentially the same product. Gasoline prices then increased. These developments brought about discussion of what <b>might</b> be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> mitigate price increases and possible spot shortages, and what <b>might</b> be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent a similar situation in the future...|$|R

You see, she was afraid of what Old Jed Thumper <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> Peter, and--well, the truth is she was afraid of what he <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> her if he should find out that she had made friends with Peter.|$|E
