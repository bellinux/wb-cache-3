40|$|Abstract:- Zero-order <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> (ZOH) {{are mainly}} used in digital control {{applications}} {{to obtain the}} output analog signals of digitally implemented controllers. However, it is proved that special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> such as the fractional order <b>hold</b> <b>device</b> (FROH) can improve, if properly tuned, the performance of hybrid control systems. Although the applicability of these devices has been theoretically studied in numerous works, there is no report of real experimentation with digital controllers that include special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> for the control signal interpolation. This lack of real application experiments is mainly due to the difficulties encountered in implementing such <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> with the processing speed and configurability that real-time digital controllers require. This paper describes a totally configurable digital design of a FROH device, adequate for any digital control system platform. The implementation of an 8 -bit resolution FROH prototype {{has been carried out}} and its performance tested on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) ...|$|R
