40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> {{of civil}} society organizations (CSOs) through quantitative content analysis of four dailies (HN, LN, MFD and Právo). The aim is to analyze and describe CSOs <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> in relation to media elements that characterize these representations, {{as well as through}} space and priority, organizations and actors that are associated with. The selected method allows the comparison of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> for particular newspapers. The study builds on a social-constructivist paradigm, focusing on the agenda-setting theory, gatekeeping and news values. Thesis also discusses specifics of the CSOs and non-profit logic in relation to media and journalistic logic and their influence on the final CSOs <b>media</b> <b>representations,</b> including potential nonprofit dilemmas. The <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> are strongly determined by regionality and relationship with other sectors. CSOs are presented through positive and uncontroversial theme of good deeds. Regionality is together with social themes the most frequent topics associated with CSOs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the impact gendered <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of {{entrepreneurs}} may have on the reality of female entrepreneurship. It analyses the representation of women entrepreneurs in a women's magazine. <b>Media</b> <b>representations</b> influence, firstly, whether women perceive entrepreneurship as desirable and attainable, and thus impact the strength and direction of their entrepreneurial aspirations. Secondly, <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> shape how key stakeholders such as bankers or clients view and interact with female business owners, thereby impacting women entrepreneurs’ business relations and opportunities. The paper reviews research on <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of women entrepreneurs, gender inequalities in entrepreneurial activity and work before presenting an in-depth qualitative analysis of a magazine series reporting on female entrepreneurs. The authors’ analysis reveals how the woman's magazine in question portrays female entrepreneurship as focused on traditionally female activities and pursuits and as domestically-centred. Relating these findings to evidence on gender inequalities in entrepreneurial activity, the paper raises important questions about the impact of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of women entrepreneurs. The paper demonstrates the benefits of understanding entrepreneurial activity as work and includes analytical perspectives from the sociology of work in the analysis of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of entrepreneurship...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to compare the <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of resettlement of syrian refugees, {{as one of the}} possible solutions to the migration crisis. According to the social constructivism theory, media are understood {{to be one of the}} most important factors in the process of constructing reality, and when it comes to political topics, their role is even more significant, as most of the time, <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of political issues is the only option to acquire information about them. The so called migration crisis with its proposed solutions is one of the most common agendas set by mass media, the most discussed solution being resettlement. Thought resettlement is globally ​applicable​, its history and extension differs throughout the world, so its <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> is expected to be different. This study, realized through quantitative content analysis, was focused on the comparison of <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of resettlement of Syrian refugees in the U. S. and in the Czech Republic, the analyzed media being Mladá Fronta Dnes and Hospodářské noviny for the Czech republic, and The New York Times for The United States.

40|$|This {{book is a}} clear, systematic, {{original}} and lively account of how <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> shape {{the way we see}} our and others’ lives in a global age. It provides in-depth analysis of a range of international <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of disaster, war, conflict, migration and celebration. The book explores how images, stories and voices, on television, the Internet, and in advertisements and newspapers, invite us to relocate to distant contexts, and to relate to people who are remote from our daily lives, by developing ‘mediated intimacy’ and focusing on the self. It also explores how these representations shape our self-narratives. Orgad examines five sites of <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> – the other, the nation, possible lives, the world and the self. She argues that representations can and should contribute to fostering more ambivalence and complexity in how we think and feel about the world, our place in it and our relation to far-away others. <b>Media</b> <b>Representations</b> and the Global Imagination will be of particular interest to students and scholars of media and cultural studies, as well as sociology, politics, international relations, development studies and migration studies...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines narratives about racialized gender, sexuality, {{and class}} through media images of black Americans with HIV/AIDS. Through textual analysis of media sites featuring HIV/AIDS and blackness (The Announcement, Precious, and Marvelyn Brown’s website, www. marvelynbrown. com), this project analyzes how {{the politics of}} respectability—a set of precepts that govern how {{black men and women}} can present themselves in public spaces to align with white ideals of gender and sexuality—construct black people in <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS. This work examines how respectability politics deployed in <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS and black Americans reclaim notions of acceptable black sexuality by reifying age-old stereotypes of black masculinity femininity. I argue that the goal of respectability politics in countering anti-blackness through limited parameters for acceptable presentations of racialized gender and sexuality continue to challenge and complicate <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS and black Americans...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, {{millions}} of people born between the late 1970 s and the late 1990 s have been categorized as “millennials. ” A media discourse tells people what a millennial is and is not, shaping how those people it depicts as “millen-nial ” may perceive themselves and how others perceive them. This paper examines four <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the millennial: a member of a youth cohort, a consumer, a worker to be managed, and an immiserated victim of hard times. It argues that these four <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the millennial distort the capitalist determinations of millennial life and labour and prevent the millennials from seeing themselves as part of the working class. By way of a critique of these four ideological <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the class-less millennial, the paper forwards a historical-materialist account of the millennial working class in a new capitalist millennium...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, feminists began to raise {{awareness}} about intimate partner violence (IPV), transforming it from a private family matter into a social problem. Popular <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of IPV, which exposed the extent and severity of the problem, {{played a key role}} in this transition. Surprisingly, however, there has been very little research on <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of IPV or intimate partner homicide (IPH). This thesis conducts a critical discourse analysis on recent <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of abused women who kill their abusive partners in law procedural dramas, a genre of television that both commands a wide prime-time audience and impacts viewers’ understanding of the legal system. I argue that the common representational tropes used in these episodes actively harm abused women by constructing only abuse narratives that reinforce misogynistic tropes as valid and by suggesting that the legal system meets abused women’s needs...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH REPORT OF JESSICA EDMOND, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} MASS COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA ARTS, {{presented}} on March 31, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: THE PROMOTION OF SKIN BLEACHING PRODUCTS IN JAMAICA: <b>MEDIA</b> <b>REPRESENTATION</b> AND CULTURAL IMPACT MAJOR PROFESSOR: William Freivogel and Phil Greer Through television commercials, print and digital advertisements, magazines, billboards, and the internet, the ideal skin complexion represented in Jamaican media is fair-skin tones. This idea that fair skin is better is common among other {{cultures in the}} world and is spreading to developed as well as developing nations worldwide. This study looks at different literature dealing with the effects of viewing <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> among women in Jamaica. This study found that there was greater complexion dissatisfaction among darker skinned women, but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this was a direct result of consuming <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> print, audio, television, magazines, etc of the subject...|$|R
40|$|Volunteers play a {{major role}} in mega and major events, both {{cultural}} and sporting, contributing invaluable human resources. Frequently described (and, maybe, over-emphasised) as the ‘unsung heroes’ of such events, relatively little is known about this group of workers when compared with volunteers who give regular and long-term commitment to their area of interest. This paper focuses on <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> and perceptions of volunteering at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. The exploratory study adopts an extended timeframe and reports on <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of volunteers over the full event cycle from recruitment through training and the actual event, concluding with consideration of the Games' aftermath. The findings highlight various positive and negative aspects of the <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of volunteering at this type of mega event and how this has the potential to influence its public face. Conclusions focus on the implications for the media management of volunteering at major events and suggestions for future research in this area. ...|$|R
