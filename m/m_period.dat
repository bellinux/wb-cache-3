40|$|We {{describe}} opto-electronic LC spatial light modulators {{which allow}} {{the generation of}} alterable diffraction gratings down to a 1 mu <b>m</b> <b>period.</b> Optically defined binary and blaze phase gratings are used, in which the diffraction is altered by a parallel aligned nematic LC phase modulation layer. This enables the creation of arbitrary fine-pitch gratings. Different types of modulators have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical results show that, {{in the case of}} small grating structures, the exact wave theory has to be applied to calculate the diffraction properties. The grating modulation then becomes dependent on the light polarisation and the grating period. Modulators with gratings of 1 to 10 mu <b>m</b> <b>period</b> have been fabricated.

40|$|Conference Name:Conference on Holography - Advances and Modern Trends. Conference Address: Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC. Time:APR 21 - 23, 2009. Small-angle beam {{deviation}} {{has many}} applications and is conventionally performed by wedge prisms. The usual method {{suffers from a}} disadvantage that the manufacturing tolerances limit the resolution to about an arc second. The paper presents a new technique of using low frequency gratings to realize small-angle beam deviation with higher resolution. By rotating a grating placed in the laser beam path, the deviation of the diffracted light beams can be controlled. Using the proposed method, very small beam deviation angle can be achieved under large grating rotation angle, resulting in high reduction ratio. Theoretical analysis shows {{that as long as}} the grating period is large enough, the reduction ratio can be much higher than that given by a wedge prism.

Distinctly different log-normal distributions of the 8 -h averages were observed for "trafficked" sites versus "urban park" sites, with mean values of 1. 6 and 1. 0 ppm respectively.

40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of Internal Revenue Code Section 162 (m), which caps a public company 2 ̆ 7 s {{corporate}} income tax deduction at 1 million per year for amounts paid to each of its top five executives, on CEO compensation level, CEO compensation structure and pay for performance sensitivity. I find that the average level of CEO salary decreased after the implementation of Section 162 (m) and that firms that paid their CEOs salary no less than 1 million have constrained their CEO salary growth after Section 162 (m). However, the level of CEO total compensation does not follow the same trend as the level of CEO salary. In particular, the average total compensation increased after enactment of Section 162 (m) and the increases in bonuses and equity-based compensation were main contributions to the upward trend of total compensation. To examine whether Section 162 (m) create closer association between pay and performance, I examine whether performance sensitivity of CEO bonuses and total compensation increased after Section 162 (m). I do not find evidence to support the position that pay-for-performance sensitivity has changed after Section 162 (m) compared to that before Section 162 (m). I then further probe the long-term effect of Section 162 (m) on pay-for-performance sensitivity. I find the firms most likely to be affected by the tax regulation showing increased sensitivity of total compensation growth to sales growth and ROA growth over the later post-Section 162 (<b>m)</b> <b>period</b> compared to the earlier post-Section 162 (<b>m)</b> <b>period.</b> My finding provides evidence that firms most likely to be affected by this tax code, in order to preserve their tax deductibility, will more likely to comply with the recently adopted rules and legislation (regulations imposed after the Enron- era). Overall, my results suggest that firms that paid their CEOs salaries more than 1 million have constrained their fixed salary growth after Section 162 (m), while the average total compensation actually increased after Section 162 (m). Also, such firms are more likely to alter their CEO compensation package by using more performance related compensation than using fixed salary. According to my results, there are no significant differences in pay-for-performance sensitivity before and after Section 162 (m), but I document a long-term effect of Section 162 (m) on pay-for-performance sensitivity...|$|E

The experiment {{was carried out}} in a randomized complete design following a repeated measure arrangement (three experimental periods) with three replications of two leaf blade masses (600 and 1, 000 kg/ha DM), which were maintained using continuous grazing with variable stocking rate. The variables measured were sward height, herbage mass, leaf blade and stem bulk density in sward vertical strata (sward structural characteristics), grazing, idling, rumination time and bite rate of heifers (ingestive behaviour). Bite rate was modified by pasture management and was lower when the leaf blade mass was 1, 000 kg/ha DM. The daily grazing, rumination and idling time of beef heifers were similar for both leaf blade masses. Structural variation of the sward, during the experimental period, altered the grazing, rumination and idling time of heifers, and affected the bite rate.
