5|$|In January 2011, Falle {{appeared}} at the Party for Freedom at York University in Toronto, which launched the Alliance Against <b>Modern</b> <b>Slavery,</b> a nonprofit organization seeking to combat human trafficking through partnerships, education, and research. Falle was joined by Glendene Grant, human trafficking victim Jessie Foster's mother; Kevin Bales, co-founder and president of Free the Slaves; Kate Todd, a singer-songwriter and actor; Janelle Belgrave of Samba Elégua Drummers and Peace Concept; Roger Cram of Hiram College; and Jeff Gunn, a guitarist. That September, Falle attended Toronto's second annual Freedom Walk, which was hosted by Stop Child Trafficking Now, Freedom Relay Canada, and Oakville's Free-Them. At this event aimed at raising awareness about human trafficking nationally and internationally, Falle was joined by other abolitionists including Tara Teng, who was Miss Canada at the time; Trisha Baptie, co-founder of EVE; Shae Invidiata, founder of Free-Them; Timea Nagy; Constable Lepa Jankovic; MP Joy Smith; MP Olivia Chow; and MP Terence Young.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became {{interested}} in Africa from Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and from the photographs of George Rodger. She visited Kenya {{for the first time}} in 1956 and later Sudan, where she photographed Nuba tribes with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily. Even though her film project about <b>modern</b> <b>slavery</b> entitled Die Schwarze Fracht ("The Black Cargo") was never completed, Riefenstahl was able to sell the stills from the expedition to magazines in various parts of the world. While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a Nairobi hospital, she finished writing the script, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the Suez Canal crisis and bad weather. In the end, the film project was called off. Even so, Riefenstahl was granted Sudanese citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.|$|E

[...] With this goal in mind, Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries, an East Bloomfield, New York-based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar: The Cry of Reason, which documents internal resistance to South African apartheid by way of Beyers Naudé's story; and A Closer Walk, which is about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Costa e-mailed Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, asking him to create the film he envisioned.

Ted Baehr of Movieguide, a Christian magazine, called the film [...] "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" [...] and wrote that it was amazing that the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the cinematography, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The Movieguide review ends by comparing the film's opposition to <b>modern</b> <b>slavery</b> to the death of Saint Telemachus, which put an end to gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of Star News Daily called the film [...] "controversial".|$|E

500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to <b>modern</b> <b>slavery.</b> [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

40|$|Particularly {{since the}} passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, academics, policy makers, and the media have come to {{appreciate}} the magnitude and scope of human trafficking and <b>modern</b> day <b>slavery.</b> Yet, there exists little empirical work on the subject. In the most comprehensive assessment of the literature to date, the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University concluded that “quantitative methodologies” are noticeably scarce and that “the dominant anti-trafficking discourse is not evidence based. ” Part of {{this is due to the}} difficulty in obtaining reliable data with which to test empirically falsifiable models. In this paper, we develop a novel measure of <b>modern</b> day <b>slavery</b> that fills this gap. We build our measure based on a research project carried out by Pennington, Ball, Hampton and Soulakova in 2006. Using their insights, we construct a cross-national measure for slavery in one hundred and sixty-one countries for 2010. Next, we test the hypothesis that, among a number of plausible explanations, levels of corruption in each state best explain current levels of slavery. We find that corruption is a powerful predictor. We conclude our discussion with outlining a new research agenda based on an empirical understanding of <b>modern</b> day <b>slavery...</b>|$|R
