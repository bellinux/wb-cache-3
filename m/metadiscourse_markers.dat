In order {{to carry out}} this research project 20 news reports were selected by dint of random sampling from a corpus of 38 news reports taken from 5 Persian news agencies. To investigate <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers,</b> Vande Kopple’s (1985) original classification system for metadiscourse or metatextual functions based on Halliday’s functions of language was utilized. Sample Persian equivalents for Kopple’s <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were suggested by the researcher. The findings indicated that <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> are quite frequent in Persian news reports suggesting their importance in this genre. Moreover, this study revealed that there are more instances of textual <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in comparison with interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> Finally, this research endeavor demonstrated that text connectives, narrators, and commentary markers are more abundant than other kinds of metadiscourse...|$|E

These conclusion sections were categorized into two groups of male and female writers: 15 conclusion sections belonged to male writers and other 15 conclusion sections belonged to female writers. The interactive and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were counted and analyzed to find if male or female writers utilize these <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> differently or similarly in conclusion sections of English disciplines (Translation, Teaching, and Literature). These <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were analyzed descriptively and referentially. The descriptive analysis show that both male and female writers in Translation, Teaching and Literature applied more interactional markers than interactive ones. In Translation and Teaching, female writers used more interactional resources comparing to male writers. But, in Literature, male writers employed more interactional markers than female writers. The referential statistics indicate that in English Translation and English Literature, there are significant differences between male and female writers concerning use of Interactive and Interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>Markers,</b> while in English Teaching, there are not any significant differences between male and female writers regarding use of these <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>Markers...</b>|$|E

The study has been conducted in three steps. The first part focuses on the theory and categorization of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers,</b> followed by an analysis of the use and development of these markers in learners of L 2 Spanish. The second part deals with the categorization and operationalization of aspects of fluency and conversational participation that can be {{associated with the use of}} metadiscourse markers; followed by an analysis of these aspects in the performance of the learners. The third part of the study is a summary of the results obtained and a discussion of the relationship between the use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> and the development of fluency and conversational participation. The data underlying the current study consists of a selection of 17 recorded conversations between learners of L 2 Spanish and native speakers of Spanish taken from the AKSAM database. The conversations belong in two activity types: discussions and simulated negotiations. The selected sample has a duration of approx. 10 hours and comprises 87   683 words. The study focuses on nine learners who have been recorded at the beginning and at the end of their five month study-abroad stay. Results show that frequency of use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> has increased considerably at the end of the stay in the majority of the learners under study. A qualitative development can also be found, through which the <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> that characterize the learners’ L 1 and/or interlanguage have been substituted by more target-like expressions. Furthermore, both their fluency and level of conversational participation have generally increased. Within this development, however, a notable individual variation can be found. The learners who show the strongest development as regards fluency and conversational participation are also found to exhibit the most salient development of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> Since disfluency is reduced to a lesser degree in those participants who also exhibit a less developed use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers,</b> it is argued that the development of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in the L 2 learner runs parallel to the development of discourse skills, but also that acquiring an adequate use of metadiscourse markers helps developing these skills. ...|$|E

The data, graded by teacher-raters as between A to C grades using an in-house can-do scale for successful academic stance, interaction and comprehensibility, was annotated for 22 error types, an exhaustive range of interactive and interpersonal metadiscourse (following Hyland, 2005) {{and a range}} of temporal, prosodic, lexical and syntactic markers (or 'fluencemes') of (dis) fluency (following Götz, 2013). The results suggest that successful, frequent use of <b>metadiscourse</b> (particularly engagement <b>markers</b> and topic shifts) is the primary indicator of raters' positive evaluation of student performance in L 2 academic tutorial discussion alongside temporal fluencemes (namely speech rate per minute). Identical repeats and errors of idiom / collocation are salient to raters' negative appraisals, while other L 2 errors and other individual prosodic (e. g. pauses), lexical (e. g. reformulations) and syntactic fluencemes (e. g. interrupted structures, dependent clauses) do not particularly feature in raters' positive (or negative) evaluations.

Hyland (2004) argued that a valuable means of exploring academic writing, and comparing the rhetorical features and preferences of different discourse communities, is through the metadiscourse analysis of the text. The present study examines {{the differences in the}} use, type, and frequency of interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in the introduction and conclusion sections of research papers across the two disciplines of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. To this end, 42 research articles (21 Mechanical and 21 Electrical Engineering) written by English native speakers were randomly selected from two major international journals. The current study made use of Hyland’s (2005) model for analyzing the interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> used in the selected corpus, consisting of 41484 words. To analyze the data, the frequency, patterns of use, and type of interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were elicited both through a manual corpus analysis and concordance package.

The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors.

Since metadiscourse is a rhetorical device, it could be different based on the user’s culture and mother tongue. In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al.

The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian academic writers. To find the significant difference among the three corpora, the researchers used chi-square test. The findings of analyzing about 9000 lines of 26 published research articles on ELT and theoretical linguistics revealed the native Persian academic writers used interactive <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in their L 1 writings more than the native English and non-native English academic writers (Iranian) whereas they used the least number of interactional metadiscourse (with the exception of self mentions). It was interesting that Persian academic writers used the most number of interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> when they wrote in L 2 (English). Regarding the other variable of the study i. e. gender, the findings further proved no relevance between gender and metadiscourse marker...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} article {{is one of}} the widely practiced genres of communication among members of academic discourse community to contribute their own new knowledge and get acceptance from the audience. A generic analysis of {{research article}}s can cover a wide variety of issues; among them rhetorical features. As argued by Hyland (2004), a valuable means of exploring academic writing and of comparing the rhetorical features and preferences of different discourse communities is through metadiscoursal analysis. Metadiscourse is an aspect of language which provides a link between texts and disciplinary cultures, helping to define the rhetorical context by revealing some of the expectations and understandings of the audience for whom a text is written. Differences in metadiscourse patterns may prove to be an essential means of distinguishing discourse communities (Hyland, 1998). The present paper focused on interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in the result and discussion section of academic research articles across four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Civil Engineering, Biology, and Economics. Sixteen research article result and discussion sections (4 from each discipline) were sourced from four leading international journals for analysis. Results revealed that there were worth-pointing differences, but not statistically significant differences excepting in terms of boosters, between disciplines in the use of interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> Similarities and differences are explained by way of an explication of genre features in terms of contextual configuration and genre specific needs dealing with applied <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> by discipline...|$|E

It employs Hyland and Tse’s model and Hyland’s model for the multimodal analysis of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in finance texts. The findings show a high frequency of interactive and interactional markers in the orthographic texts compared with a lack of implicit interactive markers and a high frequency of implicit interactional markers in the tables and graphs. Implications for the teaching of English for Business Purposes (EBP) are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{motivated}} {{to examine the}} role of interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> such as hedges and boosters. In order to illuminate this relation, 27 front pages of widely read newspapers in US. were selected randomly from around 50 news about 9 / 11 events. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to answer the research questions to identify the frequency of hedge and booster employment. Moreover, to determine the supposedly meaningful differences between hedge and booster application in the corpus, the chi-square test was used. The findings showed that hedges were {{the most frequently used}} <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in English front page news articles. As the subcategories of hedging devices, probability adverbs occupied the highest position, while verbs as booster subcategories, were the most numerous devices used to describe writers ’ certainty. It was concluded that journalists preferred to be conservative by using indirect strategies like adverbs and adjective employment about controversial issues like 9 / 11...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyValidation in language testing is an ongoing process in which information is collected through investigations into the design, implementation, products and impacts of an assessment (Sireci, 2007). This includes the cognitive processes elicited from candidates by a test (Weir, 2005). This study investigated the English Speaking Board’s ESOL International examinations at levels B 2 and C 1 of the CEFR. The study considered the role of discourse competence in successful performances through examination of cognitive phases employed by candidates and <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> and whether the use fit with models such as the CEFR and Field (2004) and so contributed to the validation argument. The study had two strands. The process strand {{of the study was}} largely qualitative and focussed on the cognitive processes which candidates used to compose their texts. Verbal reports were carried out with a total of twelve participants, six at each level. The product strand of the study analysed the use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> in the scripts of sixty candidates in order to identify developing features of discourse competence at levels B 2 and C 1. The process strand of the study identified that there were statistically significant differences in the cognitive phases employed by the participants in the study. The investigation also identified a number of differences in what B 2 and C 1 learners attended to while carrying out the different phases. The product strand of the study found no statistically significant differences in the use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> used by candidates at the two levels, but observed differences in the way particular <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were employed. These differences indicate the direction for a possible larger-scale study. Unlike previous studies into metadiscourse (Burneikaite, 2008; Plakans, 2009; Bax, Nataksuhara & Waller, forthcoming) the study controlled for task, text type and rhetorical pattern and nationality. The study suggested that discourse competence contributed to higher-level performances in writing and that the examinations under investigation elicited a wide range of cognitive phases from C 1 candidates. The study also suggested that many of the CEFR’s statements about the development of discourse competence at the higher levels are correct...|$|E

Four teacher raters’ retrospective verbal reports of their rating processes, text-based interviews and semi-structured interviews {{in relation to the}} students’ use of metadiscourse have been examined. The research findings demonstrate that the teacher raters commented more on the fulfillment of the cohesive and the rhetorical functions of metadiscourse rather than upon the pragmatic functions of metadiscourse per se...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} investigate the degree of students ’ achievement in reading comprehension in English as a foreign language through explicit instruction in <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> For this purpose, 80 students studying at a language school (placed at intermediate levels of English language proficiency) were chosen {{to participate in the}} experiment. Every possible measure was taken to ensure that the participants lacked enough knowledge about metadiscourse. The participants were then randomly divided into four equal groups each containing twenty students. The first experimental group (EG 1) included twenty participants who received instructions in both textual and interpersonal metadiscourse. The second experimental group (EG 2) received instructions in only textual <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> The third experimental group (EG 3) received instructions in only interpersonal metadiscourse. The control group received no specific instructions in metadiscourse and was only exposed to some input enhancement material and relevant exercises. As a result of running a number of statistical procedures, instruction on metadiscourse revealed a positive effect on the participants ’ achievement in reading comprehension in English. The results of the study have some implications for materials designers; they can improve a learner’s ability to understand and remember information from the text by improving it textually and interpersonally...|$|E
30|$|The {{interactional}} {{aspect of}} metadiscourse {{deals with the}} way the authors interact with their readers and engage them. Thus, intensity markers (IMs) fulfill interpersonal functions in RAs and can be regarded as <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> According to Quirk et al.' (1985) model of IMs, these markers are classified into three major classes of emphasizers, amplifiers, and downtoners. Crismore et al. (1993) also viewed intensity markers are one type of metadiscourses which actualizes interpersonal functions. They also stated that IMs display the communicative value of the discourse and writers’ stance toward the proposition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to {{the crucial}} role of {{utilizing}} interpersonal resources in facilitating the process of written communication and establishment of intimate social relations between writers and readers, {{the present study was}} designed to explore the effect of audience awareness-raising on EFL learners’ use of interpersonal resources in essay writing. For this purpose, 20 EFL learners studying at Maravia Institute in Maragheh (placed at upper-intermediate levels of English language proficiency) were chosen {{on the basis of their}} performance in an Oxford Placement Test (OPT) to participate in the experiment. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of experimental and control. Both groups received instruction on writing for seven sessions. The given instruction was the same for each group: seven modes of development in essay writing were taught (Narration, Description, Example, Classification & Division, Compare & Contrast, Process, and Cause & Effect). <b>Metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> were also taught implicitly in the examples of each mode. The audience awareness was highlighted in the writing assignments of the experimental group by specifying a specific audience for each topic provided, while in the control group this awareness-raising was missing. Following Hyland's (2005) typology of metadiscourse, the collected data were analyzed on the basis of each groups’ use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers.</b> The findings revealed that the frequency of metadiscourse resources was different in two groups. This indicates that raising audience awareness was influential in metadiscourse use of EFL learners...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study explores to {{what extent}} {{multilingual}} learners’ production of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> (MMs) may be related in three languages present in their school curriculum, and how instructional input influences their choices and production of accurate forms. Twenty-two secondary school students wrote opinion essays in English, Catalan, and Spanish. MM use was analysed following Hyland's (2000) classification. Our {{results showed that the}} same categories of MMs were used in the three languages, although there was more variety in Catalan and Spanish. Moreover, learners mostly relied on the forms present in the input, and 90 % of these forms were accurately used in the three languages...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a corpus-based study aimed at {{an analysis of}} ontological and terminological commitments in the discourse of specialist communities. The analyzed corpus contains the lectures delivered by the Nobel Prize winners in Physics and Economics. The analysis focuses on (a) the collocational use of automatically identified domain-specific terms and (b) a description of metadiscourse in the lectures. Candidate terms are extracted based on the z-score of frequency and weirdness. Compounds comprising these candidate terms are then identified using the ontology representation system Protégé. This method is then replicated to complete analysis by including an investigation of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> signalling how writers project themselves into their work. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a descriptive analysis of discourse structuring devices in written texts. It discusses typologies of metadiscourse (Hyland, 1998; Hyland and Tse, 2004) and establishes a categorisation of organisational <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers,</b> i. e. linguistic items that signpost the discourse organisation on the metadiscourse level. One particular group of these markers, sequencers, will be defined more precisely and described by means of a qualitative analysis of their structural parameters. A manual corpus analysis (Degand and Bestgen, 2004), allying quantitative and qualitative analyses, gives a detailed picture of their actual use in written discourse and of their distribution among the three text genres of academic writing, journalese and fiction.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the rhetorical pattern (RP) of the introduction section of the scripts written by Acehnese undergraduate students studying in four different universities in Aceh. The focus {{of this study is}} on three elements: placement of the thesis, patterns of idea, and <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> of the introduction section. Literature has reported a number of findings regarding the RP; however, information about this in undergraduate level, particularly in state universities in Aceh, is still limited. This study was conducted qualitatively by employing content analysis to identify the RP. A number of introduction sections of students’ scripts from four selected universities in Aceh were collected and analysed. The result shows the dominance of the three elements in the introduction section...|$|E
40|$|Inevitability {{of using}} {{evidentials}} (EVs) and references in all academic writings signifies {{the importance of}} distinguishing and applying EVs for those who attempt to write in academic prose. With the aim of creating a unique model of EVs in academic texts, this study used well-established taxonomies of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>markers</b> adapted by Hyland (2005) combined with Swales' (1990) classification of citations as well as Berkenkotter and Huckin's (1995) concept of intertexuality in academic writing. The proposed model yields at least two important advantages. First, it can develop a pattern of the uses of EVs in academic texts, thus deepening {{our understanding of the}} organization of such texts. Second, it has potential applications in pedagogy for those students who attempt to write in academic prose and for scholars, teachers, and material developers...|$|E
