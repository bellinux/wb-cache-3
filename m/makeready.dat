40|$|It is more {{important}} than ever for printers to improve efficiency and productivity, and the means for doing so are available. Computer-assisted scheduling is one method that is claimed to increase throughput speed and reduce costs, among other benefits. Recently, scheduling applications have started to increase in popularity, and many management information systems (MISs) have built-in scheduling features. However, only 15 % of the companies that own scheduling software utilize it. The first part of this research project seeks to determine the reasons for the low usage. Another way to increase efficiency is through Lean manufacturing, a strategy for eliminating non-value-added activities, such as defects, excess inventory, and overproduction. Lean manufacturing and computer-assisted scheduling share many of the same objectives. The second part of the research project seeks {{to determine whether or not}} there is a difference in production performance between users and nonusers of scheduling software from a lean manufacturing perspective. The analysis is based on data collected through an email questionnaire from 60 commercial printing companies in the U. S. It was found that the surveyed companies who own scheduling software but do not use it, do not rely on the application’s capability because they believe that they can achieve better control with manual scheduling. Furthermore, they believe scheduling software is difficult to integrate with their workflow. Companies who have owned an MIS for 5 years or fewer have a more negative perception about scheduling software compared with those who have owned one for a longer time. In the research, it was also found that companies using scheduling software have higher utilization rates of equipment, shorter lead times for paper storage, and a higher percentage of short <b>makereadies</b> out of the total number of makreadies. Nonusers of scheduling software have shorter throughput time and shorter waiting time for a job between preflighting and platemaking, between platemaking and plate mounting, and between completed printing and the first postpress operation. In general, the scheduling software users in the study are more homogeneous as a group in performance, whereas the nonusers are more diverse in performance, with a relatively high percentage performing at a very low or very high level. The implication of the study is that scheduling software needs to be more userfriendly and easier to customize to increase the flexibility and capability of integrating it into a workflow. Furthermore, companies that own scheduling software, but do not use it, should investigate the possibility of achieving better performance by beginning to use the scheduling application. Scheduling software that is already in house has the capability of enhancing a lean manufacturing effort...|$|R

The bitmap data can be reloaded via the direct imaging server, reimaged on press, and run normally on press. Direct imaging plates are nonphotographic, contain no hazardous waste, and can be recycled through normal aluminum-recycling channels.|$|E

50|$|Letterpress {{can produce}} work {{of high quality}} at high speed, but it {{requires}} much time to adjust the press for varying thicknesses of type, engravings, and plates called <b>makeready.</b> The process requires {{a high degree of}} craftsmanship, but in the right hands, letterpress excels at fine typography. It is used by many small presses that produce fine, handmade, limited-edition books, artists' books, and high-end ephemera such as greeting cards and broadsides. Because of the time needed to make letterpress plates and to prepare the press, setting type by hand has become less common with the invention of the photopolymer plate, a photosensitive plastic sheet that can be mounted on metal to bring it up to type high.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focused on}} determining whether specific process improvement methodologies {{performed in a}} Kaizen event could reduce the overall <b>makeready</b> process in a platen die cutting operation. Data was collected and analyzed {{in order to identify}} opportunities that would reduce the effort (procedure steps and time) within the <b>makeready</b> procedure. Analysis was conducted on the <b>makeready</b> procedure at a packaging company in Rochester, New York. The researcher worked with the Center for Excellence in Lean Enterprise (CELE) at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in conducting the Kaizen event. An initial analysis {{with the use of a}} 5 S audit and Individual X-Chart was conducted in order to qualify the types of process improvements that would later be implemented during the Kaizen event. Video recording and spaghetti-mapping diagrams were prepared during the <b>makeready</b> analysis. The information from these two process improvement analysis techniques revealed procedure improvements that were captured during the research. This research revealed opportunities for a Bobst SP- 102 E platen die cutting machine <b>makeready</b> process by removing the excessive motion to develop a more effective <b>makeready</b> process. With the use of process improvement methodologies in the print manufacturing environment, company leaders can utilize the research methodology as a guideline to reduce an operation 2 ̆ 7 s <b>makeready</b> time, and thereby reduce costs of manufacturing by eliminating waste in the operation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the {{feasibility}} of quantitatively pre-setting the ink key distribution on an off-set press. Presently the pre-settings of the ink keys has been left to the pressmens 2 ̆ 7 ability and experience. This, in many cases, involves much 2 ̆ 2 trial and error 2 ̆ 2 work along with lengthy <b>makeready</b> times. This study attempted to reduce <b>makeready</b> time by quantitatively pre-setting ink keys from data obtained from an estimating unit and use of a set of calibration curves. A photoelectric estimating unit was designed and constructed to read integrated densities of copy to be printed. There was one reading for each area of copy corresponding to an ink key on the press. The estimating unit consisted of a series of lenses, a photoelectric tube and a meter movement. The estimating unit yielded readings of the image area for which an ink key is responsible for the supply of ink. The press was a standard off-set type with small paper dials mounted on the face of each ink key. A series of calibration tints were printed. From these tints key settings and their estimated density values curves were generated for use in the pre-setting of the ink keys for any type of copy. Through one test it was found that there are many ways to have the ink keys set and still have the job within specifications. The reasons for this are explained within. Sample copy was read using the estimating unit. Through a series of steps predicted ink key settings were found. This copy was then printed using the ink key pre-settings. All press runs were evaluated to determine whether or not the pre-settings were producing printed copy within specifications. One hundred and ten possible ink key pre-settings were attempted. The results of the study show good correlation between pre-setting ink keys and actual settings done entirely empirically. With a quantitative method pre-setting the ink distribution keys, the <b>makeready</b> time required will be shorter...|$|E
40|$|Those {{who study}} lean {{manufacturing}} know that waste comes in many forms. We must remind ourselves {{that anything that}} does not produce exactly what the customer values, when it is needed, is a wasteful operation. Makereadies, or press setups, are wasteful, {{at least in the}} eyes of our customers. Reducing press setup time is critical for improving customer value and making the printer more competitive on short-runs while increasing overall productivity. Even though make-ready time is built into an estimate, {{the bottom line is that}} it isn’t something a customer is delighted about paying for. Reducing <b>makeready</b> time, therefore, becomes a strategy that improves competitiveness in the marketplace...|$|E

Information about corrections made on press can be fed back into the ink kitchen and pre-press workflow. This provides an opportunity to help reduce <b>makeready</b> times for future similar press runs. Inline color measurement {{is part of a}} broader quality control workflow that allows the printer to understand the intricate relationships between inks (color, viscosity, temperature, pH, etc.) and press conditions (including pressure, run speed, anilox or cylinder engraving conditions, etc.). Thoroughly understanding these relationships, and how they affect the quality and efficiency of a print run, is key to optimizing the printing process and maximizing bottom line performance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Designers {{are found}} {{all over the}} United States: From large, urban {{settings}} (such as Seattle) to smaller, more isolated settings, such as my hometown back in Indiana. Through my research I discovered that professional designers across the country, regardless of their settings, are struggling. With the ever-shifting landscape of design and the expectation to stay current, they are lacking daily opportunities to learn new skills and are feeling isolated from a local and continuous creative community of their peers, an integral aspect of design culture. My thesis addresses these predicaments with <b>MakeReady</b> Initiative, a scalable and customizable service that is dedicated to designers and their creative potential. This service is dispensed through a guidebook that helps designers across the country set up these creative communities that empower designers to connect through knowledge that they not only need, but want, so they can better their lives...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic {{development}} {{which has}} sparked flexography {{is the introduction}} and use of photopolymer plates. These plates have simplified flexographic printing by {{reducing the amount of}} time and effort needed to prepare plates for press and <b>makeready.</b> An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of commonly used solvent mixtures on flexographic plates. The plates tested include those using natural rubber, Buna N, and various photopolymers. The experiment specifically studied change in hardness of these plate materials due to immersion in different solvent mixtures over time. Noticeable differances in the degree of softening of plates was observed after 24 hours of immersion. Differences in the degree of softening were found in the plates after soaking in different percents of solvents. It was also discovered what percents of different lactol spirits and normal propyl acetate added to alcohol would affect the plates the most. Further, these differences were detectable at different periods of time. Most plates softened with time. One plate softened to such a degree with the solvent of this experiment that it was difficult to determine which solvents had a significant effect. This, of course, {{is due to the fact}} that solvents compatible with this plate were not used in this experiment. All photopolymer plates performed poorly in acetates, but it would be possible to use acetates with these plates over short periods of time on small press runs. When using flexographic plates of the composition tested in this experiment it is recommended that the practitioner use less than five percent of lactol or ten percent normal propyl acetate for a minimum affect on these plates over a short period of time...|$|E
40|$|Background and Significance New {{technologies}} {{within the}} printing industry open new challenges, enable innovative ways of reaching prospective clients and bring ever more stringent demands to both graphic designers and printers. Printers must implement the emerging technologies that best suit their customers and the evolving {{needs of the}} marketplace; designers must acquaint themselves with new technologies and learn to design {{with respect to the}} output device to make best use of the equipment. A short step beyond desktop technology are digital printing systems, 2 ̆ 2 the culmination of many technologies that have been in various stages of development for over 20 years and have finally caught up with each other. 2 ̆ 21 Digital printers are capable of printing 2 ̆ 2 directly from digital information residing in an electronic file on a computer, 2 ̆ 22 2 ̆ 2 bypassing the multiple and time-consuming steps of film output, proofing, imposition and plate-making required by traditional methods. 2 ̆ 23 As of today, digital printing is targeted to the short-run and on-demand segments of the industry. 2 ̆ 2 Eventually, digital approaches will apply to just every facet of graphic communication, whether it has to a run of 1, 000, 000 or just one. 2 ̆ 24 Statement of The Problem The all-time myth roaming in pressrooms that designers know nothing about printing is not entirely untrue. Often, a design is finished and approved in a studio without the minimal consideration for printing and finishing. The consolidation of a digital workflow today in the printing industry increases the need for designers to acknowledge printing in their brainstorming sessions to create designs that can be produced through emerging technologies. By doing so, they can reduce problems associated with file transfer and output such as missing images and typefaces. The ease of operation of digital presses that can receive a file and print much as a desktop printer does makes them highly attractive to designers and entrepreneurs, providing these a means for printing without all the <b>makeready</b> procedures associated with traditional printing processes. Statement of The Project Goals The purpose of this thesis project is to evaluate the color reproduction of digital printing systems most common in industry through the creation of a universal test instrument with respect to which all the systems will be compared. The results of the test will be used to assess the capabilities of the equipment and determine their ideal applications within the graphic communications industry. A file preparation and specification guide for each of the devices tested will be compiled. The audience at which this study is targeted is graphic designers, who could benefit by learning about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various systems and learning to design with these in mind. As a result, particular attention will be paid to the impact these emerging technologies have in designers 2 ̆ 7 approach to producing their work. This thesis project does not suggest the equipment to be tested is the best in the market place. Its results, however, may be used in determining which system is most suitable for implementation. Methodology This thesis project will provide a color reproduction evaluation and comprehensive guides for designers to prepare and expedite files to the following digital presses: Xeikon DCP- 32 D Indigo E-Print 1000 Xerox DocuColor 40 Heidelberg Quickmaster-DI The criterium defining the color reproduction evaluation and the elements used in the test instrument is the following: Graphic designers, the audience at which this thesis project is targeted, think in terms of memory colors; red, green, and blue. As a result, the elements comprising the test instrument will be those which designers deal with: text and images. The printed samples will be measured with a X-Rite 938 spectrodensitometer, and the results will be complemented with a visual evaluation done under standard lighting conditions. Test Instrument The test instrument will be comprised of the following: CMYK patches and bars 4 -color black patches Images of different sources and resolutions Line art Type Overprinting circles Color bars RIT Neutral Balance Target for SWOP RIT 4 -Color Spokes Target Evaluation Tone reproduction Solid ink density Total ink density Gray balance Dot gain Resolution Ghosting The second part to this thesis project will involve the compilation of guides to expedite files to each output device.
