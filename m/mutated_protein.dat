25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B {{seems to be}} to lower the amount of protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and is responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a phosphodiester bond between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is <b>mutated.</b> <b>Protein</b> A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X viral DNA in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the viral DNA in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the burst size of the virus.|$|E

40|$|The oligoadenylate {{synthetase}} (OAS) is {{well known}} as an antiviral factor against the flavivirus infection in mammals. It is known that the oligoadenylate synthetase-like (ChOAS-L) gene is only present in the chicken genome. It {{has been shown in}} the previous report that the ChOAS-L possesses enzymatic activity to convert ATP into 2 '- 5 '-linked oligoadenylates and antiviral activity against West Nile virus (WNV) replicon. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between enzymatic and antiviral activities of ChOAS-L. Eight <b>mutated</b> ChOAS-L <b>proteins</b> were generated using either the site-directed mutagenesis or standard polymerase chain reaction protocol.

However, all <b>mutated</b> <b>proteins</b> showed antiviral activity to inhibit the replication of the WNV replicon except for ChOAS-L-A Delta UbL 1 /UbL 2, which showed a partial inhibition compared to the wild-type ChOAS-L-A or other <b>mutated</b> <b>proteins.</b> These results suggest that the ChOAS-L expresses the antiflavivirus activity in a manner independent of enzymatic activity.

To determine which residues of this 200 -amino-acid domain are important for these activities, single conservative amino acid substitutions have been generated in 17 residues that are invariant among all papillomavirus E 2 <b>proteins.</b> The resulting <b>mutated</b> E 2 <b>proteins</b> were {{tested for the ability}} to support viral DNA replication, activate transcription, and cooperatively bind to the origin of replication with the E 1 protein.

40|$|Abstract Background Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV- 1) gene {{expression}} {{is thought to}} shut off recombinant {{gene expression}} from HSV- 1 vectors; however, in a helper virus-free HSV- 1 vector system, a number of promoters support only short-term expression. These results raise the paradox that recombinant gene expression remains short-term {{even in the absence}} of almost all (~ 99 %) of the HSV- 1 genome, HSV- 1 genes, and HSV- 1 gene expression. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that specific proteins in the HSV- 1 virus particle shut off recombinant gene expression. In two earlier studies, we examined the effects on recombinant gene expression of packaging vectors using specific <b>mutated</b> HSV- 1 <b>proteins.</b> We found that vectors packaged using mutated U L 13 (a protein kinase), or VP 16, or U L 46 and/or U L 47 (components of the VP 16 transcriptional complex) supported improved long-term expression, and vectors packaged using mutated U L 46 and/or U L 47 also supported improved gene transfer (numbers of cells at 4 days). These results suggested the hypothesis that specific proteins in the HSV- 1 particle act by multiple pathways to reduce recombinant gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we examined combinations of <b>mutated</b> <b>proteins</b> that included both U L 13 and specific components of the VP 16 transcriptional complex. Results A HSV- 1 vector containing a neuronal-specific promoter was packaged using specific combinations of <b>mutated</b> <b>proteins,</b> and the resulting vector stocks were tested in the rat striatum. For supporting long-term expression, the preferred combination of <b>mutated</b> HSV- 1 <b>proteins</b> was <b>mutated</b> U L 13, U L 46, and U L 47. Vectors packaged using this combination of <b>mutated</b> <b>proteins</b> supported a higher efficiency of gene transfer and high levels expression for 3 months, the longest time examined. Conclusion Vector particles containing this combination of <b>mutated</b> HSV- 1 <b>proteins</b> improve recombinant gene expression. Implications of these results for strategies to further improve long-term expression are discussed. Moreover, long-term expression will benefit specific gene therapy applications. </p...|$|R
