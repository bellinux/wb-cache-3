Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode [...] "Black Tie" [...] from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator. Forte has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season. Carlock also noted in the Entertainment Weekly interview that the Jenna and Paul characters [...] "have some ups and downs. He wants to try to be a normal couple, and she is afraid of that level of commitment." [...] In the previous episode, [...] "Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish", Jenna and Paul break-up.

[...] She said that on her first day on set she [...] "begged" [...] producers if she could use a teleprompter—in which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)—so that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help [...] "sell" [...] the comedy and her 30 Rock character. They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time.

It first assembles potential influencing factors through literature review, and second, conducts an empirical study by collecting data from finished thirty-two shop-house projects throughout the city. Results of analyses using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicate eight factors to be statistically significant influencing time performance. They are construction design change, schedule of work that will be done, workers discipline, material availability, owner’s payment, quality control, workers availability, and material delivery. The paper discusses the factors and proposes possible solutions to improve time performance...|$|R

6000|$|To feel {{potential}} within one's self {{the capacity}} to live and yet to have no means of realizing this capacity is doubtless {{one of the least}} comfortable and agreeable of human experiences. Such, as summer came on, was Janet's case. The memory of that visit to Silliston lingered in her mind, sometimes to flare up so vividly as to make her existence seem unbearable. How wonderful, she thought, to be able to dwell in such a beautiful place, to have as friends and companions such amusing and intelligent people as the stranger with whom she had talked! Were all the inhabitants of Silliston like him? They must be, since it was a seat of learning. Lise's cry, [...] "I've just got to go away, anywhere," [...] found an echo in Janet's soul. Why shouldn't she go away? She was capable of taking care of herself, she was a good stenographer, her salary had been raised twice in two years,--why should she allow consideration for her family to {{stand in the way of}} what she felt would be self realization? Unconsciously she was a true modern in that the virtues known as duty and self sacrifice did not appeal to her,--she got from them neither benefit nor satisfaction, she understood instinctively that they were impeding to growth. Unlike Lise, she was able to see life as it is, she did not expect of it miracles, economic or matrimonial. Nothing would happen unless she <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen.</b> She was twenty-one, earning nine dollars a week, of which she now contributed five to the household,--her father, with characteristic incompetence, having taken out a larger insurance policy than he could reasonably carry. Of the remaining four dollars she spent more than one on lunches, there were dresses and underclothing, shoes and stockings to buy, in spite of darning and mending; little treats with Eda that mounted up; and occasionally the dentist--for Janet would not neglect her teeth as Lise neglected hers. She managed to save something, but it was very little. And she was desperately unhappy when she contemplated the grey and monotonous vista of the years ahead, saw herself growing older and older, driven always by the stern necessity of accumulating a margin against possible disasters; little by little drying up, losing, by withering disuse, those rich faculties of enjoyment with which she was endowed, and which at once fascinated and frightened her. Marriage, in such an environment, offered no solution; marriage meant dependence, from which her very nature revolted: and in her existence, drab and necessitous though it were, was still a remnant of freedom that marriage would compel her to surrender....|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper {{concerns}} the e-assessment strategy for the valuation and validation of a particular abstract entity: the Virtual Scientific Experiment (VSE) model. This model is included in a particular didactic method, the VSE method (ELeGI D 18), which allows the realisation of an inductive-experiential didactic approach. The choice of a particular method with respect to another method depends both on {{the evaluation of the}} tutor in the context and the information linked to the acquisition of knowledge, competences and skills. The term ‘inductive’ comes from the Latin word epagoge and means the process that moves from specific instances up to a generalisation (Rescher, 1980). The induction refers to the different aspects of e-learning: from a more superficial learning (know-how) to a learning contextualised in time and space (know when and know where), where the mental models are <b>made.</b> <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> when the students take part in a specific activity, make intuitions and conduct analyses. More researches in this line are being carried out to find out how cognitive capability can be supported using the adaptive techniques of assessment to improve the learning process...|$|R

5000|$|Rose further explained, {{that it is}} {{obviously}} desirable in a mechanical drawing to present the piece of work in as few views as possible, but in all cases {{there must be a}} sufficient number to permit of the dimensions in every necessary direction to be marked on the drawing. Suppose, then, that in Figure 120 we have to represent a solid cylinder, whose length equals its diameter, and it is obvious that both the diameter and length may be marked in the one view given; hence, a second view, such as shown by the circle in Figure 121, is unnecessary, except it be to distinguish the body from a cube, in which the 95 one view would also be sufficient whereon to mark all the dimensions necessary to enable the piece to be <b>made.</b> <b>It</b> <b>happens,</b> however, that a cube and a cylinder are the only two figures upon which all the dimensions can be marked on one view of the piece, and as cylindrical pieces are much more common in machine work than cubes are, it is taken for granted that, where the pieces are cylindrical, but one view shall be used, and that where they are cubes either two views shall be given, or where they are square a cross shall be marked upon the parts that are square; thus, in Figure 122, is shown a cross formed by the lines A B across the face of the drawing, which saves making a second view.|$|R
