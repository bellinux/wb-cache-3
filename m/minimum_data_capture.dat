40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{literature}} on the risks and types of injuries associated with visual impairment, and to identify pertinent areas for future research. Methods: A search of bibliographic databases was conducted in April 2000 for studies published since 1980 and selected studies that met two {{or more of the following}} criteria: formal ophthalmic assessment was used; adjustment for confounding variables; large sample size including numbers of visually impaired; and clear definitions and outcomes. Results: Thirty one studies were selected. The majority of these studies (20) assessed falls (including eight on hip fracture and four on multiple falls), eight studies reported traffic related injuries, and three studies assessed occupational injury. The evidence on falls, which relate predominantly to older people, suggests that those with reduced visual acuity are 1. 7 times more likely to have a fall and 1. 9 times more likely to have multiple falls compared with fully sighted populations. The odds of a hip fracture are between 1. 3 and 1. 9 times greater for those with reduced visual acuity. Studies of less severe injuries and other causes of injury were either poorly designed, underpowered, or did not exist. Conclusions: There are substantial gaps in research on both injuries to which people with visual impairment are especially susceptible and in evaluating interventions to reduce these injuries. It is recommended that in future studies the <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> <b>captured</b> includes: formal ophthalmic assessment of visual fields and visual acuity, outcome measurement, control for confounders, and the costs of health care resource use and any interventions. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: this {{research}} examined {{the psychometric properties}} of the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> Set Depression Rating Scale for use among older adults living in nursing homes. METHODS: interviews with 145 older adults in three nursing homes were conducted to complete the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Information relevant to completing the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> Set Depression Rating Scale was gathered from the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> Set. RESULTS:the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> Set Depression Rating Scale did not perform well when validated against the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale. <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> Set Depression Rating Scale cut-off levels of 3 ̆e or = 2 and 3 ̆e or = 3 were associated with relatively low total score correlations and sensitivity rates, but acceptable specificity.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{incorporate}} and to validate the electronic capture of participant-related outcomes into the Oral Survey-B System, which was originally developed for the electronic <b>capture</b> of clinical <b>data.</b> The validation process compared the performances of electronic and handwritten <b>data</b> <b>captures.</b> The hypothesis of noninferiority would be established if participants performed electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> of the questionnaire survey with an effectiveness of at least 95 % of that of handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture.</b> In this multicenter, randomized, one-period crossover study design, participants (n = 261) were allocated to start with either electronic or handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture.</b> The incorporation of the electronic self-completed questionnaire into the Oral Survey-B System was successful. The validation of the electronic questionnaire was performed by participants aged from 18 to 75 years. The interrater reliability of participants performing electronic and handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> of nonclinical assessments per questionnaire and per entry showed a kappa value of 0. 72 (95 % CI: 0. 53 - 0. 94). The noninferiority of electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> in relation to that of the handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> and transfer was shown (p < 0. 0001; 95 % CI: 1. 47 - 2. 99). In conclusion, the electronic capture of participant-related outcomes with the Oral Survey-B System, originally designed for <b>capture</b> of clinical <b>data,</b> was validated. The electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> was accurate and limited the number of errors. The participants were able to perform electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> effectively, supporting its implementation in further National Oral Health Surveys. With the consideration of participant preference and time savings, this could lead to the implementation of electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> worldwide in National Oral Health Surveys.

The validation was undertaken by 52 general practitioners. A randomized one-period crossover design was used with two formats of <b>data</b> <b>capture,</b> i. e. electronic followed by handwritten or handwritten followed by electronic system. Further, 6 benchmarked handwritten forms were transferred to the electronic format. For the electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture,</b> 86. 5 % of the practitioners had a correct completion rate of ≥ 95 %. The corresponding value for the handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> and transfer was 78. 8 % (p = 0. 25, McNemar test). The overall accuracy of forms without any error was 73. 4 % for the electronic and 62. 5 % for the handwritten <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> (p < 0. 001, signed-rank test). Significantly lower percentages of errors and less time were observed for the electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> (p < 0. 001, signed-rank test). Practitioners considered the electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> as being much more difficult to carry out (p < 0. 001). As information technology has turned into an ever more necessary working tool in epidemiology, there should be an important potential for uptake of further improvements in electronic <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> in the future.

40|$|The Sustainable Transport Energy for Perth (STEP) Fuel Cell Bus Trial ran {{for three}} years from October 2004. It was closely {{associated}} with the Clean Urban Transport for Europe (CUTE) trial that operated 33 DaimlerChrysler fuel cell buses in 11 cities around the world. The trial was the subject of an Australian study program that included, amongst other analysis areas, an operational analysis and an economic analysis. The scope of this research covered these two research topics and was structured to answer the following questions: 1. What is the <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> required to successfully evaluate the technical and cost-benefit performance of a new bus technology, compared to the incumbent technology? 2. How did the assessment of the Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial lead to the development of this methodology? 3. What lessons were learnt from the application of this methodology to the Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial? 4. How applicable has this approach been to subsequent bus trials? The operational analysis drew on daily reporting on the operation of the EcoBuses. Data was stored and analysed using a database developed for this research. The final database contained 101, 736 separate entries in 14 tables. The economic analysis examined a base case and six scenarios to examine variations in the base case parameters. The method and economic model have been validated in several bus trials since the completion of the Perth fuel cell bus trial. The key results of this study were: • A description of the <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> required to <b>capture</b> both the performance and operating conditions for a bus trial was developed. The key components were: - financial performance in terms of capital and operating costs and - environmental performance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and air toxic emissions during production and operation and the social costs of those emissions. • Bus performance, both financial and environmental, is highly dependent on operating conditions. It is critical that the operating conditions are captured to give context to the buses performance. These include passenger loads, terrain, operating distance, traffic conditions, and weather conditions. • In the three year Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial, the EcoBuses travelled a total of 258, 000 km and consumed an average of 18. 1 kg of hydrogen per 100 km...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{systematic}} {{capture of}} appropriately annotated experimental data {{is a prerequisite}} for most bioinformatics analyses. <b>Data</b> <b>capture</b> is required not only for submission of data to public repositories, but also to underpin integrated analysis, archiving, and sharing – both within laboratories and in collaborative projects. The widespread requirement to <b>capture</b> <b>data</b> means that <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> and annotation are taking place at many sites, but the small scale of the literature on tools, techniques and experiences suggests that there is work to be done to identify good practice and reduce duplication of effort. Results This paper reports on experience gained in the deployment of the Pedro <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> tool in a range of representative bioinformatics applications. The paper makes explicit the requirements that have recurred when <b>capturing</b> <b>data</b> in different contexts, indicates how these requirements are addressed in Pedro, and describes case studies that illustrate where the requirements have arisen in practice. Conclusion <b>Data</b> <b>capture</b> is a fundamental activity for bioinformatics; all biological data resources build on some form of <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> activity, and many require a blend of import, analysis and annotation. Recurring requirements in <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> suggest that model-driven architectures can be used to construct <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> infrastructures that can be rapidly configured {{to meet the needs of}} individual use cases. We have described how one such model-driven infrastructure, namely Pedro, has been deployed in representative case studies, and discussed the extent to which the model-driven approach has been effective in practice. </p...|$|R
