5000|$|On 24 January Walid Nabhan, a Palestinian refugee (now <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizen)</b> {{has stated}} that the prayers being {{organized}} by the Malta Muslim Council (led by Bader Zeina) are a form of Islamic fundamentalism. He said that the building of another mosque is unnecessarily and that this would officiate the [...] "split" [...] between the Muslim community of the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque and the Muslim community of the Malta Muslim Council. He also discredited the need of other Muslim places of worship. He further observed that Bader Zeina himself, on Times Talk television program (on TVM (Malta)), has {{gone as far as}} silencing a Maltese woman (who converted to Islam) namely Simone Zammit Endrich who spoke of Islamic facts (religious practice and norms) rather than political Islam. Walid Nabham is an integral well established writer (author and poet) in Malta and has written several literature material, including books about Islam and Arab culture, and has taken stands several times against religious fundamentalism. Following Nabham's remarks both him and Mr Zeina were invited on Disett, a talkshow on TVM; were Zeina did not turn up, and when Nabham went back to his car after the talkshow he found his car vandalized which was interpreted as a form of a threat or warning.|$|E
40|$|One aim of schooling, as {{the role}} of the nation-state, is the {{creation}} of the citizen (Dewey, 2006). However, no citizen can be created without the creation of the ‘other’ (Ahmad, 2009; Sultana, 2008; Mason, 2007). In this essay I ask ‘who is the <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizen,</b> as the selected ambassador of the culture that propels this society, and who are his/her ‘others’?’ I seek to answer these questions by looking at the state’s syllabi and books used in Social Studies in Maltese primary schools and argue how Maltese are given a monolithic identity marked by them being Christian and European. This process is inevitably violent upon the ‘other’ who lives with (or amongst) the Maltese in a context where Huntington’s (1993) “doomsday image” (Brasted, 1997, p. 8) is becoming increasingly relevant. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A lot {{of water}} has flowed under the bridge since, in their {{anticipation}} of a Turkish invasion, the Order of St. John perceived the eldest island inhabitants as ‘useless civilians’ and evacuated them to Sicily. Malta nowadays holds a key place {{in the history of}} international ageing policy. The Maltese Government made Malta the first nation to raise the subject of population ageing as an issue of world concern. This occurred in 1969 when it successfully appealed to the United Nations for the theme’s inclusion on the agenda of the 24 th session of the General Assembly. This led to unprecedented awareness on the effects of population ageing. The United Nations eventually organised a World Assembly on Ageing in 1982 where, to Malta’s credit, the designated chairperson was a <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizen.</b> However, as Brincat recently highlighted, the history of the modern Maltese welfare state awaits detailed study. This is especially true with respect to policies relating to later life. Historical analyses of the development of social policies in Malta tend to focus on general health, educational, and labour issues, and hardly any attention is awarded towards the foundation of those services geared towards older persons. Given the space limitations, and specific focus of this publication, this paper does not seek to address such a lacuna. Rather, its goal is to conduct a critical overview as how the development of local ageing policy was stimulated and influenced by the values and judgements of the Labour Party in Malta...|$|E
40|$|Ad Patriam (O Melita Infelix) was {{discovered}} by coincidence in a volume of the Magna Curia Castellania - the Grand Master's courts. In the second volume of a section entitled "Cedulae, Suplicae et Taxationes" for the years 1565 - 66, I came across this poem signed by "Lucas de Armenia – Patricius Melivetanus". Ad Patriam {{is to be found}} on the recto of the last folio. The poem consists of twelve lines and is written in simple Latin verse based on the distribution of long and short syllables. It has rhythm which could be heard when read aloud. Other indications of its rhythm are the scribblings found all over the sheet of paper but notably the signs above the first verse and beside every couple of verses. Underneath the poem one finds a dedication which reads: "AI molto mag. signor mio da fratello honorando". The signature is however illegible {{and it is difficult to}} deduce to whom it was really dedicated. One could also note various other attempts at composition. The handwriting of Luca de Armenia is legible and is typical of that of the second half of the sixteenth century, when it, in fact, was written. The formal title of the poem is "Ad Patriam", but de Armenia himself seems to prefer to call it "O Melita Infelix" which constitutes the introductory phrase of the poem. Furthermore this same phrase is found twice again at the end of the poem. The signature shows that de Armenia considered himself to be not only a Patrician but also a <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizen.</b> Details of his life are given in this article. peer-reviewe...|$|E

5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizens</b> {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizens.</b> The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although <b>Maltese</b> <b>citizens</b> had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|R
