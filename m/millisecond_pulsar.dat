5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986—a <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsar</b> in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E
5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsar.</b> In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> to their short periods. However, <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there has}} been recent {{evidence}} that the standard evolutionary model fails to explain the evolution of all <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars,</b> especially young <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> with relatively high magnetic fields, e.g. PSR B1937+21.

It is currently believed to have originally been the planet of WD B1620-26 before becoming a circumbinary planet, and therefore, while discovered through the pulsar timing method, it did not form the way that PSR B1257+12's planets are thought to have.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of millisecond pulsations from neutron stars in low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems has substantiated the theoretical prediction that links <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> (MSRPs) and LMXBs. Since then, {{the process that}} produces <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> from LMXBs, followed by spin-down due to dipole radiation has been conceived as the 'standard evolution' of <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars.</b> However, the question whether all the observed <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> could be produced by LMXBs has not been quantitatively addressed until now. The standard evolutionary process produces <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> with periods (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that are not entirely independent. The possible P-Pdot values that <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> can attain are jointly constrained. In order to test whether the observed <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> are the unequivocal descendants of <b>millisecond</b> X-ray <b>pulsars</b> (MSXP), we have produced a probability map that represents the expected distribution of <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> for the standard model.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{launch of}} several {{sensitive}} X-ray and γ-ray instruments {{during the last}} decade heralded a new era in the research of <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars.</b> The current number of <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> detected in the X-ray spectral window is about 30, including those located in globular clusters, which represents a significant fraction {{of the total number of}} spin-down powered pulsars emitting high-energy radiation. In this paper the observational X/γ-ray status is reported for a subset of X-ray emitting <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> which show high-energy tails: PSR B 1821 - 24, PSR J 0218 + 4232 and PSR B 1937 + 21.

40|$|Abstract <b>Millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> {{represent}} an evolutionarily distinct group among rotation-powered pulsars. Outside the radio band, the soft X-ray range (∼ 0. 1 – 10 keV) is {{most suitable for}} studying radiative mechanisms operating in these fascinating objects. X-ray observations revealed diverse properties of emission from <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars.</b> For the most of them, the bulk of radiation is of a thermal origin, emitted from small spots (polar caps) on the neutron star surface heated by relativistic particles produced in pulsar acceleration zones. On the other hand, a few other very fast rotating pulsars exhibit almost pure nonthermal emission generated, most probably, in pulsar magnetospheres. There are also examples of nonthermal emission detected from X-ray nebulae powered by <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars,</b> {{as well as from}} pulsar winds shocked in binary systems with <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> as companions.

25|$|PSR B1257+12 was {{discovered}} by the Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan on 9 February 1990 using the Arecibo radio telescope. It is a <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsar,</b> a kind of neutron star, with a rotation period of 6.22 milliseconds (9,650rpm), and {{was found to have}} anomalies in the pulsation period, which led to investigations as to the cause of the irregular pulses.

25|$|In 1967, {{the first}} pulsar, PSR B1919+21, was {{discovered}} in Vulpecula by Jocelyn Bell, supervised by Antony Hewish, in Cambridge. While they were searching for scintillation of radio signals of quasars, they observed pulses which repeated with a period of 1.3373 seconds. Terrestrial origin of the signal was ruled out because {{the time it took}} the object to reappear was a sidereal day instead of a solar day. This anomaly was finally identified as the signal of a rapidly rotating neutron star. Fifteen years after the first pulsar was discovered, the first <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsar,</b> PSR B1937+21, was also discovered in Vulpecula, only a few degrees in the sky away from PSR B1919+21.|$|E

On April 7, 1964, soon after it began operating, Gordon Pettengill's team used it to determine that the rotation period of Mercury was not 88 days, as formerly thought, but only 59 days. In 1968, {{the discovery of the}} periodicity of the Crab Pulsar (33 milliseconds) by Lovelace and others provided the first solid evidence that neutron stars exist. In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered the first binary pulsar PSR B1913+16, an accomplishment for which they later received the Nobel Prize in Physics.

40|$|Rotation-powered <b>millisecond</b> radio <b>pulsars</b> {{have been}} spun {{up to their}} present spin period by a $ 10 ^ 8 $ - $ 10 ^ 9 $ yr long X-ray-bright phase of {{accretion}} of matter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system. Recently, the discovery of transitional pulsars that alternate cyclically between accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales {{of a few years}} or shorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. Here, we present a thorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes of <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> to assess the evolution of their spin period between the different stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during thermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars)</b> are found to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting sources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars)</b> are not. On the other hand, if accreting <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> and eclipsing rotation-powered <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> form a common class of transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution intermediate between the faster nuclear-powered <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars</b> and the slower non-eclipsing rotation-powered <b>millisecond</b> <b>pulsars.</b> We interpret these findings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate during the latest stages of the accretion phase, {{and in terms of the}} different orbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars.
