5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of <b>medium</b> <b>frequency,</b> in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

25|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>{{frequency}}</b> (MF) {{and lower}} high frequency (HF) radio waves are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, {{giving up their}} energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This {{is the main reason}} for absorption of HF radio waves, particularly at 10nbsp&MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to cosmic rays. A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM broadcast band stations in the daytime.|$|E
40|$|Artículos en revistasAn {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} the hysteresis cycle of magnetic cores is a crucial step in its characterization due to the importance that its nonlinear and past-dependent effects can have on the correct operation in most electric and electronic circuits. The measurements of asymmetric minor loops, in conditions where Foucault currents can be neglected, can be useful to train models. Performing such measurements only at very low frequencies is not a solution, given the need to identify dynamic parameters of the aforementioned models. In a previous paper, the authors proposed a method for measuring major loops of hysteresis cycles up to <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies,</b> given the limitation of the classic method when increasing frequency. The method, which has been improved in this paper, is tested by measuring nonsymmetric loops of the hysteresis cycle at <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Simulated and experimental results are provided. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{extent to}} which {{so-called}} low-level features are relevant to predict gaze allocation has been widely studied recently. However, the conclusions are contradictory. Edges and luminance contrasts seem to be always involved, but literature is conflicting about contribution of the different spatial scales. It appears that experiments using an-made scenes lead {{to the conclusion that}} fixation location can be efficiently discriminated using high-frequency information, whereas mid- or low frequencies are more discriminative for natural scenes. This paper focuses on the importance of spatial scale to predict visual attention. We propose a fast attentional model and study which frequency band predicts the best fixation locations during free-viewing task. An eye-tracking experiment has been conducted using different scene categories defined by their Fourier spectrums (Coast, Open-Country, Mountain, and Street). We found that <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies</b> (0. 7 - 1. 3 cycles per degree) globally allowed the best prediction of attention, with variability among categories.

To simplify the exposition we shall only consider Hamiltonians {{of the form}} H := - 1 / 2 Δ_M, where Δ_M is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold M which is a smooth compact perturbation of three-dimensional Euclidean space ^ 3 which obeys the non-trapping condition. We establish a global-in-time local smoothing estimate for the Schrödinger equation u_t = -iHu. The main novelty here is the global-in-time aspect of the estimates, which forces a more detailed analysis on the low and <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the evolution than in the local-in-time theory. In particular, to handle the <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies</b> we require the RAGE theorem (which {{reflects the fact that}} H has no embedded eigenvalues), together with a quantitative version of Enss' method decomposing the solution asymptotically into incoming and outgoing components, while to handle the low frequencies we need a Poincare-type inequality (which reflects the fact that H has no eigenfunctions or resonances at zero).

This hypothesis is still under debate. We tested it under conditions of binocular rivalry (BR), where a monkey perceived alternations among conflicting gratings presented singly to each eye at orthogonal orientations. We made multi-channel microelectrode recordings of multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from striate cortex (V 1) during BR while the monkey indicated his perception by pushing a lever. We analyzed spectral power and coherence of MUA and LFP over 4 – 90 Hz. As in previous work, coherence of γ-signals in most pairs of recording locations strongly depended on grating orientation when stimuli were presented congruently in both eyes. With incongruent (rivalrous) stimulation LFP power was often consistently modulated in consonance with the perceptual state. This was not visible in MUA. These perception-related modulations of LFP occurred at low and <b>medium</b> <b>frequencies</b> (< 30 Hz), but not at γ-frequencies.
