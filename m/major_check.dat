50|$|During {{the early}} eighth century the Arabs {{appeared}} in the region from the Mediterranean coast of Spain, capturing Narbonne from the last Visigoths in 719. Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, wali (governor) of al-Andalus (Muslim Spain), mustered a strong army from North Africa, Syria and Yemen to conquer Aquitaine. Moving west from Narbonne, he besieged Toulouse. After three months, as the city was about to surrender, Duke Odo of Aquitaine (also known as Eudes)—who had left the city to find help—returned with an army and defeated the Arabs in the Battle of Toulouse on June 9, 721. Charles Martel refused to help, wishing {{to take advantage of}} the situation to recover Aquitaine, and Odo led an army of Aquitanians and Franks to fight the Arabs. The Battle of Toulouse was a crushing defeat for the Arabs; the army scattered, most of the soldiers were killed, al-Samh died of his wounds and the remainder of the Arab troops (under Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi) fled back to Narbonne. It is noted by Arab historians as the <b>major</b> <b>check</b> of Arab westward expansion.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{so-called}} split utterances as {{our point}} of departure, we argue that {{a new perspective on}} the major challenge of disambiguation becomes available, given a framework in which both parsing and generation incrementally involve the same mechanisms for constructing trees reflecting interpretation (Dynamic Syntax: (Cann et al., 2005; Kempson et al., 2001)). With all dependencies, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic, defined in terms of incremental progressive tree growth, the phenomenon of speaker/hearer role-switch emerges as an immediate consequence, with the potential for clarification, acknowledgement, correction, all available incrementally at any sub-sentential point in the interpretation process. Accordingly, at all intermediate points where interpretation of an utterance subpart is not fully determined for the hearer in context, uncertainty can be resolved immediately by suitable clarification/correction/repair/extension as an exchange between interlocutors. The result is a <b>major</b> <b>check</b> on the combinatorial explosion of alternative structures and interpretations at each choice point, and the basis for a model of how interpretation in context can be established without either party having to make assumptions about what information they and their interlocutor share in resolving ambiguities. ...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty radiata pine boards were dried using {{different}} methods (air drying, commercial kiln drying and laboratory kiln drying) to study the effect of knot, wood and seasoning variables {{on the nature of}} knot checking. Among the knot variables, the largest knot group (diameter> 75 mm) was found associated with the highest check rate and the most severe checks. Medium size group (25 mm < diameter ≤ 75 mm) had significantly lower check rate. Face knots were significantly more liable to cracking than any type else. The <b>major</b> <b>check</b> directions of a knot generally ran across the symmetrical axes of the knot. In wood variables, due to lower number of medium size knots butt half had higher check rate than upper part of stem. After studying the density and check ratio of northern outer wood, southern outer wood and core wood, a reverse relation was found between the density and the check ratio. Final moisture content affected knot checking directly because it is proportional to shrinkage. Temperature did not show significant influence. Air dried timbers, especially those exposed to air without shield, had more severe checks than those exposed to other drying conditions. There were no relationships found among sawn pattern, dimensions of boards and check rate of knots...|$|E

Tryptic digestion a <b>major</b> <b>check</b> point in sample preparation for mass spectrometry based proteomics needs to be more accurate with rapid processing time. The present study focuses on establishing a high throughput automated online system for proteolytic digestion and desalting of proteins from biological samples quantitatively and qualitatively in a reproducible manner.

Proteins were identified using SEQUEST data base search engine and the data were quantified using IDEALQ software. The present study shows that the online system capable of handling high throughput samples in 96 well formats carries out protein digestion and peptide desalting efficiently in a reproducible and quantitative manner. Label free quantification showed clear increase of peptide quantities with increase in concentration with much linearity compared to off line method. Hence we would like to suggest that inclusion of this online system in proteomic pipeline will be effective in quantification of proteins in comparative proteomics were the quantification is really very crucial...|$|E
40|$|Cyclins {{are prime}} cell cycle {{regulators}} and {{are central to}} the control of <b>major</b> <b>check</b> points in eukaryotic cells. The aberrant expressions of two cyclins (i. e., cyclins A and D 1) have been observed in some cancers, suggesting they may be involved in loss of growth control. However, in spite of these occasional changes involving only two cyclins, there are no clear connections between general derangements of other cyclins or their dependent kinases in a single tumor type. We detected general cyclin overexpression in 3 of 3 breast tumor tissue samples. In addition, using proliferating normal vs. human tumor breast cells as a model system, we observed a number of alterations in cyclin expression: (i) an 8 -fold amplification of cyclin E gene in one tumor line, a 64 -fold overexpression of its mRNA, and altered expression of its protein; (ii) deranged expression of cyclin E protein in all (10 of 10) tumor cell lines studied; (iii) increased cyclin mRNA stability, resulting in (iv) general overexpression of RNAs and proteins for cyclins A and B and CDC 2 in 9 of 10 tumor lines and (v) deranged order of appearance of cyclins in synchronized tumor vs. normal cells, with mitotic cyclins appearing prior to G 1 cyclins. These multiple general derangements in cyclin expression in human breast cancer cells provide evidence linking aberrant cyclin expression to tumorigenesis...|$|E

40|$|This article first {{reviews the}} basic physics of {{rotating}} stars and their evolution. We examine {{in particular the}} changes of the mechanical and thermal equilibrium of rotating stars. An important (predicted and observed) effect is that rotating stars are hotter at the poles and cooler at the equator. We briefly discuss the mass loss by stellar winds, which {{are influenced by the}} anisotropic temperature distribution. These anisotropies in the interior are also driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements and the angular momentum in stars. Internal differential rotation, if present, creates instabilities and mixing, in particular the shear mixing, the horizontal turbulence and their interactions. A <b>major</b> <b>check</b> of the model predictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modified by mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in O- and B-type stars. We show that the observations confirm the existence of rotational mixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities. We discuss the predictions of stellar models concerning the evolution of the surface velocities, the evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram and lifetimes, the populations of blue, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, and the progenitors of type Ibc supernovae. We show, that in many aspects, rotating models provide a much better fit than non-rotating ones. Using the same physical ingredients as those which fit the best the observations of stars at near solar metallicities, we explore the consequences of rotating models for the status of Be stars, the progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursts, the evolution of Pop III stars and of very metal poor stars, the early chemical evolution of galaxies, the origin of the C-enhanced Metal Poor stars (CEMP) and of the chemical anomalies in globular clusters.

40|$|When wood is {{densified}} through semi-isostatical compression in a Quintus- press at pressures up to 140 MPa, {{the material}} properties change. The cells are flattened, size is decreased and shape is changed, {{as a consequence}} of this the density is increased. Most properties of native woods are strongly correlated to the density. This is also true for densified wood. To understand the compression mechanisms plastic and elastic strains were studied at different pressures. Strength, density, anatomy and swelling were studied. Some of the methods used were: image analysis, computer tomography scanning (CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing. Data was statistically analysed by linear regression and multivariate statistical methods. A big advantage of using semi-isostatic pressure is that wood of all dimensions, with knots and anomalous wood can be compressed without <b>major</b> <b>checking.</b> As the pressure is mediated through a flexible diaphragm the density becomes homogenous. Plain-sawn wood with inside-face to press-table gets the most homogenous density and the most rectangular shape. Strength is improved by the densification, especially the hardness, the bending and the axial compression strength. At water-soaking densified wood, the cell-shape recovers almost completely. This indicates the non-destructive character of the process. The swelling pressure, that develops when densified wood is restrained from dimensional change and then water-soaked, is more than twice as high as for native wood. The swelling can be reduced by deep impregnation with oil in combination with a surface lacquer. Godkänd; 2006; 20061130 (pafi...|$|R
