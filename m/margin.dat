Materials and Methods: Records of 306 cases were reviewed for clinical details and status of <b>margins</b> at resection. The independent influence of <b>margins</b> on recurrence was analyzed. The impact of frozen section analysis on achieving free <b>margins</b> was also examined. Results: 190 (62. 1 %) patients had negative <b>margins</b> of resection (≥ 5 mm), 102 (33. 3 %) patients had close <b>margins</b> (1 - 5 mm), while 14 (4. 6 %) patients had positive <b>margins</b> (≤ 1 mm). The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 26. 5 months. There were 79 (25. 8 %) recurrences, of which, 46 (58. 2 %) were local, 9 (11. 3 %) were locoregional, 16 (20. 2 %) were regional, and 8 (10. 1 %) were distant metastasis. 42 (22. 2 %) cases with negative <b>margins</b> developed a recurrence as compared to 31 (30. 4 %) cases with close <b>margins</b> and 6 (42. 8 %) cases with positive <b>margins</b> (P value 0. 01). Average time to recurrence in case of negative <b>margins</b> was 34. 8 months, for close <b>margins</b> was 33. 9 months, while in those with positive <b>margins</b> was 10. 18 months (P value 0. 002).

METHODS The <b>margins</b> of 10 lesions were evaluated using RCM. Biopsies of the <b>margins</b> were used to confirm the results. A protocol was constructed to define <b>margins.</b> RCM was used to delineate preoperative surgical <b>margins</b> in 13 patients. Intraoperative frozen biopsy was used to confirm the <b>margins.</b> RESULTS In seven of 10 (70. 0 %) cases, the <b>margins</b> of the cancer were identified suing RCM. The tumor island was the critical feature in identifying the <b>margins.</b> In 12 of 13 (92. 3 %) cases, frozen biopsy corroborated that the surgical <b>margins</b> delineated by RCM were clear.
