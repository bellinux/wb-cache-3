40|$|The Chicago School {{view that}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{unlikely}} to be profitable has influenced competition case law around the world. In the context of predatory pricing, for example, the US Supreme Court stated, in the famous Matsushita case, 1 that ‘there is a consensus among commentators that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful’. Since then economics and legal scholars have analysed the rationale for <b>exclusionary</b> <b>behaviour</b> in market settings in which information is imperfect and reputations and long-term effects matter. In this article we systematically survey these new developments and argue that these more complex models of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>behaviour</b> do not yield simple tests. Therefore, in litigation, it is likely that these theories and associated tests will be seen as one, of several, pieces of a jigsaw and that a great deal of judicial scepticism about the rationale for <b>exclusionary</b> <b>behaviour,</b> perhaps justifiably so, will remain...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the EC {{competition and}} US antitrust approaches to tying with special reference to economic thinking and intellectual property rights. It establishes that {{from an economic}} perspective that tying cannot be considered purely anticompetitive. Only when certain conditions are present is this the case: <b>market</b> <b>power,</b> an imperfect tied product market, which includes insufficient competition, high barriers to entry, and competitors' inability {{to compete with the}} dominant company's tied product package. Even in these circumstances, tying may have pro-competitive effects, which can outweigh the anti-competitive effects. While in the EC, competition law has completely overtaken the dealings with tying, in the US the Patent Act has adopted a per se legality approach only condemning tying when the intellectual property owner holds <b>market</b> <b>power</b> and applies the tying alTangement together with the patent to extend his patent monopoly to staple products. In comparison, competition law {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic see tying as (almost) illegal per se - almost because both jurisdictions require establishment of <b>market</b> <b>power.</b> A similar four-step test has. been applied in both the EC and the US: 1) <b>market</b> <b>power</b> in the tying product market 2) two separate products 3) anti-competitive effects on the tied product market 4) no objective justifications By assessing these steps in detail, the thesis identifies that when dealing with more complex products, technologically integrated products and products protected by intellectual property rights, the four-step test is inadequate and will often result in a wrong conclusion. The thesis therefore proposes a new test, which takes into consideration economic thinking, the recent reform debate of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which has proposed a more economic approach to <b>exclusionary</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the fact that intellectual property rights do not always confer <b>market</b> <b>power</b> and also attempts to create greater legal certainty to ensure that despite having <b>market</b> <b>power</b> a company can tie when the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects.

40|$|Latin American {{countries}} {{have not had}} much experience with competition policies in the past. Combined with restrictive trade policies, the absence of competition policies has often led to monopolized domestic markets. The strong trade liberalizations in Latin America during the 1980 s and the 1990 s have introduced a good measure of import competition, but trade policies alone are not sufficient to create a competitive environment in an economy. The presence of non-traded goods, vertical integration, monopolized distribution systems, the limited use of trade policies to foster competition, and sometimes the use of anti-dumping measures, countervailing duties, and safeguards as protective devices have constrained the effectiveness of trade policy {{as an instrument of}} competition policy. Competition policies, such as anti-trust, merger controls, and other regulatory means, can prevent the abuse of <b>market</b> <b>power,</b> dominance, <b>exclusionary</b> practices, and collusion among competitors. Domestic competition is further enhanced by foreign ownership and liberalized investment regimes. These latter provisions provide a market presence that enhances competition. This paper holds that trade and competition policies are essential complements and when they are used together they can lead to higher levels of welfare. There are of course tensions between these two policies that arise from globalization, regional policies, technical barriers, certain forms of industrial policies, and macroeconomic exigencies. Trade policy itself can be used for protection even without high tariffs or quantitative restrictions through anti- dumping measures, countervailing duties, and safeguard measures, that would limit, rather than promote, competition. Caution should be the guiding principle in the use of these measures and they should be GATT compatible in law, and competition promoting in spirit. The authors favor the use of safeguards, rather than other trade measures, to provide temporary protection to firms facing import surges. While Latin American {{countries have}} recently made impressive progress in trade reforms, there has been limited use of competition policies. The paper argues for the use of competition policies to enhance the gains made through trade reforms and for the harmonization of competition policies as these countries reduce trade barriers against each other through regional agreements. More effort should be made to create favorable competitive environments, harmonize trade, regulation, competition policies and conflict resolution, strengthen their enforcement mechanisms, and make...|$|R

The presence of <b>market</b> <b>power</b> can change the dispatch order of generators, pressure to over-build transmission networks in order to relieve load pockets in a market. Perhaps most importantly, the exercise of <b>market</b> <b>power</b> results in power price rises and substantial wealth transfers between electricity customers and generators. For these reasons, electricity market regulators around the world tend to be interested in mechanisms for predicting marker power ex ante and detecting and controlling the exercise of <b>market</b> <b>power</b> ex post.

Some of these questions quite naturally focus on the precise degree of importance given to <b>market</b> <b>power.</b> Is it an essential ingredient in antitrust cases, or merely one of several factors to be taken into account? And does the answer to those questions depend on the kind of case we are considering? Other questions involve how one determines whether <b>market</b> <b>power</b> exists in a particular situation.

We use annual data from the cigarette manufacturing industry from 1977 to 1993.
