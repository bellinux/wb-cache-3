The chamber was constructed from Plexiglass, has a volume of 75 ft 3, operated at a flowrate of 33. 8 CFM, and both the <b>makeup</b> and exhaust <b>air</b> are HEPA filtered. Fly ash dust was generated using a Wright Dust Feeder. An elutriator was used to eliminate particles larger 8 μm aerodynamic diameter from the airstream. A direct reading instrument, the Rupprecht and Patashnick PM- 10 TEOM, was used for determination of particle concentration. Particle size distributions were determined by a QCM cascade impactor. Data from gravimetric analysis were used to test for the evenness of dust concentrations in the chamber. CO 2 is used as a representative gas and its concentration was measured using the Metrosonics aq- 5000. Total dust concentrations as measured by the TEOM, in μg/m 3, at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 6 RPMs of the Wright Dust Feeder, were 110 + 2. 8, 173 + 8. 5, 398 + 20 and 550 + 17, respectively. For these RPMs, particle size distributions were associated with a MMD of 1. 27 μm and a GSD of 2. 35, a MMD of 1. 39 and a GSD of 2. 22, a MMD of 1. 46 and a GSD of 2. 08, a MMD of 1. 15 and a GSD of 2. 2, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: The {{flow and}} leakage {{characteristics}} of the air-curtain fume hood under high temperature operation (between 100 °C and 250 °C) were studied. Laser-assisted flow visualization technique was used to reveal the hot plume movements in the cabinet and the critical conditions for the hoodtop leakage. The sulfur hexafluoride tracer-gas concentration test method {{was employed to examine}} the containment spillages from the sash opening and the hood top. It was found that the primary parameters dominating the behavior of the flow field and hood performance are the sash height and the suction velocity as an air-curtain hood is operated at high temperatures. At large sash height and low suction velocity, the air curtain broke down and accompanied with three-dimensional flow in the cabinet. Since the suction velocity was low and the sash opening was large, the <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> drawn down from the hood top became insufficient to counter act the rising hot plume. Under this situation, containment leakage from the sash opening and the hood top was observed. At small sash opening and high suction velocity, the air curtain presented robust characteristics and the <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> flow from the hood top was sufficiently large. Therefore the containment leakages from the sash opening and the hood top were not observed.

Mechanical smoke extraction systems are commonly installed in larger buildings. In designing such a system, <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> must be provided to displace the hot smoke.

In this paper, the efficiency of mechanical exhaust in an atrium with different arrangements for air supply will be discussed. Full-scale burning tests on smoke filling and mechanical extraction were conducted in a full-scale burning facility, the PolyU/USTC atrium, with inner dimensions of 22. 4 m × 11. 9 m × 27. 0 m, as a collaborative project between The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Numerical simulations with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package - the fire dynamics simulator (FDS) developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology - were also carried out. The predicted results agreed with experimental measurement from the full-scale burning tests.

40|$|Providing {{ventilation}} for acceptable {{indoor air}} quality per ASHRAE Standard 62 - 1989 does not require large increases in utility costs. Building efficiency {{does not have to}} be sacrificed for a healthy building. The ASHRAE 62 - 1989 requirement for office ventilation is 20 cubic feet of fresh air per occupant. However, the Standard also allows various controls strategies to achieve the same result. This paper will describe the methods and application of several of these options. However. due to length restrictions, systems design criteria and comparisons will not be addressed. The simplest and most commonly used method is reducing the fresh airflow based on building occupancy, or demand control ventilation. This is currently done with carbon dioxide sensors controlling inlet dampers or fan control systems. As the people load varies causing changes in carbon dioxide level, the controls can vary the amount of ventilation air entering the building. A second method is removing the contaminants with added or special filtration. This allows more air to be recirculated but has specific limitations. Filters can remove large particulates and some chemical contaminants by changing the filter media. However, a minimum amount of fresh air, approximately 20 % to 30 %of the full 20 cfm per person. is still required to remove the carbon dioxide and other contaminants not removed by the filters. Another group of methods is energy recovery systems including; sensible heat wheels, desiccant heat wheels, heat pipes, and run around loops. These methods can be used on some packaged equipment but is normally provided on <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> units and central air supply systems.

Energy and mass balance equations were used to simulate the indoor air quality (IAQ) and operational cost for a variety of ventilation conditions over a 3 -month winter period for a facility located in the Midwest U. S., using simplified and real-time production parameters, comparing results to field data. A revised model was improved by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) between modeled and measured NH 3 and CO 2. After optimizing NH 3 and CO 2, other IAQ results from the simulation were compared to field measurements using linear regression. For NH 3, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) for simulation results and field measurements improved from 0. 02 with the original model to 0. 37 with the new model. For CO 2, the R(2) for simulation results and field measurements was 0. 49 with the new model.

Operation of the air cleaner decreased inhalable dust by 35 % and respirable dust concentrations by 33 %, while having no effect on NH 3, CO 2, in agreement with field data, and increasing operational cost by $ 860 (58 %) for the three-month period.

Prior studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of enclosed cabs have shown that these floor heaters can generate notable amounts of dust within the cab enclosure. Multiple-shift dust levels measured inside a drill cab increased on average 0. 04 mg/m 3 during the summer months to 0. 68 mg/m 3 during the winter months. Additional dust level measurements, made with optical particle counters during a nondrilling time period, verified that dust levels inside the cab increased from 0. 03 to 0. 26 mg/m 3 when the floor heater/fan was turned on. Dust levels within the cab also became greater than the ambient air dust levels outside of the cab when the floor heater was turned on during the nondrilling time period. This shows that the floor heater was a notable dust source problem. Cab floors are commonly soiled from operators tracking dirt inside the cab upon entering from the mine or construction site. Interior cab dust levels can be increased by (1) airflow disturbance of the soiled floor or (2) operator disturbance of the soiled floor. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 2000098...|$|E
40|$|Constant speed fan single stack {{exhaust systems}} {{are widely used}} in {{laboratory}} buildings. <b>Makeup</b> <b>air</b> is always introduced at the inlet of the exhaust fan to maintain constant fan airflow and stack exit velocity when building exhaust airflow changes. The exhaust systems have either more negative duct static pressure or high fan airflow under partial loads. As a result, the exhaust systems have high energy consumption and considerable noise problems. ^ Several measures were developed to improve system performance. The damper measure adds a modulating damper in the main duct to reduce excessive fan head and maintain a constant duct static pressure. The VFD measure adds a variable frequency drive (VFD) on the exhaust fan to balance the fan head with the reduced system pressure drop and maintain a constant duct static pressure. The multiple-stack measure uses multiple stacks, {{in lieu of a}} single stack, to reduce the fan airflow with a constant stack exit velocity. Overall, a system with both VFD and multi-stack measures can achieve the best system performance. ^ In multi-stack and VFD exhaust systems, annual fan electricity consumption is affected by the system pressure drop distribution, the building exhaust airflow time pattern and the multiple stack capacities. In order to achieve the best system performance, optimization methods for the stack design were developed for the new system design and the existing system retrofit, respectively. ^ Finally, a demonstration project was conducted on a laboratory exhaust system. A double-stack assembly was installed atop the single stack and a VFD was installed on the exhaust fan. The measurements show that all critical parameters were controlled. The stack exit velocity maintains a safe level when the building airflow changes. The fan peak demand reduction is 49 % and the fan energy savings is 55 % compared to the original system.

To achieve the IAQ goal, the building utilizes a series of air cleaning technologies for treating the air entering the building. These technologies include an initial water wash followed by ultraviolet light treatment and biolfiltration using a greenhouse located on the roof and numerous plants distributed throughout the building. Even with the extensive treatment of <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> and room air in the PBC, a recent study found that the concentrations of common volatile organic compounds and aldehydes appear to rise incrementally as the air passes through the building from the supply to the exhaust. This finding highlights the need to consider the minimization of chemical sources in buildings in combination with the use of advanced air cleaning technologies when seeking to achieve superior IAQ.

The materials were pre-conditioned for two different time periods before measuring material and chemical specific emission factors for a range of VOCs and Aldehydes. Of the six materials tested, we found that the highest emitter of formaldehyde was new plywood paneling.

A number of technologies have been developed {{with the aim of}} reducing the demand associated with the maintenance of acceptable levels of indoor air quality and comfort in residential buildings. Two such technologies were studied here. The unglazed transpired solar collector (UTSC) represents a radical shift from earlier collector designs with its perforated metal cladding and the absence of glazings and covers. It acts as a ventilation air preheater by delivering warmed air to a conventional <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> heater which supplies any necessary supplemental heating prior to building delivery. The perforated design allows the boundary layer to be sucked into the collector, resulting in very high thermal efficiencies. A model consisting of a UTSC system and the building on which it is installed was developed. The model computes hourly performance based on TMY 2 weather data. Results indicated the importance of the control system in maximizing energy capture and validated the realistic option of a nighttime bypass mode. Results of simulations in seven locations across the state of New York indicated that, while substantial energy capture was possible, economic performance appeared to be marginal. Recovery ventilation (including both heat and energy recovery ventilation) offers another potentially attractive method of offsetting ventilation energy demand by preconditioning ventilation air. Heat and/or moisture are transferred between the exhaust and supply streams of the ventilation system, allowing the capture of ?waste? heat and moisture (or the lack of these two, depending on the season) from the exhaust stream. Recovery ventilation, which can also achieve very high efficiencies, has the advantage over solar technologies of operating continuously and unimpeded during both day and night and throughout the entire year since the heat/moisture exchange proceeds in either direction and is useful in both. Unfortunately, serious problems hampering the field performance of recovery ventilation systems have included low system flows and pressures and even flow reversal at exhaust terminals. A model of a typical high rise residential building was developed based on an existing Albany building involved in a recovery ventilation case study and exhibiting these problems. The model successfully predicted the key field observations of low pressures and flows along with flow reversal under certain conditions. Factors found to significantly affect ventilation system performance included stack effect, opening of windows, and duct leakage. Possible solution strategies were investigated including increasing system pressure, compartmentalization, and leakage reduction. An important finding was that typical operating pressures are most likely too low to resist external disturbances such as stack effect. However, significant duct leakage can pose a formiddable obstacle to achieving higher pressure systems. These results indicate the importance of considering both the necessary pressures for immunization against uncontrollable disturbances and the duct leakage present (in retrofit applications) in order to maximize the performance of recovery ventilation systems in the field.

40|$|This guide {{regarding}} {{energy recovery}} {{is one in}} a series on best practices for laboratories. It was produced by Laboratories for the 21 st Century ('Labs 21 '), a joint program of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U. S. Department of Energy. Laboratories typically require 100 % outside air for ventilation at higher rates than other commercial buildings. Minimum ventilation is typically provided at air change per hour (ACH) rates in accordance with codes and adopted design standards including Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 1910. 1450 (4 to 12 ACH - non-mandatory) or the 2011 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Applications Handbook, Chapter 16 - Laboratories (6 to 12 ACH). While OSHA states this minimum ventilation rate 'should not be relied on for protection from toxic substances released into the laboratory' it specifically indicates that it is intended to 'provide a source of air for breathing and for input to local ventilation devices (e. g., chemical fume hoods or exhausted bio-safety cabinets), to ensure that laboratory air is continually replaced preventing the increase of air concentrations of toxic substances during the working day, direct air flow into the laboratory from non-laboratory areas and out to the exterior of the building. ' The heating and cooling energy needed to condition and move this outside air can be 5 to 10 times greater than the amount of energy used in most office buildings. In addition, when the required ventilation rate exceeds the airflow needed to meet the cooling load in low-load laboratories, additional heating energy may be expended to reheat dehumidified supply air from the supply air condition to prevent over cooling. In addition to these low-load laboratories, reheat may also be required in adjacent spaces such as corridors that provide <b>makeup</b> <b>air</b> to replace air being pulled into negative-pressure laboratories. Various types of energy recovery devices and systems can substantially reduce heating and cooling energy required for conditioning spaces in laboratories. Heating and cooling systems can be downsized when energy recovery is used because these systems reduce peak heating and cooling requirements. Heating and cooling systems can also be downsized by capturing heat generated in high-load spaces and transferring it to spaces requiring reheat. There are many opportunities for energy recovery in laboratories. This guide includes descriptions of several air-to-air energy recovery devices and methods, such as using enthalpy wheels (Figure 1), heat pipes, or run-around loops in new construction. These devices generally recover energy from exhaust air. This recovered energy is used to precondition supply air during both cooling and heating modes of operation. In addition to air-to-air energy recovery options, this guide includes a description of a water-to-water heat recovery system that collects heat from high-load spaces and transfers it to spaces that require reheat. While air-to-air recovery devices provide significant energy reduction, in some laboratory facilities the amount of energy available in the exhaust air exceeds the pre-heat and pre-cooling needed to maintain supply air conditions. During these periods of time, controls typically reduce the energy recovery capacity to match the reduced load. If the energy recovered in the exhaust is not needed then it is rejected from the facility. By using a water-to-water recovery system, it is possible to significantly reduce overall building energy use by reusing heating or cooling energy generated in the building before it is rejected to the outdoors. Laboratory managers are encouraged to perform a life-cycle cost analysis of an energy-recovery technology to determine the feasibility of its application in their laboratory. Usually, the shortest payback periods occur when the heating and cooling load reduction provided by an energy recovery system allows the laboratory to install and use smaller heating (e. g., hot water or steam) and cooling (e. g., chilled water) systems that eliminate energy waste...|$|E
