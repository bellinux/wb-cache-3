When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is <b>modelled</b> by exponential kinetics.

40|$|To {{validate}} {{an estimated}} <b>model</b> {{and to have}} a good understanding of its reliability is a central aspect of System Identification. This contribution discusses these aspects in the light of <b>model</b> error <b>models</b> that are explicit descriptions of the <b>model</b> error. A <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> is implicitly present in most <b>model</b> validation methods, so the concept is more of a representation form than a set of new techniques. Traditional <b>model</b> validation is essentially a test of whether the confidence region of the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> contains the zero <b>model.</b> However, the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> allows a better visualization of the possible deficiencies of the nominal <b>model.</b> Based on such information, the nominal <b>model</b> may very well be accepted even if the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> does not contain the zero <b>model.</b> Conversely, it will be illustrated that the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> may give good reason - because of if its more precise infomation - to reject a nominal <b>model,</b> that has passed a conventional <b>model</b> validation test...|$|R

5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes <b>modelled</b> {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more {{elongated}} than the model predicted.

5|$|In the mid-20th century, organ {{builders}} {{began to}} build historically inspired instruments <b>modelled</b> on Baroque organs.

5|$|James Smith {{worked as}} a mason on the Bruce's {{rebuilding}} of Holyrood Palace. In 1683 he was appointed to be Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works, and was responsible for maintenance of Holyrood Palace, and refurbished the former Holyrood Abbey as a chapel royal for King James VII. With his father-in-law, the master mason Robert Mylne, Smith worked on Caroline Park in Edinburgh (1685), and Drumlanrig Castle (1680s). Smith's country houses followed the pattern established by William Bruce, with hipped roofs and pedimented fronts, in a plain but handsome Palladian style. His Canongate Kirk (1688–90) is a basilica-plan, with a baroque facade. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure <b>modelled</b> on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). Hamilton Palace (1695) was fronted by giant Corinthian columns, and a pedimented entrance, although was otherwise restrained. Dalkeith Palace (1702–10) was <b>modelled</b> after William of Orange's palace at Het Loo in the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the notions}} of viewpoints, <b>models</b> and {{channeling}} constraints, the paper introduces <b>model</b> induction, a systematic transformation of constraints in an existing <b>model</b> to constraints in another viewpoint. Meant to be a general CSP <b>model</b> operator, <b>model</b> induction is useful in generating redundant <b>models,</b> which can be further induced or combined with the original <b>model</b> or mutually redundant <b>models.</b> We propose three ways of combining redundant <b>models</b> using <b>model</b> induction, <b>model</b> channeling, and <b>model</b> intersection. Experimental results on the Langford's problem confirm that our proposed combined <b>models</b> exhibit improvements in efficiency and robustness over the original single <b>models...</b>|$|R
