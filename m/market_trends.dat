5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing <b>market</b> <b>trends.</b> The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E

25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers {{are more apt}} to follow short-term <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.|$|E

Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over Oblivions development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently formed 2K Games sub brand. According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, {{and it was a}} surprise that Bethesda's experience worked out as well as it did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a [...] "fantastic product" [...] with minimal interference or [...] "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers. [...] Ashley Cheng, Oblivions senior producer, concurred. There was [...] "complete freedom" [...] at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> might say.

500|$|By the 1970s, the {{popularity}} of the breed had decreased significantly, and there were approximately 400 Canadian horses worldwide, with only around five annual registrations between 1970 and 1974. Several interested breeders began a campaign of preservation and promotion, which resulted in a Canadian team winning the 1987 North American Driving Championships. Popularity began to increase, and by the mid-1990s population numbers were between 2,500 and 3,000, and The Livestock Conservancy, which had classified the breed as [...] "critical", changed its designation to [...] "rare". With the increase in popularity came pressure for the breed standard to change to meet modern show and <b>market</b> <b>trends,</b> by breeding for taller horses with more refinement. In 2002, the Canadian Horse Heritage and Preservation Society was formed in response to these pressures, with a goal of preserving the original Canadian horse type. The Canadian Horse Breeders Association remains the official registering body for the Canadian horse, as governed by the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act, with the responsibility to [...] "monitor registration, identification, and the keeping of the stud book for Canadian horses". It is also responsible for inspecting breeding stock before they are registered with the studbook. The studbook is maintained by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. Since the beginning of the studbook, there have been over 13,600 horses registered. In 2012, 208 new horses were registered, mainly in Quebec. The Livestock Conservancy still considers the breed to be threatened, a designation given to breeds with a global population of less than 5,000 and annual US registrations of fewer than 1,000. Rare Breeds Canada considers the breed to be at risk, with fewer than 500 annual registrations of female breeding stock.|$|E
500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the extract of the thesis „New Marketing as an Opportunity of Increasing Marketing Influence on Enterprise Competitiveness“ which was {{successfully}} defended in June 2007. New <b>marketing</b> <b>trends</b> are {{the future of}} marketing theory and business practice. Literature research follows new <b>marketing</b> <b>trends</b> from theoretical point of view. With respect to their number and a wide spectrum mainly of English literature, these trends could be grouped into four categories most frequented in literature. These trends are: - Electronic marketing - Value marketing - Relationship marketing and - Direct <b>marketing.</b> New <b>marketing</b> <b>trends</b> reflect the current tendencies in marketing. However, the firms should use them to increase their competitiveness. It‘s very {{important to realize that}} new <b>marketing</b> <b>trends</b> can‘t totally substitute traditional marketing forms. The firms have to adapt their marketing strategy to these trends. They are forced to realize one of these two marketing strategies: conservative (traditional) marketing - the main goal of this strategy is to persuade customers that the consumer value is still sufficiently high - or innovative marketing whose aim is to increase consumers‘ value. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} describe and appraise the current state of marketing and the new <b>marketing</b> (new <b>marketing</b> <b>trends)</b> influence on the competitive strength of companies and to prove the new marketing trends‘ intensifying impact in company managements based on theoreti- cal and field research.
