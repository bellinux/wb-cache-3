25|$|The {{intensity}} of initial nuclear radiation decreases rapidly with {{distance from the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>burst</b> because the radiation spreads over a larger area as it travels away from the explosion (the inverse-square law).

60|$|He saw {{her bosom}} heave. The storm against {{which she had}} been {{struggling}} all the time seemed on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting.</b> The hot blood was singing in her ears, her eyes were aflame.

60|$|I {{stood by}} the side of Darius {{trembling}} with apprehension, and even amid my fear I took note of the fact that Jerry was feeling far from comfortable in mind, while the old man chewed incessantly on a huge piece of tobacco that caused his cheeks to swell out as if on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nicht nachmachen! (English: Don't Imitate!) is a German comedy-documentary TV {{series that}} airs on ZDF and ZDFneo. The two hosts, Wigald Boning and Bernhard Hoëcker, defy the {{warnings}} and restrictions on various items {{to see what}} happens when they do. Some of their experiments include lighting fireworks inside a living room and trying to overfill a water bed to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting.</b>|$|R
60|$|Her lips quivered and {{her voice}} broke, and Wulf hurried away without saying another word, for {{he felt that he}} himself was at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> into tears. Harold was anxiously {{awaiting}} his return, and after listening to the message turned abruptly and entered his private closet, with a wave of the hand signifying that Wulf would not be further required.|$|R
60|$|After dinner Mrs. Ross came in. Mrs. Ross lived down on {{the shore}} road and made a living {{for herself and her}} two {{children}} by washing and doing days' work out. She was not a very cheerful person and generally spoke as if on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> into tears. She looked more doleful than ever today, and lost no time in explaining why.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Harry {{was on the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> out indignantly, but he checked himself and without a word went on with his writing, {{although}} tears of disappointment for a time almost blinded him; but he felt it would be hopeless to urge the point further, and that did he do so he might forfeit the opportunity he now had of learning what was going on.|$|R

60|$|Each of {{the guests}} had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate. Baucis (who rubbed her eyes, {{in order to see}} the more clearly) was of opinion that the {{clusters}} had grown larger and richer, and that each separate grape seemed to be on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> with ripe juice. It was entirely a mystery to her how such grapes could ever have been produced from the old stunted vine that climbed against the cottage wall.|$|R

50|$|Krazy's {{train is}} so full that its cars bulge {{almost to the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting.</b> Nevertheless, it remains in one piece. And {{although}} he manages to get a ride, Krazy has to avoid getting smushed by the passengers. When the train reaches its destination, the passengers come out flat, and a station employee has to inflate them with a pump. Krazy is in a worse situation as he is in pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Fortunately, the station employee puts him back together on time.|$|R
6000|$|Moonlight was not {{as deeply}} {{impressed}} with her [...] "luck" [...] as the old lady expected, {{and was on the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> out, after the manner of savages, into a torrent of abuse of the Blackfoot race in general, and of Rushing River in particular, when the thought that she was a captive and {{at the mercy of the}} Blackfeet fortunately restrained her. Instead of answering, she cast her eyes on the ground and remained stolidly silent, by which conduct she got credit for undeserved modesty.|$|R
6000|$|But for {{the most}} part Tarzan had fed well always. Today, though, he had gone empty, one misfortune {{following}} another as rapidly as he raised new quarry, so that now, as he sat perched in the tree above the feasting blacks, he experienced all the pangs of famine and his hatred for his lifelong enemies waxed strong in his breast. It was tantalizing, indeed, to sit there hungry while these Gomangani filled themselves so full of food that their stomachs seemed almost upon the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting,</b> and with elephant steaks at that! ...|$|R
60|$|Ashe's first {{impression}} of Beach, the butler, {{was one of}} tension. Other people, confronted {{for the first time}} with Beach, had felt the same. He had that strained air of being on the very <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> that one sees in bullfrogs and toy balloons. Nervous and imaginative men, meeting Beach, braced themselves involuntarily, stiffening their muscles for the explosion. Those who had the pleasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this stage, just as people whose homes are on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius become immune to fear of eruptions.|$|R
60|$|She felt a wild rush of loneliness. She had {{a sudden}} {{realization}} of how dear that gaunt old figure was, with its grizzled face and ready smile. Her breath came quick and quicker, and {{she was at the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> into a wild cry to Tewksbury when she heard a strange noise. It came from the barn, a creaking noise. She looked that way and saw in the shadowed side a deeper shadow moving to and fro. A revulsion to astonishment and anger took place in her.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} program, it was desired {{to better understand the}} impact of the rotating chamber alignment with the barrel throat on the precision and accuracy of a novel cased telescoped (CT) ammunition firing rifle. In order to perform the study, a baseline CT ammunition chamber which was concentric with a Mann barrel bore was manufactured. Additionally, six chambers were manufactured with an offset relative to the barrel bore. These chambers were used to simulate a misaligned chamber relative to the bore axis. Precision and accuracy tests were then performed at 200 [*]m in an indoor range under controlled conditions. For this project, 5. 56 [*]mm CT ammunition was used. As the chamber axis offset relative to the gun bore was increased, the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact was displaced away from the target center. The shift in the impact location is explained by the presence of in-bore yaw which results in lateral throw-off and aerodynamic jump components. The linear theory of ballistics is used to establish a relationship between the chamber misalignment and the resulting projectile <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact for a rifle developed to fire CT ammunition. This relationship allows for the prediction <b>of</b> the <b>mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact given a chamber misalignment...|$|R
50|$|<b>Mean</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact (MPI) is the {{calculated}} {{center of the}} grouping, which is the average center of all the shots, and is not necessarily located at {{a hole in the}} target. The size of the grouping is described as the smallest circle containing all the shots.|$|R

60|$|And now {{the door}} opened, and Master Rodolph entered, {{carrying}} {{in his hand}} a white wand, and bowing very reverently as he ushered in servants bearing a cold collation. As he entered, it was with difficulty that he could settle his countenance into the due and requisite degree of gravity; and so often was the fat steward on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> into laughter, as he arranged the setting out of the refreshments on the table, that the Prince, with whom {{he was at the}} same time both u favourite and a butt, at last noticed his unusual and unmanageable risibility.|$|R

50|$|The {{tower was}} the focal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> several <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> anti-Victorian {{sentiment}} in Brighton {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries; as such it fulfilled a similar function to the Albert Memorial in London's Kensington Gardens, which was occasionally the scene of similar local and national demonstrations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, why indeed?" [...] said Ned, with a frown. At this {{critical}} {{point in the}} conversation, little Fred, who was afraid that a storm was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting</b> forth, chanced to overturn his tin mug of tea. His mother {{was one of those}} obtuse women who regard an accident as a sin, to be visited by summary punishment. Her usual method of inflicting punishment was by means of an open-handed slap {{on the side of the}} head. On this occasion she dealt out the measure of justice with such good-will, that poor little Fred was sent sprawling and howling on the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The Irish {{name for}} Cheekpoint is [...] "Pointe na Síge", or perhaps [...] "Pointe na Sí" [...] (in English, <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> the Fairies).

5000|$|The Furmint grapes begin {{maturation}} {{with thick}} skins, {{but as they}} ripen the skins become thinner, and transparent. This allows the sun to penetrate the grape and evaporate much of the liquid inside, producing a higher concentration of sugar. Other types of grapes mature to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>bursting,</b> however, unlike most other grapes, Furmint will grow a second skin which seals it from rot. This also {{has the effect of}} concentrating the grape's natural sugars. The grapes are left on the vine long enough to develop the [...] "noble rot" [...] (Botrytis cinerea) mold. Grapes then are harvested, sometimes as late as December (and in the case of true Eszencia, occasionally into January).|$|R
