A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{characterization}} method for verifying stability and measuring the performance quality of arbitrary noise transfer functions for the delta-sigma modulator is presented. The method consists of first obtaining the <b>maximum</b> stable <b>input</b> range sweep in the pass-band. The variance estimate {{can then be}} used to make a sharper upper limit for <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>input</b> range. This can then be used to measure the global SNR performance in the pass-band. The proposed method enables us to make a comprehensive comparison between arbitrary noise transfer function designs and it {{can also be used to}} automate the design of noise transfer functions.

25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the <b>maximum</b> <b>input</b> voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.|$|E

30|$|The {{test results}} shown in Fig.  3; Table  1 will {{indicate}} the following characteristic behavior of nailed plywood-timber joints under composite waves: (1) Nailed plywood-timber joints are prone to fail in typical static failure modes in relatively higher probability, when they are shaken under strong <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations equivalent to their ultimate limits. (2) When <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations are not so strong, they can withstand comparatively longer the typical static failures. If active shakes continue only for short time under the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations within their damage limits, then, nailed plywood-timber joints are able to survive with no fatal failures. If active shakes continue for long time or repeat intermittently, however, they {{are in danger of}} fatal failures even though the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations do not exceed their damage limits. In this case, nailed plywood-timber joints are prone to fail in relatively higher probability of low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of nails than typical static failures.|$|R

30|$|In the {{previous}} dynamic tests under harmonic waves of frequencies from 2 to 7  Hz, the authors observed clear frequency {{dependence of the}} dynamic responses of nailed plywood-timber joints [1]. The test results shown in Figs.  4 and 5 also confirmed the frequency dependence of the same nailed joints under a band-limited white-noise wave composed of discrete frequencies from 1 to 8  Hz. Under the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> acceleration of 165  gal, the nailed plywood-timber joints responded most sensitively to the highest frequency component of 8  Hz for the first period from 1 to 7  s and the sensitive frequencies became gradually lower as the cumulative shake increased from the first period to the third period as shown in Fig.  5. This transition of the sensitive frequencies {{is the result of}} the nonlinear load-slip relationships and the cyclic stiffness degradation of nailed timber joints, which are commonly observed both under static and dynamic loadings [1, 10 – 14]. As the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> acceleration increased, the sensitive frequencies at the first period became lower as shown in Fig.  5. The sensitive frequencies to the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations of 165, 330 and 495  gal are related to the equivalent linear secant stiffness at these accelerations on the equivalent envelope acceleration-slip curves in Fig.  3 [1]. When the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> acceleration was 330 gal, they responded most sensitively to the frequency of 5  Hz for the first period, and the most sensitive frequency decreased to 2  Hz for the second and third periods on the average. An important result shown in Fig.  5 is that the distribution of responsive acceleration ratios under the wave of the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> acceleration of 330  gal for the second and third periods are close to that under the wave of the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> acceleration of 495  gal for the first period. This result indicates that nailed timber joints are in danger of resonating with the frequency components equivalent to the linear secant stiffness at their ultimate limits, if they are shaken for long times with or without intermittences, even though the <b>input</b> <b>maximum</b> accelerations do not exceed their damage limit accelerations.|$|R

40|$|Salt marsh cores are {{increasingly}} being used to study metal pollution chronologies. Salt marshes in macro-tidal estuaries, however, tend to retain a time-integrated or ‘smoothed’ signal rather than a record of discrete pollutant inputs, due to extensive sediment reworking. More generally, an accurate chronology of metal input to salt marsh sediments {{can be difficult to}} assess because of the potential early-diagenetic mobility of both the radionuclides used for dating and the contaminants of interest. A dated salt marsh core from the macro-tidal Medway Estuary, southeast England, was assessed using both total sediment metal data and partitioning data. These data indicate that both Mn and Fe have been significantly remobilised and that these diagenetic processes have slightly modified the vertical distributions of Cu, Pb and Zn. Zinc is the most diagenetically reactive followed by Cu and then Pb.
