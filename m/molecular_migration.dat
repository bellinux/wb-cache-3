40|$|Correlations of the {{chemical}} structures of products from organic solid state reactions with the molecular packing in the reactant crystal structures define the extent of lattice restraints on molecular motion before and during reaction. The molecular behaviour after {{the chemical}} transition state can be inferred from comparisons of the molecular orientations in the initial and final phases. The formation of preferentially oriented product phases suggests that highly specific geometrical mechanisms are operative but additional criteria are needed to establish a direct correspondence between specific reactant and product molecules. Observable intermediate mesomorphic phases are particularly useful in defining the directions in which crystallographic order is not preserved. Several studies of hydrolysis, isomerization and polymerization reactions suggest surprisingly large <b>molecular</b> <b>migrations</b> and conformational changes may occur without randomizing the total distribution of product molecules. Competing and consecutive transformations often give rise to several simultaneously present and mutually oriented product phases and, in some cases, large molecular moieties of the initial structure do not appear {{in any of the}} final ordered phases. Novel twinning frequently is observed when degenerate transformation mechanisms give rise to several preferred orienta-tions of product structures which cannot reorganize to form a single phase of long-range order. While the short-range molecular arrangement in the oriented product phase usually is identical with that produced during conventional crystallizations, exceptions may be found in the formation of chemically unstable molecular structures or metastable polymorphs of the product phase...|$|R

On the clean surface CO dissociates most easily from di-bridge (DB) sites with both carbon and oxygen atoms interacting with the surface via a tilted configuration.

From a fundamental perspective, foods are mainly edible and digestible biopolymers that are partially crystalline/partially amorphous and thus edible films, specifically chitosan/glycerol films can be very interesting foodmodel systems for mobility andmicrostructure studies. Studies on water and solids'mobility and thermo-mechanical properties in food systems (real ormodel systems) are fundamental to fully attain food physical properties and stability. These studies may be extremely useful for food product and process design, safety and sensorial attributes and also for better understanding and predicting, for example, food storage stability conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} predict cell {{behavior}} {{in response to}} changes in its surroundings or to modifications of its genetic code, the dynamics of a cell are modeled using equations of metabolism, transport, transcription and translation implemented in the Karyote software. Our methodology accounts for the organelles of eukaryotes and the specialized zones in prokaryotes by dividing {{the volume of the}} cell into discrete compartments. Each compartment exchanges mass with others either through membrane transport or with a time delay effect associated with <b>molecular</b> <b>migration.</b> Metabolic and macromolecular reactions take place in user-specified compartments. Coupling among processes are accounted for and multiple scale techniques allow for the computation of processes that occur {{on a wide range of}} time scales. Our model is implemented to simulate the evolution of concentrations for a user-specifiable set of molecules and reactions that participate in cellular activity. The underlying equations integrate metabolic, transcription and translation reaction networks and provide a framework for simulating whole cells given a user-specified set of reactions. A rate equation formulation is used to simulate transcription from an input DNA sequence while the resulting mRNA is used via ribosome-mediated polymerization kinetics to accomplish translation. Feedback associated with the creation of species necessary for metabolism by the mRNA and protein synthesis modifies the rates of production of factors (e. g. nucleotides and amino acids) that affect the dynamics of transcription and translation. The concentrations of predicted proteins are compared with time series or steady state experiments. The expression and sequence of the predicted proteins are compared with experimental data via the construction of synthetic tryptic digests and associated mass spectra. We present the mathematical model showing the coupling of transcription, translatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} velocity, {{the migratory}} activation {{energy and the}} action of <b>molecular</b> motion on <b>migration</b> were researched for five alkanes in the gas-solid chromatography of N(2) /GDX- 101 system. Maxwell distribution of energy which originally shows the molecule fraction of molecular translation energy exceeding E, was used for expressing the time fraction of the translation energy exceeding E. The kinetic energy of rotation and vibration was expressed by the times of kT/ 2 {{in the light of}} the principle of equiparation of energy, to modify the ideal equation. The migratory activation energy (E) which is calculated with the rate equation, could well explain the migration velocity. The kinetic energy of rotation and vibration observably influences E. These properties were also authenticated with the estimate of statistical thermodynamics. The calculation showed that E was obviously smaller than the desorption enthalpy (Delta H(Desorption)). The solute migration might not reach the state of desorption. The solute driven by mobile phase should mainly slip under the state of adsorption...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInhibitory interneurons (INs) {{critically}} {{control the}} excitability and plasticity of neuronal networks, but whether activity can direct INs into specific circuits during development is unknown. Here, {{we report that}} in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which relays retinal input to the cortex, circuit activity {{is required for the}} <b>migration,</b> <b>molecular</b> differentiation, and functional integration of INs. We first characterize the prenatal origin and molecular identity of dLGN INs, revealing their recruitment from an Otx 2 + neuronal pool located in the adjacent ventral LGN. Using time-lapse and electrophysiological recordings, together with genetic and pharmacological perturbation of retinal waves, we show that retinal activity directs the navigation and circuit incorporation of dLGN INs during the first postnatal week, thereby regulating the inhibition of thalamocortical circuits. These findings identify an input-dependent mechanism regulating IN migration and circuit inhibition, which may account for the progressive recruitment of INs into expanding excitatory circuits during evolution...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} a breakdown in central or peripheral self-tolerance, resulting in the initiation of pathogenic immune responses against self. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressing the transcription factor forkhead box P 3 (FoxP 3) are potent regulators of peripheral self-tolerance. Defects in the number or function of Tregs have been associated with the development of many autoimmune diseases, generating interest in the use of Tregs as cell-based immunotherapy. However, uncertainty regarding the identification, stability and function of human Tregs has prevented the application of Tregs as therapy for autoimmune diseases. Such research demonstrates that Tregs are a heterogeneous population with varying regulatory phenotypes and the potential to convert into pro-inflammatory T-helper 17 cells. Therefore, prior to using Tregs as cellular therapy for autoimmune disease, these potential drawbacks must be fully investigated. In this thesis I describe in detail the development, classification, <b>migration,</b> <b>molecular</b> characterisation and stability of Tregs. In addition to, proposing a new protocol for the isolation of highly pure FoxP 3 + Tregs to be used as immunotherapy for autoimmune disease. ...|$|R
