40|$|We {{present the}} {{tunneling}} characteristics of HTSC break junctions realized on high quality c-axis oriented YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (Y- 123) and TI 2 Ba 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (TI- 2212) thin films, with T-c (rho = 0) = 91 K and T-c (rho = 0) = 110 K, respectively. By means of this technique, the coupling {{of the two}} electrodes can be varied {{as a function of}} the externally piloted movements of a <b>micrometric</b> <b>screw.</b> The characteristics are measured in the q-p tunneling regime for different directions. Along the nodal directions. we observe a huge zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP), and gap-related structures at low biases for both materials. For tunneling directions close to (100), the conductance curves show gap-related maxima at about +/- 20 and +/- 40 mV for Y- 123 and at about +/- 25 and +/- 50 mV for the TI- 2212. In these cases. the ZBCP is highly depressed (5 %) or completely absent. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Superconducting micro-constrictions between Nb {{tips and}} high quality MgB_ 2 pellets have been {{realized}} {{by means of}} a point-contact inset, driven by a <b>micrometric</b> <b>screw.</b> Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics and of the dynamical conductance versus bias have been performed in the temperature range between 4. 2 K and 500 K. Above the Nb critical temperature T_C^Nb, the conductance of the MgB_ 2 /normal-metal constrictions behaves as predicted by the BTK model for low resistance contacts while high resistance junctions show quasiparticle tunneling characteristics. Consistently, from the whole set of data we infer the value Δ_π = 2. 5 ± 0. 2 meV for the three-dimensional gap of MgB_ 2. Below T_C^Nb, low resistance contacts show Josephson current and subharmonic gap structures (SGS), due to multiple Andreev reflections. Simultaneous observations of both features, unambiguously indicate coupling of the 3 D band of MgB_ 2 with the Nb superconducting order parameter. We found that the temperature dependence of the Josephson critical current follows the classical Ambegaokar-Baratoff behavior with a value I_CR_N=(2. 1 ± 0. 1) meV at low temperatures.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} are going towards miniaturized devices and structures. Besides advanced photolithography techniques, complementary patterning methods are evolving. Among {{them is the}} nanostencil technique. Schematic overview of setup in operation: the shadow mask is mounted onto a stage of three actuators. They allow movement in x, y and z dimensions. Thus the mask is moved relative to the substrate and in its proximity. This technique is about defining patterns under vacuum by evaporation of metal through stencil apertures. Such a stencil can be used either in static or dynamic mode. The later offers the possibility to custom defined structures; in particular three dimensional and negative structures are possible. It {{is the goal of}} this project to do depositions in dynamic mode with an existing monolithic piezo actuated stage. During this work a setup has been enhanced into a usable tool. The mask, which is expendable due to clogging, is now interchangeable thanks to a mask holder, which uses lateral clamping. The movements in x and y direction are generated with a monolithic piezo actuator. The approach of the mask to the substrate in z-direction is made manually with <b>micrometric</b> <b>screws.</b> AFM images of a dynamic stencil deposition. A series of experiments were made. Nanostencils with regular arrays of apertures, which had diameters in the micron range, were used. Elliptic depositions were patterned a Si wafer. Further a line has been deposited, where the depositions of different apertures of the matrix were interconnected due to the movement of the mask in order to build a long line...|$|R
40|$|As a bibliographic {{research}} has shown the absence of machines of the type requested, it has been necessary to design, build and test a new cycling-loads machine capable to measure the micro-mechanical characteristics of flax fibers like Young modulus, tensile strength and the loss factor. The flax fibers in question have diameters of 5 - 25 μm and lengths of 1 - 3 mm. The requirements for the testing machine are to furnish the stress-strain parameters, with an uncertainty not greater than 10 %, relative to different loading-unloading cycles measuring fibers from 1 mm to 30 mm long, with 1 % strain, {{a resolution of the}} order of 0. 1 μm and capable to measure forces up to 0. 5 N with a resolution better than 2 μN. The design problems have been solved by employing a mechanical lever displaced by a <b>micrometric</b> <b>screw</b> to impose the displacements and by using an analytical balance, properly calibrated to measure the corresponding forces. The single flax fibers have been glued on particular polyester bases build up for the purpose. The machine has been used to date fibers coming from the Turin Shroud. To reach this purpose, proper calibration curves have been determined using a series of ancient flax textiles. The Turin Shroud fibers resulted of 400 AD with an uncertainty of ± 400 years at 95 % confidence level, thus compatible with the epoch in which Jesus Christ lived in Palestine...|$|E
