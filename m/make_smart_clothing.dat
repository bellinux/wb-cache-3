In this paper, we explore how to extend {{time domain reflectometry}} in order to touch-enable thin, modular, and deformable surfaces and devices. We demonstrate how to use this approach to <b>make</b> <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> and to rapid prototype touch sensitive objects of arbitrary shape. To accomplish this, we extend time domain reflectometry in three ways: (1) Thin: We demonstrate how to run time domain reflectometry on a single wire. This allows us to touch-enable thin metal objects, such as guitar strings. (2) Modularity: We present a two-pin connector system that allows users to daisy chain touch-sensitive segments. We illustrate these enhancements with 13 prototypes {{and a series of}} performance measurements. (3) Deformability: We create deformable touch devices by mounting stretchable wire patterns onto elastic tape and meshes. We present selected performance measurements.

And with the problem of global population aging, the need for more services with higher quality in eldercare environment is poised to become significant. Advances in micro technologies, flexible sensors and related technologies <b>make</b> a new <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> can be developed to enhance the efficiency of eldercare, illness and unpredictable event prevention with monitoring and alarming method. This master thesis provides a design of a smart-clothing platform based on embedded and wearable technology, which is a continuous monitoring to track the physical activities, physiological status and achieves automatic outdoor positioning for the elderly. Based on sensor network technology and Qt Creator development environment, the platform uses a greater number of sensor nodes to detect the different parts of the body to improve the detection accuracy. Front-end system uses STC 12 C 5 A 60 S 2 microcontroller as the central node to receive the data of each sub-node, and through the wireless network data transfer to the PC for analysis. PC research algorithm to deal with the relevant data. Finally, the human-computer interface display and store results. Compared with traditional <b>smart</b> <b>clothing,</b> this system can provide a multifunctional specialization monitoring for elderly who need extra cares. This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 is an introduction including the <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> concept, the review of previous works, motivations, and the objectives of this thesis is also given in this chapter. Chapter 2 introduces system functions and the whole design scheme which covers both the hardware and software design. In chapter 3, the advanced relevant algorithms used for posture recognition is presented in order to provide the necessary knowledge, and the final algorithm used in this thesis is explained in this chapter. The chapter 4 and 5 respectively introduce the system hardware implementation and the software implementation. The system consists of wearable nodes (6 subnodes and 1 central node) and PC human-computer interaction interface, which are explained in detail in both chapters. Chapter 6 shows the experimental results of this smart-clothing platform and analyzes them in turn. On the basis of Chapter 6, Chapter 7 concludes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this system and gives the recommendations for future works.

5000|$|E-textiles, {{also known}} as <b>smart</b> garments, <b>smart</b> <b>clothing,</b> {{electronic}} textiles, <b>smart</b> textiles, or smart fabrics, are fabrics that enable digital components (including small computers), and electronics to be embedded in them. Smart textiles are fabrics {{that have been developed}} with new technologies that provide added value to the wearer. Pailes-Friedman of the Pratt Institute states that [...] "what <b>makes</b> <b>smart</b> fabrics revolutionary is that they have the ability to do many things that traditional fabrics cannot, including communicate, transform, conduct energy and even grow". Smart textiles can be broken into two different categories: aesthetic and performance enhancing. Aesthetic examples include fabrics that light up and fabrics that can change color. Some of these fabrics gather energy from the environment by harnessing vibrations, sound or heat, reacting to these inputs. Performance enhancing smart textiles are intended for use in athletic, extreme sports and military applications. These include fabrics designed to regulate body temperature, reduce wind resistance, and control muscle vibration - all of which may improve athletic performance. Other fabrics have been developed for protective clothing, to guard against extreme environmental hazards, such as radiation and the effects of space travel. The health and beauty industry is also taking advantage of these innovations, which range from drug-releasing medical textiles, to fabric with moisturizer, perfume, and anti-aging properties. Many <b>smart</b> <b>clothing,</b> wearable technology, and wearable computing projects involve the use of e-textiles.|$|R

The researches about technologies innovation and application of <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> can be found in previous studies. But consumer researches about perception or attitude toward <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> can be hardly found. Therefore, we proposed a conceptual framework that explores the impact of perceived risks on perceived attributes to adopt <b>smart</b> <b>clothing.</b> In addition, we compared differences of this framework among three counties – Korea, U.

After data analysis using Amos 7. 0, the results can be concluded as following: First, the influences of psychological risk among Korea, U. S. and Spain are same. Psychological risk has negative effect on relative advantage and complexity, but has positive effect on trialability. Second, loss risk was found to {{have nothing to do with}} relative advantage. But it negatively influences complexity for Korean consumers and positively influences trialability for both Korean and American consumers. Third, the influences of performance risk for different consumers are different. At last, based on our discussion, some implications were also concluded...|$|R

This paper discusses a numerical algorithm to simulate the multiscale heat and moisture transfer in the thermal <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> system. A group of multiscale nonlinear models are proposed to describe the mix-type coupled heat and moisture transfer in the human body, fabrics, fiber material, and phase change material (PCM) particles. The dynamic thermal boundary conditions among individuals are considered and described to integrate the multiscale models. The coupled partial differential equations of the models are discretized by the finite volume method, and the numerical scheme for the thermal <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> simulation are developed considering the specification of wearing scenarios. To validate the models and simulation scheme, the simulation results and experimental results with the same clothing and wearing conditions are compared and discussed. Furthermore, a series of simulation cases are made to present the application of this numerical algorithm in practical design by expressing a sequence of design issues through the simulation results for the designers. This simulation scheme is helpful in the engineering design process of thermal <b>smart</b> <b>clothing</b> to identify the thermal quality of the clothing in advance and thus reduce the design cost.
