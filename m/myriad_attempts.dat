5000|$|Overall, {{there is}} a strong {{consensus}} regarding the central theoretical questions and the central problems that emerge from explicating such questions. Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change? In the <b>myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> to answer these questions, three predominately theoretical (i.e. not empirical) problems emerge. These problems are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following [...] "big three" [...] dichotomies: subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and diachrony. The first deals with knowledge, the second with agency, and the last with time. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A recent {{revival of}} global {{interest}} for reconstruction of long-segment tracheal defects, which {{represents one of}} the most interesting and complex problems in head and neck and thoracic reconstructive surgery, has been witnessed. The trachea functions as a conduit for air, and its subunits including the epithelial layer, hyaline cartilage, and segmental blood supply make it particularly challenging to reconstruct. A <b>myriad</b> of <b>attempts</b> at replacing the trachea have been described. These along with the anatomy, indications, and approaches including microsurgical tracheal reconstruction will be reviewed. Novel techniques such as tissue-engineering approaches will also be discussed. Multiple attempts at replacing the trachea with synthetic scaffolds have been met with failure. The main lesson learned from such failures is that the trachea must not be treated as a “simple tube. ” Understanding the anatomy, developmental biology, physiology, and diseases affecting the trachea are required for solving this problem...|$|R
40|$|There {{are clear}} {{benefits}} associated with a particular consumer choice for many current markets. For example, as we consider here, some products might carry environmental or `green' benefits. Some consumers might value these benefits while others do not. However, as evidenced by <b>myriad</b> failed <b>attempts</b> of environmental products to maintain even a niche market, such benefits do not necessarily outweigh the extra purchasing cost. The question we pose is, how can such an initially economically-disadvantaged green product evolve to hold the greater share of the market? We present a simple mathematical model for the dynamics of product competition in a heterogeneous consumer population. Our model preassigns a hierarchy to the products, which designates the consumer choice when prices are comparable, while prices are dynamically rescaled to reflect increasing returns to scale. Our approach allows us to model many scenarios of technology substitution and provides a method for generalizing market forces. With this model, we begin to forecast irreversible trends associated with consumer dynamics as well as policies {{that could be made}} to influence transition...|$|R

The organization of materials in space has been central to most human attempts at configuring a placement {{of their lives in}} the larger schemes of the cosmos, nature, and social strata. Through sculptural organizations of form, line, and image, the works present my sustained effort in seeking a place within this catalog of human expressive problem solving. Through interdisciplinary studies of a variety of subjects, I have assembled a catalog of historical precedents to the work that range from Stonehenge to American Modernist Literature, primitive markings in the bellies of the earth to sites of modern industrial wastes, the tenets of mythology and archetypal forms such as vessels, flowers, and maps of the stars. As these various sources are filtered through aesthetic explorations in material and spatial situation I hope to create a graceful narrative or picture of how humans have confronted those archetypal forms in the world through a <b>myriad</b> of <b>attempts</b> at configuring some position within it.

40|$|Abstract—Buggy device {{drivers are}} {{a major threat to}} the {{reliability}} of their host operating system. There have been <b>myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> to protect the kernel, but most of them either required driver modifications or incur substantial performance overhead. This paper describes an isolated device driver execution system called SIDE (Streamlined Isolated Driver Execution), which focuses specifically on unmodified device drivers and strives to avoid changing the existing kernel code as much as possible. SIDE exploits virtual memory hardware to set up a device driver execution environment that is compatible with existing device drivers and yet is fully isolated from the kernel. SIDE is able to run an unmodified device driver for a Gigabit Ethernet NIC and the latency and throughput penalty is kept under 1 % when augmented with a set of performance optimizations designed {{to reduce the number of}} protection domain crossings between an isolated device driver and the kernel.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{qualitative}} study of 10 adult women 2 ̆ 7 s experience of having been sexually abused in childhood, research participants recalled their responses, as children, to sexual abuse. <b>Myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> to escape were reported. These encompassed both physical action and mental processes. Those who could escaped physically, either by running away, keeping busy or dressing protectively. Others engaged in mental processes ranging through pretending the sexual abuse was not happening, daydreaming, isolation of affect and dissociation to partial or complete repression of memory of the abuse. These responses are conceptualized as falling along a continuum from conscious and voluntary to unconscious and involuntary. Despite this complex array of attempts to escape from sexual abuse, {{most of the research}} participants continued to blame themselves for the abuse. It is suggested that an understanding of the complexity and diversity of escape as a response to sexual abuse could assist sexually abused children, and adult survivors of sexual abuse, to come to accept more readily their lack of culpability for the abuse...|$|E
40|$|Discussions of ‘control’ {{in games}} often center on players and their <b>myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to push back}} upon the systems that seek to {{constrain}} them. The fact that players resist the constraints imposed upon them is not surprising, nor is it surprising that counterplay and control are such rich topics for game studies academics. In this article, I argue that players are invited by games to bend the rules. It is in {{the very nature of}} play to find the movement between the rules, and for many players the ‘fun’ in play is the inherent challenge of attempting to master, defeat, or remake games’ formal structures. These rationalities of play preclude blind obedience to the rules and have distinct implications for how games are governed. While there have been numerous studies of players who bend or break the rules (Consalvo, 2007; Foo and Koivisto, 2004; Dibbell, 1998; Kolko and Reid, 1998; Williams, 2006; Mnookin, 1997) and players who alter and re-make the rules in their role of co-producers (Sotamaa, 2009; Kücklich, 2005; Humphreys, 2005; Taylor, 2006 b), there is little research on game development companies and their attempts to harness these rationalities of play and uphold the rules beyond the reflexive writings of game designers themselves (Curtis, 1992; Morningstar and Farmer, 1991; Koster, 2002) ...|$|E

25|$|With {{the firm}} {{guidance}} of 'ulema', the diverse native traditions were transformed to a uniform mold that crossed borders and customs. The original diverse traditions were consistently {{shaped to conform}} to specific norms embedded in the Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to the mothers, and protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering mothers and daughters, incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While {{the best of the}} Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of Sufi mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law (Sharia) and concept of waging violent external jihad against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a <b>myriad</b> of <b>attempts</b> to curb it, Sufism has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.|$|R

Within this context, there have been <b>myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> to optimize the different stages in the design process by using computerization, but a growing proportion of current research work on design tends to agree that the crucial point in the act of designing lies in the phase where inventive ideas are sought and that without such ideas being generated, there is no successful future for the product.

Originally, since the theory has penetrated the so-called occidental world, every individual took from TRIZ what he thought was right according to his own knowledge about design, problem solving process, creativity or needs forgetting that 95 % of scientific literature about TRIZ’s fundamentals was written either in Cyrillic or in unpublished manuscripts. In most cases, theses multitudes of uses did not see that the original idea of TRIZ was to formulate a theory as strong basement for building methods and tools to satisfy designers expectations.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the feminist jurisprudence performed by three early birth control advocates: Annie Besant, Jane Hume Clapperton, and Marie Stopes. In {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, the subject of birth control was so taboo that serious efforts were made to keep John Stuart Mill from being buried in Westminster Abbey because of his sympathies with the idea of family limitation. The threat of being charged with obscenity and immorality, whether in a legal indictment, in a literary review, or in the court of public opinion, effectively silenced much public discourse on this important social issue. Besant, Clapperton and Stopes, however, dared to speak out. Annie Besant published a tract on birth control and defended herself in court against charges of obscene libel in a highly publicized 1877 trial. The writer Jane Hume Clapperton took the unprecedented step of advocating for the use of artificial birth control in a novel, Margaret Dunmore; or, A Socialist Home (1888). Marie Stopes wrote two runaway bestsellers on the topic, Married Love (1918) and Wise Parenthood (1918), and opened the first birth control clinic in England in 1921. These three women used legal and literary public forums to foreground women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences and to expose the devastating real-life effects of denying women access to knowledge about family limitation. An analysis of their work and the <b>myriad</b> <b>attempts</b> to keep them quiet illumines the ways in which indirect control of access to information on birth control served to regulate women 2 ̆ 7 s bodies and maintain traditionally-held cultural beliefs about 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 mothering and female sexuality. The stories of Besant, Clapperton and Stopes impress on the historical record that, despite all legal, extralegal, and illegal efforts to censor and censure those who were publicizing contraceptive information, word was getting out. As the regulation of motherhood, reproductive health, rights, and access continue to be pressing twenty-first-century concerns, there is much to be learned from the revisionary strategies of these early advocates...|$|E
40|$|Multi-scale {{modeling}} of biological systems has recently become fashionable {{due to the}} growing power of digital computers {{as well as to}} the growing realization that integrative systems behavior is as important to life as is the genome. While it is true that the behavior of a living organism must ultimately be traceable to all its components and their <b>myriad</b> interactions, <b>attempting</b> to codify this in its entirety in a model misses the insights gained from understanding how collections of system components at one level of scale conspire to produce qualitatively different behavior at higher levels. The essence of multi-scale modeling thus lies not in the inclusion of every conceivable biological detail, but rather in the judicious selection of emergent phenomena appropriate to the level of scale being modeled. These principles are exemplified in recent computational models of the lung. Airways responsiveness, for example, is an organ-level manifestation of events that begin at the molecular level within airway smooth muscle cells, yet it is not necessary to invoke all these molecular events to accurately describe the contraction dynamics of a cell, nor is it necessary to invoke all phenomena observable at the level of the cell to account for the changes in overall lung function that occur following methacholine challenge. Similarly, the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone has complex origins within the individual smooth muscle cells that line the blood vessels but, again, many of the fine details of cell behavior average out at the level of the organ to produce an effect on pulmonary vascular pressure that can be described in much simpler terms. The art of multi-scale lung modeling thus reduces not to being limitlessly inclusive, but rather to knowing what biological details to leave out...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite a <b>myriad</b> of <b>attempts</b> in {{the last}} three decades to {{diagnose}} ovarian cancer (OC) earlier, this clinical aim still remains a significant challenge. Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i. e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating cancer presence. Methods: We analyzed 699 cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using a methylation array or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to discover the most specific OC methylation patterns. A three-DNA-methylation-serum-marker panel was developed using targeted ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in 151 women and validated in 250 women with various conditions, particularly in those associated with high CA 125 levels (endometriosis and other benign pelvic masses), serial samples from 25 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and a nested case control study of 172 UKCTOCS control arm participants which included serum samples up to two years before OC diagnosis. Results: The cell-free DNA amount and average fragment size in the serum samples was up to ten times higher than average published values (based on samples that were immediately processed) due to leakage of DNA from white blood cells owing to delayed time to serum separation. Despite this, the marker panel discriminated high grade serous OC patients from healthy women or patients with a benign pelvic mass with specificity/sensitivity of 90. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI][*]=[*] 84. 3 – 94. 8 %) and 41. 4 % (95 % CI[*]=[*] 24. 1 – 60. 9 %), respectively. Levels of all three markers plummeted after exposure to chemotherapy and correctly identified 78 % and 86 % responders and non-responders (Fisher's exact test, p[*]=[*] 0. 04), respectively, which was superior to a CA 125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL (20 % and 75 %). 57. 9 % (95 % CI 34. 0 – 78. 9 %) of women who developed OC within two years of sample collection were identified with a specificity of 88. 1 % (95 % CI[*]=[*] 77. 3 – 94. 3 %). Sensitivity and specificity improved further when specifically analyzing CA 125 negative samples only (63. 6 % and 87. 5 %, respectively). Conclusions: Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns in cell-free DNA have the potential to detect a proportion of OCs up to two years in advance of diagnosis and may potentially guide personalized treatment. The prospective use of novel collection vials, which stabilize blood cells and reduce background DNA contamination in serum/plasma samples, will facilitate clinical implementation of liquid biopsy analyses...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of the <b>myriad</b> of {{historic}} <b>attempts</b> to manage and/or restore degraded drylands offers a rich {{opportunity to learn}} from the past, particularly if conducted with full stakeholder engagement. Participatory environmental assessment of past land management and restoration actions would contribute to the improvement of future management techniques in a way relevant to the concerns of people involved with or impacted by these actions. This can also help to deal with the often scant information available, conflicting values and perceptions among stakeholders, and the uncertainties inherent to complex dryland systems. In this study I applied and evaluated a participatory protocol that incorporated multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools to assess five actions in the San Simon watershed, one of the most extreme examples of degradation and human intervention in southeastern Arizona (U. S.). The participatory assessment process included a semi-structured interview, elicitation of local-based assessment criteria, prioritization of the assessment criteria, estimation of data, a MCDA-based integration and group evaluation of final results. The process was used to evaluate five combinations of grazing management, vegetation management and hydraulic structures implemented between the 1940 s and 1980 s. The application of this process allowed me to not only evaluate these actions in a participatory way, but also to identify and compare values and perceptions connected to the historic, cultural and scientific narratives used by three different categories of stakeholders (researchers, practitioners and land users). The revised Simos' procedure used to elicit assessment criteria weights proved useful to expose values and perceptions, source of the individual criteria priorities, while revealing conflictive points of views among the stakeholders. The outranking-facilitated participatory assessment, when compared to the unaided baseline assessment, proved useful in making stakeholder preferences explicit in the form of evaluation criteria and weights, while incorporating data and uncertainty. The specific MCDA outranking integration model used, ELECTRE IS, proved to be simple and systematically synthetic, helping stakeholders structure and re-evaluate their unaided assessments. The results of this study provide insights in how stakeholders' knowledge and views can be elicited, explored and effectively incorporated to assess and learn from past land management and restoration actions implemented in drylands...|$|R
40|$|One methodological {{shortcoming}} of {{the contingent}} valuation method (CVM) {{is that it}} allows for both accidental and deliberate misreporting of individual preferences. In CVM surveys the preferences of people for an environmental improvement are measured in terms of their willingness to pay (WTP) to get that improvement or the project that yields it. The WTP respondents state in CVM interviews is interpreted as the monetary equivalent of the utility they expect from the environmental improvement in question. <b>Myriads</b> of <b>attempts</b> have been made to identify and eliminate those elements of a CVM survey which might induce respondents to deviate from stating their true willingness to pay in a CVM interview. Little attention has been paid, however, to the psychological characteristics of survey respondents, which may as well {{play an important role in}} this context. In particular, insights from modern personality psychological research which has already been applied in the recent decades in the field of behavioral economics have not been given much consideration in the context of environmental valuation. Therefore, this study scrutinizes the influence of personality traits on WTP statements from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Of special interest is the usefulness of personality traits for detecting biases in WTP answers. Personality traits are fundamental human dispositions, which influence peoples typical behavior, thoughts and feelings. In personality psychology today, it is commonly accepted that personality traits of human beings can be represented by five global personality domains, namely neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism represents the tendency of individuals to experience negative emotions, such as fear, sadness, embarrassment, and anger. Extraversion represents sociability, energeticness, and the tendency of individuals to experience positive emotions. Openness to experience represents the interest of individuals in the engagement with new experiences and impressions. Agreeableness incorporates the characteristics of empathy, cooperation, and care in interpersonal situations. Conscientiousness represents the tendency of being thorough, reliable, well-organized, and hard-working and hence describes the degree of self-control and purposefulness. These are the underlying concepts of the Big Five personality model (BFM) which forms the theoretical basis for this study. When it comes to the economic valuation of environmental goods, neuroticism and extraversion are suspected to distort respondents WTP statements. In this study the following hypotheses are analyzed: Neurotic respondents are expected to report WTP answers which are overshadowed by different sorts of negative emotions resulting in an understatement of their WTP answers. Respondents who score high on extraversion are expected to overstate their WTP responses in comparison to their true WTP because of their optimism and friendliness. Openness to experience and agreeableness, on the other hand, are not expected to cause biases contained in WTP answers. Yet, systematic relationships between the two personality domains and stated WTP are anticipated because these two domains are likely to be related to individual preferences for environmental projects. Positive association between openness to experience and stated WTP is expected because open individuals, who prefer novelty and are more ready to adopt new activities, may expect higher benefits from the project than respondents who score low on the openness scale. Agreeable respondents, who are fundamentally altruists, are expected to value environmental projects higher than respondents with a low level of agreeableness. As a consequence, a positive relationship between agreeableness and WTP answers is expected. Conscientiousness is not expected to influence stated WTP because the tendencies of being well-organized and hard-working appear to be not relevant to the economic valuation of environmental goods. The derived theoretical predictions of the influence of the five personality domains on stated WTP were verified in a practical CVM survey conducted in northern Thailand to assess the social benefits accruing to a lowland community in a watershed in Chiang Mai province from a project aiming at the improvement of their household water supply. The total of 570 personal interviews were conducted. Since the elicitation question format is generally suspected to influence CVM results, the sample was split to test the influence of personality in two elicitation question formats, namely the dichotomous choice elicitation format (DC) where respondents were asked if they would support the proposed project if they had to pay a surcharge of a specified amount on their water bill (N= 345), and the payment card format (PC) where respondents were asked to specify the payment interval from a given list that contains their WTP for the project (N= 225). In both splits, respondents were asked to complete the NEO-FFI, a 60 -item personality inventory designed to assess the five personality domains. Using factor analysis, five factors corresponding to the five personality domains emerged from the dataset indicating that the BFM can describe the personalities of the respondents in this study. However, it was found that that 20 items of the NEO-FFI worked poorly, hence they were excluded from further analysis. Results from probit and tobit regression models revealed a number of systematic relationships between the personality characteristics of CVM respondents and their responses to the WTP question. Openness to experience and conscientiousness exhibited a significantly positive effect on WTP statements for both question formats, whereas extraversion was significantly negatively related to WTP only in the PC format. Surprisingly, neuroticism and agreeableness did not have any effect on WTP responses. When it comes to the influence of the five domains on responses to other contingent valuation questions (socio-demographic household characteristics, lifestyle, general attitudes etc.), neuroticism showed a negative impact on stating extreme responses and a positive effect on protest beliefs. This means that respondents who score high on the neuroticism scale tended to select the middle response options of the Likert scales used in this context regardless of the content of the question. They are also likely to have a strong protest attitude towards the tap water improvement program in question than respondents who score low on the neuroticism scale. Extraversion showed a negative impact on response time, indicating that respondents who score high on extraversion tend to use less time to answer survey questions than low scorers. Conscientiousness displayed a positive influence on stating extreme responses, response time, and protest beliefs. No impact of openness to experience and agreeableness on contingent valuation survey responses was found. Taken together, these results suggest that the personality characteristics of the respondents as measured by the adjusted 40 -item NEO-FFI offer new insights into the psychological processes leading to systematic variations in WTP answers and other forms of contingent valuation survey responses. Such new insights give rise to a number of recommendations for further CVM surveys. ...|$|R
