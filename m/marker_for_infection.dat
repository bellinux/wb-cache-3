40|$|IP- 10 has {{potential}} as a diagnostic <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with comparable accuracy to QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-IT). The aims were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of IP- 10, and to evaluate the impact of co-morbidity on IP- 10 and QFT-IT. 168 cases with active TB, 101 healthy controls and 175 non-TB patients were included. IP- 10 and IFN-? were measured in plasma of QFT-IT stimulated whole blood and analyzed using previously determined algorithms. A subgroup of 48 patients and 70 healthy controls was tested in parallel with T-SPOT. TB IP- 10 and QFT-IT had comparable accuracy. Sensitivity was 81 % and 84 % with a specificity of 97 % and 100 %, respectively. Combining IP- 10 and QFT-IT improved sensitivity to 87 % (p < 0. 0005), with a specificity of 97 %. T-SPOT. TB was more sensitive than QFT-IT, but not IP- 10. Among non-TB patients IP- 10 had {{a higher rate of}} positive responders (35 % vs 27 %, p < 0. 02) and for both tests a positive response was associated with relevant risk factors. IFN-? but not IP- 10 responses to mitogen stimulation were reduced in patients with TB and non-TB infection. This study confirms and validates previous findings and adds substance to IP- 10 as a novel diagnostic <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> with M. tuberculosis.

40|$|Virus from HT- 1080 {{fibrosarcoma}} cells {{infected with}} the human retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) can induce rare foci of transformation in rat 208 F fibroblasts. Characterization of three such foci revealed that one produced an acutely transforming virus at a high titer. The virus consists of a mutant Nras cDNA from the HT- 1080 cells inserted into a retroviral vector (added to the HT- 1080 cells as a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection)</b> in place of internal vector sequences.

40|$|Available {{diagnostic}} assays for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) have poor sensitivities and cannot detect {{early stages}} of infection, therefore, there is need to find new diagnostic <b>markers</b> <b>for</b> early <b>infection</b> detection and disease stages.

We used both statistical methods and dynamic mathematical models to (i) evaluate the empirical assays (ii) infer and explain biological mechanisms that affect the time evolution of the biomarkers, and (iii) predict disease stages of 57 animals that were naturally infected with MAP. This analysis confirms that the fecal test is the best <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> disease progression and illustrates that Th 1 /Th 2 (IFN-γ/ELISA antibodies) assays are important <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> detection, but cannot reliably predict persistent infections.

40|$|Vertebral lesions {{have been}} the main {{evidence}} <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) in paleopathology. Skeletal involvement is expected in {{a small percentage of}} infected individuals. Recently, several authors report a correlation between rib lesions and tuberculosis (TB) complex infection. This study tests the hypothesis that rib lesions can serve as a useful <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> MTC <b>infection</b> within the Mississippian Schild skeletal collection from West-Central Illinois. Ribs from 221 adults and juveniles were examined, and affected individuals were tested <b>for</b> TB complex <b>infection.</b> DNA from rib samples of affected individuals was amplified with primers targeting the IS 6110 insertion element, which is common to all members of the TB complex. Although it cannot allow discrimination between different species of TB, IS 6110 is present in many copies within their genomes, and its presence is thus an indication of MTC infection. The results support the use of rib lesions as a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> TB <b>infection.</b> Additionally, we demonstrate that MTC DNA can be recovered from ribs that lack lesions in individuals who have lesions of other bones. We recommend that an examination of ribs be incorporated into investigations for TB...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of a prosthetic joint infection is difficult, but crucial for appropriate treatment. Scintigraphy with specific <b>markers</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> (labelled white cells or immunoglobulin-G) has been reported as a more reliable diagnostic tool than clinical assessment (fever, fistula), laboratory studies (polynuclear neutrophil count, erythrocyte rate sedimentation, and C-reactive protein), and preoperative aspiration. In {{the first part of}} this study, we retrospectively reviewed 230 patients admitted with a suspected prosthetic joint infection, and examined the validity of the different diagnostic tools for the group as a whole and for subgroups according to the Coventry classification.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) within the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene are associated with small vessel vasculitis (SVV) and are {{a risk factor for}} intercurrent infection, as described previously in other autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Six SNPs in the MBL promoter and coding region were genotyped by sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction or restriction fragment length polymorphism assay in 170 white Caucasians with SVV and 372 ethnically matched controls in a case-control association study. Serum MBL levels were measured by ELISA. The genotype and protein concentrations were correlated to clinical details retrieved from hospital records. RESULTS: No differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies were detected between patients with SVV and control subjects. MBL deficiency did not increase the susceptibility to infection (P = 0. 6, Fisher's exact test) or the duration of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MBL polymorphisms are not associated with SVV and do not influence the incidence of concomitant infections. These results raise doubts about the usefulness of MBL polymorphisms as a predictive <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> in SVV...|$|E

40|$|The kinetoplastid {{membrane}} protein 11 (KMP- 11) has been recently described in Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani {{as a major}} component of the promastigote membrane. Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to PCR-amplify the entire coding region of New World Leishmania species. The Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis amplification product was cloned, sequenced and the putative amino acid sequence determined. A remarkably high degree of sequence homology was observed with the corresponding molecule of L. (L) donovani and L. (L) infantum (97 % and 96 %, respectively). Southern blot analysis showed that the KMP- 11 locus is conformed by three copies of the gene. The L. (V) panamensis ORF was subsequently cloned in a high expression vector and the recombinant protein was induced and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. Immunoblot analysis showed that 80 %, 77 % and 100 % sera from cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis patients, respectively, recognized the recombinant KMP- 11 protein. In a similar assay, 86 % of asymptomatic Leishmania-infected individuals showed IgG antibodies against the rKMP- 11.

40|$|Infection {{frequently}} causes exacerbations {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition receptor that assists in clearing microorganisms. Polymorphisms in the MBL 2 gene reduce serum MBL levels and {{are associated with}} risk of infection. We studied whether the MBL 2 codon 54 B allele affected serum MBL levels, admissions for infective exacerbation in COPD and disease susceptibility. Polymorphism frequency was determined by PCR-RFLP in 200 COPD patients and 104 smokers with normal lung function. Serum MBL was measured as mannan-binding activity in a subgroup of 82 stable COPD patients. Frequency of COPD admissions for infective exacerbation was ascertained for a 2 -year period. The MBL 2 codon 54 B allele reduced serum MBL in COPD patients. In keeping, patients carrying the low MBL-producing B allele had increased risk of admission for infective exacerbation (OR 4. 9, P-corrected = 0. 011). No association of MBL 2 genotype with susceptibility to COPD was detected. In COPD, serum MBL is regulated by polymorphism at codon 54 in its encoding gene. Low MBL-producing genotypes were associated with more frequent admissions to hospital with respiratory infection, suggesting that the MBL 2 gene is disease-modifying in COPD. MBL 2 genotype should be explored prospectively as a prognostic <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> risk in COPD...|$|E

The original assessment of the inability of gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors to infect growth-arrested cells was carried out using established cell lines that had been growth-arrested by chemical means, and has been generalized to neurons, which are post-mitotic. We re-examined the capability of gammaretroviruses and their derived vectors to efficiently infect terminally differentiated neuroendocrine cells and primary cortical neurons, a target of both experimental and therapeutic interest.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is {{commonly}} used as a marker for inflammatory states and for early identification of infection. This study aimed to investigate CRP as a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> in patients with postoperative septic shock. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, single-center study, developed in a surgical intensive care unit at Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo. METHODS: This study evaluated 54 patients in the postoperative period, of whom 29 had septic shock (SS group) and 25 had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS group). All of the patients were monitored over a seven-day period using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and daily CRP and lactate measurements. RESULTS: The daily CRP measurements did not differ between the groups. There was no correlation between CRP and lactate levels and the SOFA score in the groups. We observed that the plasma CRP concentrations were high in {{almost all of the}} patients. The patients presented an inflammatory state postoperatively in response to surgical aggression. This could explain the elevated CRP measurements, regardless of whether the patient was infected or not. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show any correlation between CRP and infection among patients with SIRS and septic shock during the early postoperative period...|$|E
40|$|Several {{diagnostic}} hepatitis C assays {{have been}} developed for the detection of antibodies to different antigens of the virus. This virus is the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Seventy-nine patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration were tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies (anti-C- 100 - 3 antibodies and anti-core antibodies), anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), and aminotransferases (ALT). Seven patients were positive by {{one or more of the}} anti-HCV enzyme linked immunoassays (EIAs), while HCV-RNA was detectable in only four patients. These four patients had at least one, but not necessarily the same, positive anti-HCV EIA. HCV-RNA was not detected in patients who had no antibodies as determined by all six anti-HCV EIAs. All patients with a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> HCV <b>infection</b> had persistent normal levels of transaminases.

Disease was tracked in a CWD-endemic herd using serial tonsillar biopsies collected at 6 to 9 month intervals from 34 captive mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and five white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). Tonsillar biopsies were examined for accumulation of PrPCWD, the protein <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection,</b> using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. 26 / 34 (76 %) mule deer and 4 / 5 (80 %) white-tailed deer had PrPCWD accumulation in tonsillar biopsies; CWD was subsequently confirmed by post-mortem examination in all 30 of these tonsillar-positive deer. Six mule deer with IHC-negative tonsillar biopsies had positive brain and tonsillar IHC staining upon death 12 to 40 months following the last biopsy. PrPCWD accumulation in tonsillar biopsy was observed 2 to 20 months before CWDrelated death and up to 14 months before onset of clinical signs of CWD. Tonsillar biopsies from 3 -month-old mule deer (n= 6) were IHC negative, but PrPCWD accumulation was detected in tonsillar biopsies from 7 / 10 mule deer by 19 months of age.

To detect gastric urease, we examined 32 patients who were being evaluated for possible peptic ulcer disease. Fasting patients were given 10 /Â¿Ci(370 kBq) of 14 C-labeled urea. Breath samples were collected in hyamine at intervals between 1 and 30 min. The amount of 14 Ccollected at these times was expressed as: body weight x (% of administered dose of 14 Cin sample) /(mmol of CO 2 collected). The presence of C. pylori colonization was also determined by examination of multiple endoscopie gastric biopsy specimens. On average, patients who were proven to have C. pylori infection exhaled 20 times more labeled CO 2 than patients who were not infected. The difference between infected patients and C. pylori negative "control " patients was highly significant at all time points between 2 and 30 min after ingestion of the radionuclide (p < 0. 0001). The noninvasive urea breath is less expensive than endoscopie biopsy of the stomach and more accurate than serology {{as a means of}} detecting Campylobacter pylori infection.

40|$|Although {{treatment}} of medulloblastoma has improved, at least 30 % {{of patients with}} this tumor die of progressive disease. Unfortunately, {{many of the children}} who survive suffer long-term treatment-related morbidity. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using oncolytic viruses to eradicate brain tumors. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the efficacy of measles virus in treating medulloblastoma. To determine whether medulloblastoma cells are susceptible, 5 different human medulloblastoma cell lines were analyzed for the expression of the measles virus receptor CD 46. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis confirmed expression of CD 46 on all cell lines tested, with UW 288 - 1 having the most prominent expression and D 283 med displaying the lowest expression. CD 46 expression was also demonstrated, using immunohistochemistry, in 13 of 13 medulloblastoma tissue specimens. All 5 medulloblastoma cell lines were examined for their susceptibility to measles virus killing in vitro. A measles virus containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> (MV-GFP) was used. All cell lines exhibited significant killing when infected with MV-GFP, all formed syncytia with infection, all showed fluorescence, and all allowed viral replicaton after infection. In an intracerebral murine xenograft model, a statistically significant increase in survival was seen in animals treated with the active measles virus compared with those treated with inactivated virus. These data demonstrate that medulloblastoma is susceptible to measles virus killing and that the virus may have a role in treating this tumor in the clinical setting...|$|E

40|$|The {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies are {{a heterogeneous}} group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders occurring in humans, mink, cats, and ruminant herbivores. The occurrence of novel {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} in cattle in the United Kingdom and Europe and in mule deer and elk {{in parts of the}} United States has emphasized the need for reliable diagnostic tests with standardized reagents. Postmortem diagnosis is performed by histologic examination of brain sections from affected animals. The histopathological criteria for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies include gliosis, astrocytosis, neuronal degeneration, and spongiform change. These lesions vary in intensity and anatomic location depending on the host species and genetics, stage of disease, and infectious agent source. Diagnosis by histopathology alone may be ambiguous in hosts with early cases of disease and impossible if the tissue is autolyzed. Deposition of the prion protein (an abnormal isoform of a native cellular sialoglycoprotein) in the central nervous system is a reliable <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection,</b> and immunohistochemical detection of this marker is a useful adjunct to histopathology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During inflammation, the serum {{concentrations}} of {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (G-CSF), plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) increase. A positive correlation between CRP and the percentages of neutrophils exhibiting toxic granulation during inflammation has been demonstrated, and that the fluctuations of CRP and toxic granulation of neutrophils were similar. OBJECTIVES: We studied whether grading of toxic granulated neutrophils {{can be used as}} a surrogate <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> or inflammation, and also be an easier method than previously described methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We graded 357 consecutive peripheral blood slides from patients on whom a full blood count with differential count and CRP level was performed, according to intensity of toxic granulation in the neutrophil population, according to a newly proposed grading system. RESULTS: The CRP range was between 1 and 530. 3 mg/l. The results confirm the association between a rise in CRP and progressive intensity of toxic granulation in neutrophils in peripheral blood. Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations rank test showed a statistically significant difference between the graded categories (p= 0. 0001). The Trend test was also statistically significant (p= 0. 000). CONCLUSION: The proposed system can be applied to patients with inflammatory or infectious conditions, where grading of toxic granulation of neutrophils can possibly be used as a surrogate marker to assess infection or inflammation and their response to treatment. It may be of particular use in cases where traditional infectious or inflammatory markers cannot be used, owing to inherent problems associated with the respective conditions...|$|E
40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi {{expresses a}} conserved, species-specific 39 -kDa protein (P 39) that can stimulate {{antibodies}} during human infection. To confirm that anti-P 39 antibodies are produced consistently in animals exposed to infectious spirochetes, white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and laboratory white mice, Mus musculus (strain BALB/c), were experimentally inoculated with either infectious or noninfectious B. burgdorferi and the antibody response to P 39 {{was determined by}} immunoblot at 21 days postinoculation. All mice inoculated with approximately 10 (7) infectious B. burgdorferi produced anti-P 39 antibodies and were cultured positive for this spirochete. Mice inoculated with similar numbers of inactivated or viable noninfectious B. burgdorferi still producing P 39 did not induce anti-P 39 antibodies. By contrast, putative antiflagellin antibodies were detected in less than 18 % of the infected animals, which supports the notion that antibody reactive with flagellin may not be reliable as a <b>marker</b> <b>for</b> B. burgdorferi exposure as was originally thought. Mice infected with B. burgdorferi following exposure to ticks (Ixodes dammini) produced anti-P 39 antibodies no later than 7 days postinfection, indicating that P 39 is an effective immunogen in natural infections. Notably, anti-P 39 antibodies were the predominant B. burgdorferi reactive antibodies detected early in the infection. Our results indicate that anti-P 39 antibodies are produced {{in response to an}} active infection and are therefore reliable <b>markers</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> in experimentally and naturally inoculated animals...|$|R
40|$|The sera from 12 {{consecutive}} symptomatic {{women with}} laparoscopy-confirmed salpingitis were screened {{for the presence}} of specific IgG and IgA antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis by a single antigen (L- 2) immunoperoxidase assay. All women were found to have IgG and IgA antibodies to C trachomatis. Six women had positive endocervical cultures for C trachomatis, and one of these had positive cultures from the conjunctiva and fallopian tubes. Serum chlamydial IgA antibodies may serve as <b>markers</b> <b>for</b> active <b>infection</b> with C trachomatis regardless of whether organisms can be identified by culture or direct fluorescent antibody techniques from endocervical or fallopian tube samples...|$|R
40|$|So far, {{there have}} been few {{previous}} reports of tuberculous spondylitis occurring after percutaneous vertebroplasty. We report an unusual case of tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed after percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient who had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis for the first time. A 58 -year-old woman, who had a history of complete recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis six years previously, was hospitalized due to severe back pain after a fall. Radiological studies revealed a fresh compression fracture at the T 12 thoracic vertebra. The back pain improved dramatically, and the patient was discharged two days after the vertebroplasty. However, cold sweats and a low grade fever with severe back pain developed four weeks after the procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a severe kyphosis and the T 11 -T 12 disc space had collapsed with heterogeneous signal intensity. The results of the culture of the biopsy specimens were negative, and did not lead to identification of the causative micro-organism. However, the polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive. Treatment for tuberculous spondylitis was started and she underwent posterior fusion and instrumentation from T 9 -L 2 after the <b>markers</b> <b>for</b> <b>infection</b> returned to normal. After surgical intervention, the pain improved and the kyphotic deformity was corrected...|$|R
