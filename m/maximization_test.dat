The hallmark of meaningful scientific investigation isreproducibility. While animal and human methodology for allergen investigation generally gives reproducible results, clinical correlation is occasionally absent. Irritants are more problematic. At times, irritant esting varies widely {{and appears to}} defy scientific method. Several reasons for this variability will be explored in this study.

We have so far reported threshold values of chemi-cal allergens for both induction and challenge phases in the modified guinea pig <b>maximization</b> <b>test</b> (GPMT). In this study, we examined N-(1 -methylheptyl) -N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (MHPPD), an antioxidant for rubber prod-ucts, and 2 -(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole (TCMTB), a biocide for plastic and wood products. MHPPD and TCMTB exhibited distinct profiles of contact allergenicity with the GPMT; that is, both could sensitize guinea pigs by the second induction procedure of topical application alone, even without the first induction procedure of intra-dermal injection. The calculated challenge threshold values for MHPPD and TCMTB were 0. 9 and 0. 8 ppm, respectively, which were at least one tenth {{lower than those of}} chemical allergens previously examined by us. Octanol-water partition coefficients (log p) used as an index of skin permeability were not necessarily higher for MHPPD and TCMTB than those of other allergens, thus, the skin permeability of these compounds {{did not seem to be}} related to their ability to cause sensitization by topical application alone or their low challenge threshold values.

The latter epoxy resins contain three isomers of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (DGEBF). PGE, DGEBA, and DGEBF are chemically similar {{with respect to}} the reactive glycidyl group and an aromatic ring, making cross-reactivity one of the possible explanations to simultaneous reactions.

METHOD: The guinea-pig <b>maximization</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: PGE is a strong sensitizer. Induction with DGEBA resulted in a statistically significant number of animals reacting to PGE, but when induced with PGE, the animals did not react significantly to DGEBA.

40|$|The human organotypic skin explant culture (hOSEC) {{model is}} a {{promising}} alternative in vitro model for screening contact allergens. In this model, the chemical-induced migration of Langerhans cells (LCs) out of the epidermis, evaluated after a 24 -h exposure period, {{is used as a}} measure of sensitizer potential. As skin irritants can also induce LC migration it is essential that concentrations of test chemicals are used that are not even weakly irritant. Using the hOSEC irritation model chemicals are classified as weak irritants if they are toxic after a 48 -h exposure period. Toxicity is determined by methyl green-pyronine (MGP) staining of hOSEC. We studied three frequently used non-sensitizing skin irritants and six potent or frequent human sensitizers in a dose-response. A complete discrimination between non-sensitizers and contact sensitizers was obtained for the chemicals tested when the concentrations used were lower than the weak irritant concentrations. Frequency of positive allergen reactions in patch test of human populations correlated with the difference between weak irritant concentrations and the lowest concentration inducing significant LC migration. Sensitizer potency correlated with chemical irritancy as determined by keratinocyte death.

40|$|Dose–response {{profiles}} {{for both}} induction and elicitation phases were evaluated with seven chemical aller-gens using the guinea pig <b>maximization</b> <b>test.</b> Considering the risk assessment of contact sensitization in its practi-cal sense, {{the profile of}} elicitation would be more critical than that of induction, {{and it should be}} evaluated in a maximally induced human population or experimental animals. When mean skin reaction scores in a group of maximally sensitized animals with each allergen were plotted against log challenge concentrations, linear regres-sion lines with good fitness were adapted to all allergens. An elicitation threshold calculated from the linear regres-sion line of each allergen could be used as an index of the relative elicitation potency of a chemical. However, unlike other cases of risk assessment, maximum acceptable concentrations for allergens in consumer products cannot be obtained simply by dividing an elicitation threshold by a fixed safety factor. The value of a safety factor for each allergen should be set on a case by case basis. As a practical matter, consumers are at a risk of exposure to allergens at concentrations greater than elicitation thresholds. Thus a dose–response profile for elicitation in maxi-mally sensitized animals {{should be included in the}} evaluation of the risk. We propose to use the area under the linear regression line between the threshold and 1 % of the elicitation concentration as a relative elicitation potency index of each allergen, because it reflects the integrated degree of skin reaction that would emerge among a maxi-mally sensitized population exposed to an allergen.

For each zone, the volume of all incoming and outgoing traffic is counted on a regular basis but no information about the origin or destination of the observed traffic is used. We suggest procedures for a regular update of estimates of the N(N− 1) mean traffic demands between the zones on the basis of an incoming stream of the 2 N traffic counts. The procedures are based on an exponential smoothing scheme and are reminiscent of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm if smoothing is removed. Fast and reliable numerical algorithms, based on the con-jugate gradient method, are presented for normal as well as for Poisson traffic de-mands. The Poisson case is linked with entropy <b>maximization.</b> Computational <b>tests</b> based on simulated data demonstrate both the numerical and statistical efficiency of the procedures...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{geometric}} approach to 3 -D motion segmentation from point correspondences in three perspective views. We demonstrate that after applying a polynomial embedding to the correspondences they become related by the so-called multibody trilinear constraint {{and its associated}} multibody trifocal tensor T. We first show how to linearly estimate T from point-point-point correspondences. Given T, we show that the derivatives of the multibody trilinear constraint at a correspondence enable us to transfer points and lines from two views to the other. We then show that one can estimate the epipolar lines associated with each image point from the common root {{of a set of}} univariate polynomials, and the epipoles by solving a plane clustering problem in R 3. The individual trifocal tensors are then obtained from the second order derivatives of the multibody trilinear constraint. Given epipolar lines and epipoles, or trifocal tensors, one can immediately obtain an initial clustering of the correspondences. We use this initial clustering to initialize an iterative algorithm that finds an optimal estimate for the trifocal tensors and the segmentation of the correspondences using Expectation <b>Maximization.</b> We <b>test</b> our algorithm on various real and synthetic dynamic scenes. 1...|$|R
40|$|We develop {{tests of}} {{financial}} intermediation by national banking systems that exploit regional financial and economic data. Derived from {{a model of}} bank profit <b>maximization,</b> the <b>tests</b> {{are based on the}} expectation that in efficient systems, financial intermediation should not be overly influenced by policy variables; should be greater where projects are more profitable and require greater financing - typically in faster growing, richer, industrial areas; and should direct funds to the best projects regardless of where deposits originate. We apply these tests to Chinese provincial data from 1991 - 97 for all state banks, the Agricultural Bank of China, rural credit cooperatives, and other financial institutions. China implemented a series of widely publicized financial reforms in the mid- 1990 s designed to improve bank performance. However, descriptive and estimation results suggest that the importance of state bank policy lending (to support SOEs and finance agricultural procurement) has increased, not fallen, during the recent period, and lending does not respond to economic fundamentals. Only the group of smaller, less-regulated financial institutions appear commercially oriented. Despite reforms, significant barriers to efficient inter-regional financial intermediation remain. ...|$|R
