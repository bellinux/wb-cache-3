50|$|Many of {{the criticisms}} {{directed}} towards military simulations derive from an incorrect application {{of them as a}} predictive and analytical tool. The outcome supplied by a model relies {{to a greater or lesser}} extent on human interpretation and therefore should not be regarded as providing a 'gospel' truth. However, whilst this is generally understood by most game theorists and analysts, it can be tempting for a layman—for example, a politician who needs to present a 'black and white' situation to his electorate—to settle on an interpretation that supports his preconceived position. Tom Clancy, in his novel Red Storm Rising, illustrated this problem when one of his characters, attempting to persuade the Soviet Politburo that the political risks were acceptable as NATO would not be in a position to react in the face of political uncertainty caused by a division of opinion between the Allies, used a political wargame result as evidence the results of a simulation carried out to model just such an event. It is revealed in the text that there were in fact three sets of results from the simulation; a best-, intermediate- and worst-case outcome. The advocate of war chose to present only the best-case outcome, thus distorting the results to support his case. Although fictional, the above scenario may however have been based on fact. The Japanese extensively wargamed their planned expansion during World War II, but map exercises conducted before the Pacific War were frequently stopped short of a conclusion where Japan was defeated. One often-cited example prior to Midway had the umpires magically resurrecting a Japanese carrier sunk during a <b>map</b> <b>exercise,</b> although Professor Robert Rubel argues in the Naval War College Review their decision was justified in this case given improbable rolls of the dice. Given the historical outcome, it is evident the dice rolls were not so improbable, after all. There were however equally illustrative fundamental problems with other areas of the simulation, mainly relating to a Japanese unwillingness to consider their position should the element of surprise, on which the operation depended, be lost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} three years, we have been {{studying}} how automated evaluation of student mind maps (when compared to an expert map) shows student learning for a variety of metrics. The goal of this work is to build a system that would then allow students to evaluate their understanding of the terminology in a respective field. The weakness of our studies, so far, is that our focus group to study these metrics consists of a single course in the field of Computer Engineering, and though this class has been used over multiple years to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a longitudinal study, a broader study needs to be done. In this work, we show how our current metrics perform across three additional fields; specifically, we have collaborated with instructors in speech pathology, communications, and po-litical science (in addition to our traditional class in computer engineering). We then use our methodology to determine if these courses and a term long mind <b>map</b> <b>exercise</b> have similar results than previously reported and are these results evidence of student learning. Our results show that our existing metrics have similar results for one of the three new courses. However, in the two other courses, the data shows no evidence of learning based on the mind <b>map</b> <b>exercise.</b> Each of the instructors of these courses describes their experience with the activity. Additionally, we evaluate the construction of the expert maps in each course to understand if there is a graph-based structural reason why we the results might be different.

40|$|Background: Optimal {{adherence}} to HIV medications {{is imperative to}} prevent AIDS related deaths, the development of opportunistic infections, and drug resistant strains of HIV. African American women {{are less likely to}} maintain optimal {{adherence to}} HIV medications compared to White and Latina women. Adherence is a complex, multi-faceted and dynamic behavior. Understanding correlates of adherence is necessary for the development of interventions aimed at promoting adherence. Objective: To describe the internal models of HIV and examine predictors of adherence in African American women living with HIV. Methods: In this descriptive cross sectional study, African American {{women between the ages of}} 18 - 60 who were living with HIV (N= 110) were recruited from an HIV clinic in central Minnesota. The Conceptual Content Cognitive <b>Map</b> <b>exercise</b> and surveys were used to assess the women’s HIV internal models and HIV knowledge, directed attention, spiritual well-being, mattering to others, sense of belonging, depressive symptoms, drug and alcohol use and adherence. Results: The Conceptual Content Cognitive <b>Map</b> <b>exercise</b> revealed that the women believed taking medication, family, children, church and God were positive aspects of their lives living with HIV. Linear regression models were not significant (p =. 069) when all study variables were regressed on adherence. The adherence variable was dichotomized in several ways. When adherence was dichotomized into 0 - 99 and 100 scores, the model was significant (p =. 004). Findings indicate that women who scored higher on depressive symptoms and directed attention (as measured by digit span backwards) and had less feeling like they mattered to others were less likely to maintain complete adherence. Conclusions: Self-reported adherence scores had limited variability and resulted in the study being underpowered. Women had largely positive internal models of HIV, which could partially explain the limited variability in adherence. Future research should utilize different measures for predictor variables that are more in align with the theoretical underpinnings of the framework utilized like exposure to natural environments instead of spiritual well being as a measure of restoration for directed attention. Virologic HIV RNA should be coupled with any self-report adherence measure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This {{preliminary}} study examines {{the application of}} contemporary practice-based approaches to generate data for guiding the design of information literacy learning environments. Method. This study was conducted by interviewing three engineering students who were participating at the Tools for master’s thesis course arranged by Aalto University Library’s Otaniemi Campus Library. The interview’s structure was two-fold, as it first sketched out the participant’s master’s thesis practices through Schatzki’s site ontology and secondly examined the perceived value of different information literacy learning tasks on the latter. Results. The master’s thesis practices of the interviewees were networked in complex ways with e. g. economic life and the interviewees invested much in them. Two of the interviewees worked with their thesis full-time with surroundings and tools provided by their employer. The interviewees valued most the lecture, which comprised of narratives of completed master’s thesis projects and the lecture of scientific writing. From the asynchronous online learning tasks, the interviewees valued most the information retrieval task and the concept <b>map</b> <b>exercise.</b> Conclusion.
