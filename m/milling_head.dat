50|$|The {{original}} corporation {{was founded}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut and started selling its machines in 1938. It became famous in the following decades for these small- and medium-sized vertical milling machines, with their iconic form of a quill-equipped multiple-speed vertical <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> with a ram-on-turret mounting over a knee-and-column base. The American Precision Museum's biography of Rudolph Bannow reports that he conceived the iconic design in 1936 as the logical machine on which to mount the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> already being built by the Bridgeport Pattern and Model Works (which he owned with partner Magnus Wahlstrom). The first Bridgeport milling machine (serial number 1) is {{on display at the}} Museum.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the conical mill was created in 1976 by the {{engineers}} of Quadro Engineering, who remains the foremost manufacturer of conical mills. Conical mills are available in Ex- execution {{with a variety of}} sieves and impellers. The <b>mill</b> <b>head</b> can be mounted on a mobile lifter which allows for easy up and down movement for docking into containers, tablet presses and others. The <b>mill</b> <b>head</b> is dismounted from a lifter for easy cleaning.|$|R
50|$|For the X and Y-axis {{drive systems}} most PCB milling {{machines}} use stepper motors that drive a precision lead screw. The lead screw is in turn {{linked to the}} gantry or <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> by a special precision machined connection assembly. To maintain correct alignment during milling, the gantry or milling head's direction of travel is guided along using linear or dovetailed bearing(s). Most X/Y drive systems provide user control, via software, of the milling speed, which determines how fast the stepper motors drive their respective axes.|$|E
50|$|Z-axis {{drive and}} control are handled in several ways. The {{first and most}} common is a simple solenoid that pushes against a spring. When the solenoid is {{energized}} it pushes the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> down against a spring stop that limits the downward travel. The rate of descent {{as well as the}} amount of force exerted on the spring stop must be manually set by mechanically adjusting the position of the solenoid's plunger. The second type of Z-axis control is {{through the use of a}} pneumatic cylinder and a software-driven gate valve. Due to the small cylinder size and the amount of air pressure used to drive it there is little range of control between the up and down stops. Both the solenoid and pneumatic system cannot position the head anywhere other than the endpoints, and are therefore useful for only simple 'up/down' milling tasks. The final type of Z-axis control uses a stepper motor that allows the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> to be moved in small accurate steps up or down. Further, the speed of these steps can be adjusted to allow tool bits to be eased into the board material rather than hammered into it. The depth (number of steps required) as well as the downward/upward speed is under user control via the controlling software.|$|E
50|$|The {{meeting with}} Bannow {{was the start}} of a {{successful}} partnership. The two began by producing electric hedge clippers. After much hard work, their first universal milling machine was built in 1932. By 1936, their company was called the Bridgeport Pattern and Model Works and was offering milling heads (the part of a mill where the spindle is) commercially. The American Precision Museum's biography of Rudolph Bannow reports that he conceived the iconic Bridgeport ram-and-turret, knee-and-column design in 1936 as the logical machine on which to mount the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> already being built by the company. In 1938 they began selling whole milling machines. The company had now established itself as a machine tool builder named Bridgeport Machines, Inc. After getting into this business line, the company started to become very successful.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem was}} {{printing}} the diagrams. GM solved {{this problem by}} using an approach developed by Boeing, replacing the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> of a computerized milling machine with a ball-point pen and connecting the inputs of the mill to the 704 computer. To address the extremely limited amount of memory available on the 704, they broke the diagrams down into 32-by-32-inch squares, which could be plotted with enough accuracy {{that they could be}} loaded up as separate tiles and still line up perfectly when plotted as part of complete diagrams. A set of rollers were added to allow the plotter to move a single 96 in piece of paper around the drawing surface on demand, meaning that the paper {{did not have to be}} cut into pieces. The paper was delivered in rolls, allowing diagrams to be any length.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of control {{technologies}} such as numerical control (NC and CNC) and programmable logic control (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a milling machine could not have their contours mapped out by moving the milling cutter in a [...] "connect-the-dots" [...] ("by-the-numbers") fashion. The only ways to control {{the movement of the}} cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human's accuracy and precision) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the tracing stylus. If the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a tool and die maker using toolroom methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with files and/or die grinder points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the machining of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph routing, which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a copying lathe developed by Thomas Blanchard, used the same essential concept.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanics}} {{behind a}} PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward {{and have their}} roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system {{is similar to a}} miniature and highly accurate NC milling table. For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel port connection to the milling machine's on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. [...] Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide positional feedback. More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machine tool is the {{foundation}} of manufacture，then, five-axis CNC machine is the sophisticated equipment of CNC machine. During the practical work ， there is an thermal deformation in a CNC machine because of many kinds of heat sources. This deformation affects the relative displacement between the work piece and the cutter, caused the manufacturing errors, and influences the machining accuracy of the part. So is of great importance to research the thermal characteristics. In this paper, thermal characteristics of CNC milling machine are simulated by analyzing the thermal boundary condition and using the finite element software-ANASYS Workbench.

50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small drill press, but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized drill press, with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a drill press {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a drill press motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a drill press may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as drill press, where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed <b>milling</b> <b>head,</b> and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|E

50|$|One is an {{adaptation}} of the method used with the Drift Sight. Prior to approaching the target, the bomb aimer would have the pilot turn onto the expected wind line, and dials in zero wind speed and due north wind direction, which points the drift bar straight forward. With the bar in this position, the bomb aimer uses the drift wires to tune out any sideways drift and thereby find the exact wind direction. The bearing plate is rotated to the compass heading and locked, thereby recording the wind direction for future reference. The pilot then turned 90 degrees to {{one side or the}} other, placing the wind directly {{off the side of the}} aircraft. The bomb aimer then rotated the <b>milled</b> <b>head</b> to the same 90 degrees. At this point the wind speed knob is adjusted, pushing the drift bar sideways until objects on the ground could be seen moving directly along the drift wires. The wind speed is now known and set, and the aircraft can then manoeuvre as it wants with only the <b>milled</b> <b>head</b> needing adjustment.|$|R
