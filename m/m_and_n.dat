5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers <b>m</b> <b>and</b> <b>n</b> must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of <b>m</b> <b>and</b> <b>n</b> to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E

We could perhaps attempt to define such a jet by using local coordinates on <b>M</b> <b>and</b> <b>N.</b> The disadvantage {{of this is that}} jets cannot thus be defined in an equivariant fashion.

25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{consonant}} clusters can occur in Crow. All consonants except for /h/ can be geminated. Voiced labials and dentals (phonemic <b>m</b> <b>and</b> <b>n,</b> allophones b, m, w and d, n, l) are resistant to clustering. Because they only occur intervocallically, l and w do not occur in clusters. The plosive allophones b and d only occur in clusters as the second consonant and only at morpheme boundaries. The nasal allophones <b>m</b> <b>and</b> <b>n</b> can only occur with each other {{with the exception of}} nm, or occur with h at a morpheme boundary.
