5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their <b>moral</b> judgements. This often occurs in <b>moral</b> dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in <b>moral</b> reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of <b>moral</b> reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a <b>moral</b> dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in <b>moral</b> reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make <b>moral</b> decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the <b>moral</b> worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic <b>moral</b> worth because they cannot make a <b>moral</b> judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's <b>moral</b> worth is determined by its ability to make a <b>moral</b> judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of <b>moral</b> thought as being equally undue <b>moral</b> consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the <b>Moral</b> Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses <b>moral</b> dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of <b>moral</b> reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a <b>moral</b> decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple <b>moral</b> dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that <b>moral</b> action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make <b>moral</b> judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; <b>moral</b> reasoning may be less relevant to <b>moral</b> action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E
5|$|Some {{arguments}} from <b>moral</b> order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} <b>moral</b> order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of <b>moral</b> order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} <b>moral</b> order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and <b>moral</b> virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and <b>moral</b> virtue is only possible if a natural <b>moral</b> order exists. A natural <b>moral</b> order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on <b>moral</b> normativity or <b>moral</b> order. Arguments from <b>moral</b> normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from <b>moral</b> order are based on the asserted need for <b>moral</b> order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this <b>moral</b> order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of <b>moral</b> good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of <b>moral</b> evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of <b>moral</b> evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of <b>moral</b> evil only by removing the possibility of <b>moral</b> good.|$|E

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of <b>moral</b> reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a <b>moral</b> dilemma and finding their current level of <b>moral</b> reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind <b>moral</b> development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a <b>moral</b> patient—one due <b>moral</b> consideration—he believed that animals have no <b>moral</b> rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to <b>moral</b> scepticism or antirealism.

Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective <b>moral</b> truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E

It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created <b>moral</b> truths.
