These Early Cretaceous beds constitute {{the lower part}} of the Yixian Formation, which is dated at 124.6 million years old. Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{occurs at}} a lower rate across <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> low thermal conductivity than across <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> high thermal conductivity. Correspondingly, <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications and <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The thermal conductivity <b>of</b> a <b>material</b> may depend on temperature. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity.|$|R

40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{teaching}} of semantics, many semantics teachers find difficulty in deciding what to teach in their semantics classes. They have the opinion that concepts such as connotative meaning, social meaning, affective meaning, collocative meaning, thematic meaning, meaning changes of words, synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, harmonymy, homophony, and homography are the primary <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> semantics classes. While those concepts are necessary <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> semantics and are usually taught, teachers of semantics must be well aware that they are not the primary <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> semantics. They are secondary materials. This paper describes the main <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> semantics which consist of word meaning, sentence meaning, and utterance meaning...|$|R
5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Indraloris is {{considered}} to be a valid genus within the family Sivaladapidae, containing two named species: I.himalayensis from India and I.kamlialensis from Pakistan. A third species may be represented in the Pakistani <b>material</b> <b>of</b> Indraloris. However, Indraloris has had a complicated taxonomic history, and some of the known material was misidentified as members of other mammalian groups for decades.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Alloxylon flammeum was mistakenly known as Embothrium (and later Oreocallis) wickhamii—Queensland {{botanist}} Frederick Manson Bailey had illustrated it using Embothrium wickhamii in the Queensland Agricultural Journal in 1899.

5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from <b>material</b> <b>of</b> varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} <b>material</b> <b>of</b> a large nodosaurid from Utah, {{discovered in a}} member of the Cedar Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, but it was never named. In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{interaction}} between the backfill and the overlying strata in paste filling mining, experiments were conducted on new similar <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> filling like raw <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> river sand, fly ash and cement, and the setting time and uniaxial compressive strength were main parameters. The optimal proportion <b>of</b> similar <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> filling was obtained by the uniform design method. Results show that there is a negative correlation between the uniaxial compressive strength <b>of</b> the similar <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> filling and the sand content and a positive correlation between the strength and cement content. The fly ash could not only reduce the setting time, but also could lead to a decrease in strength. The optimal proportion of river sand, fly ash and cement is 31 : 7 : 1, when the geometrically similar ratio is 1 : 100. Simulation test results using similar <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> filling prove that it could meet the experimental requirements...|$|R

5|$|Known <b>material</b> <b>of</b> Dermotherium {{includes}} {{a handful of}} jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred <b>material</b> <b>of</b> this species from Pakistan {{includes a}} single M2.|$|E
