Introduction: The Subject <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> is <b>of</b> {{the utmost}} {{importance}} to the horticulturist. Upon the thoro understanding of its principles and methods depends {{the success of the}} orchard. Scientific <b>pruning</b> <b>of</b> the fruit tree at different stages of its growth, is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the best results. It so happens that the stem or subject is in a transitional stage at the present time, so that no absolute rules can be laid down for the amateur fruit-grower. A thoro understanding of the principles should be obtained before you start to prune. And then, keeping these principles always in view the operation should be varied to suit the conditions and environment of the individual plant under consideration. What would be the proper treatment to give the desired result under one set of conditions, might produce just the opposite results under a different set. The transitional period is due, to some extent to the attempted introduction of entirely new methods by Mr. H. M. Stringfellow, of Galveston, Texas. He has proposed a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>pruning,</b> which, if adopted, would entirely change the methods and principles which govern orchard setting at the present time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMotor neurons that {{innervate}} the dorsal longitudinal (flight) muscles, DLMs, make multiple {{points of}} contact {{along the length}} of fibers. The stereotypy of the innervation lies in the number of contact points (CPs) made by each motor neuron and is established as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> that occurs during metamorphosis. Coincident with the onset <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> is the arrival of glial processes that eventually ensheath persistent branches. To test a possible role for glia during <b>pruning,</b> the development <b>of</b> adult-specific glial ensheathment was disrupted using a targeted expression of dominant negative shibire. Such a manipulation resulted in fewer contact points at the DLM fibers. The development of innervation was examined during metamorphosis, specifically to test if the reduction was a consequence <b>of</b> increased <b>pruning.</b> We quantified the number of branches displaying discontinuities in their membrane, an indicator of the level <b>of</b> <b>pruning.</b> Disrupting the formation of glial ensheathment resulted in a two-fold increase in the discontinuities, indicating that pruning is enhanced. Thus glial–neuronal interactions, specifically during pruning are important for the patterning of adult innervation. Our studies also suggest that FasII plays a role in mediating this communication. At the end <b>of</b> the <b>pruning</b> phase, FasII localizes to glia, which envelops each of the stabilized contact points. When glial FasII levels are increased using the Gal 4 /UAS <b>system</b> <b>of</b> targeted expression, <b>pruning</b> <b>of</b> secondary branches is enhanced. Our results indicate that glia regulate <b>pruning</b> <b>of</b> secondary branches by influencing the balance between stabilization and pruning. This was confirmed by an observed rescue of the innervation phenotype of FasII hypomorphs by over expressing FasII in glia...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to determine, for the main species of Eucalyptus grown in the south west of Ireland (Kerry), the best means <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> to optimise marketable juvenile foliage production and quality over the crops life cycle. The majority of the trials were carried out in Co. Kerry where a higher concentration of production is located. The favourable climate and light acid soils in this region promote satisfactory growth and enables harvesting to take place from autumn to March which is the premium period. Results of extensive trials over a four year trial period showed that new plantations should not be pruned {{until the end of}} the second growing season to allow the trees to become well established and help build up photosynthetic food reserves and prevent tree losses. However in some situations where very vigorous growth was achieved during the first growing season a very light pruning at 1. 3 m high helped stabilise trees. After the second year's growth, pruning back to a height of 1. 2 m consistently produced the highest marketable production of quality juvenile foliage of Eucalyptus species pulverulenta, perriniana, parvifolia, and 'Glaucescens' over the trial period. Pruning back to this level helped develop a single or multiple main stem framework (2 - 3 stems) for future production purposes, providing a nice manageable tree facilitating not only harvesting but other technical operations such as pruning and spraying. It was found that more severe pruning, especially back to 15 - 25 cm from the ground, reduced output and in some cases quality but was responsible for significant tree losses varying from 8 - 12 % in the second growing year to over 30 % losses with four year plantations, with further losses of 5 - 10 % expected as well because of very weak plants. The main recommendations of this study are that no pruning be carried out for the first two growing seasons and thereafter a relatively light <b>pruning</b> <b>of</b> all main framework leaders back to 1. 2 m high after the winter period. As the plantations grew older, stronger side branches could be shortened and later still could be removed to facilitate management of the crop. The light pruning treatments to 1. 2 m high in contrast to the most severe pruning regimes produced no significant tree losses in the main production areas in Co. Kerry and would appear to be the most sustainable <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> management over the crops life cycle. End of Project Repor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pruning operators, such as cut, are {{important}} to develop ef-ficient logic programs as they allow programmers to reduce the search space and thus discard unnecessary computations. For parallel <b>systems,</b> the presence <b>of</b> <b>pruning</b> operators introduces the problem of speculative computations. A computation is named speculative {{if it can be}} pruned during parallel evaluation, therefore resulting in wasted effort when com-pared to sequential execution. In this work we discuss the problems be-hind the management of speculative computations in or-parallel tabled logic programs. In parallel tabling, not only the answers found for the query goal may not be valid, but also answers found for tabled predicates may be invalidated. The problem here is even more serious because to achieve an efficient implementation it is required to have the set of valid tabled answers released as soon as possible. To deal with this, we propose a strategy to deliver tabled answers as soon as it is found that they are safe from being pruned, and present its implementation in the OPTYap parallel tabling system. ...|$|R

By researching on the pruning method based on misclassification, introduced the conception of condition misclassification and improved the standard <b>of</b> <b>pruning.</b> Propose the conditional misclassification pruning method for decision tree optimization and apply it in C 4. 5 algorithm. The experiment result shows that the condition misclassification pruning can avoid over pruned problem and non-enough pruned problem to some extent and improve the accurate of classification...|$|R
