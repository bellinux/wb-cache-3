5|$|The next morning, Ann fears {{she made}} out with {{someone at the}} party but cannot remember. She {{eventually}} learns she made out with Chris, who shows a romantic interest in her. Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|Hajibeyov devoted {{much energy}} {{to the idea of}} {{integrating}} woman's role and status into the male-dominated world.

25|$|Kiki: A spunky, tomboyish {{girl who}} often <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> others. Many of her stories involve plots where {{the danger of}} {{carelessness}} or deceitfulness, {{as well as the}} danger of the past repeating itself. Also notable is {{that a large number of}} the characters in her stories are also of African descent, though the trend dies off later on in the series.

He {{is not much}} of a bully, however, as he usually <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> {{everyone}} and plays practical jokes. He is older than others in his class, as it took him three years to graduate from sixth grade. Roger and his divorced mother lived in a trailer park in the Nickelodeon series; in the Disney series, Roger's family becomes wealthy from a real-estate deal struck between the owner of the trailer park and the Bluff family.

500|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of How I Spent My Vacation was the parody of film, popular culture, and celebrities.

500|$|The college cheer, , is so {{pervasive}} in college {{history and culture}} {{that in addition to}} being shouted during academic ceremonies and football games, it is also used as a salutation in correspondence between alumni. [...] The college's fight song, [...] is sung to the tune of 99 Bottles of Beer and <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> a number of rival colleges, including the University of Pittsburgh, but was modified sometime before 1958 to laud Washington Female Seminary.

Much of the flashback was pitched by Conan O'Brien. The episode marks the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers. The staff wanted to introduce a boss for Skinner, and Wallace Wolodarsky pitched his name.

500|$|Jean MacCurdy {{said that}} How I Spent My Vacation <b>makes</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> summer {{vacations}} by mocking [...] "the boredom of summer {{and some of}} those horrible car trips" [...] (an issue that was first explored in National Lampoon's Vacation). [...] In the film, the Hampton family car trip is very taxing for Plucky Duck; he is disgusted by the family and is nearly killed by an escaped lunatic that the family mistakes for a hitchhiker (He happens to be a caricature of Jason Voorhees). [...] The film's fictional theme park, [...] "HappyWorldLand", is a spoof of Disneyland. The film also parodies the THX logo and Deep Note when Fowlmouth and Shirley are at the movie theater.|$|E
