40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the inner ear disorder Menière’s disease is associated with a pathological middle ear ventilation or rather with a pathological <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure,</b> which might be responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between middle ear and inner ear, more precisely between negative <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> and Menière’s disease. The present study used long-term <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> measurements in patients with Menière’s disease for the first time. Thirty-three patients with Menière’s disease used Otoflex 100 (GN Otometrics) to perform mobile repetitive tympanometry. Due to portability of the device, measurements were performed during daily activities by the subjects themselves. In addition to the long-term measurements, a <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> equalization provocation test was performed during an elevator ride over 12 floors in the university hospital in Aachen. Comparisons with two control groups, one group of twenty patients with sensorineural hearing loss and one group of thirty healthy subjects, were made. The results of the long-term pressure measurements over 24 hours showed that the <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> of patients with Menière’s disease was significantly lower than the <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> of the two control groups. Furthermore, in patients with Menière’s disease, the ability of pressure equilibration in the middle ear was significantly worse than that of the control groups in the elevator provocation test. The results of both tests confirm the theory that Menière’s disease is related to a middle ear ventilation. Both tests suggest a defective middle ear ventilation in patients with Menière’s disease. The long-term measurement turned out to be a useful diagnostic method to split the heterogonous group of patients with Menière’s disease into two subgroups on the basis of a mean <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> of - 40 daPa. Forty-five percent of all patients with Menière’s disease showed a very low <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> which suggests that middle ear ventilation might be involved in the pathogenesis of Menière’s disease.

To reach this goal, our research follows a dual approach by 1) developing techniques and methods for further recirculation of nutrient solutions, and 2) end-of-pipe solutions for emission via discharge of the nutrient solutions. Here we present our research on an end-of-pipe solution for PPPs, which is the use of water purification techniques. The technologies are tested on effectiveness of removing PPPs from so-called ‘Standardised Water’, which contains specified amounts of nutrients, dissolved organic matter and twelve active ingredients of PPPs. Also applicability in a greenhouse environment and economic feasibility are examined. Four technologies were chosen to be investigated: 1) Ozone with and without activated carbon, 2) Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) with <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> UV-radiation, 3) H 2 O 2 with low pressure UV-radiation, and 4) Electrochemical flocculation.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the intra-articular pressure in horses with distal forelimbs chronic lameness in order to obtain indication about the diagnostic significance of pressure variations. Fifty-six distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the forelimbs of 36 horses were investigated by a clinical and radiographic examination and by measuring the pressure with a hand held digital manometer. Forty coffin joints of sound horses were used as a control. The pick pressure was registered for each articulation. The <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> measured with the sound horse bearing weight on both limbs was 36. 8 mmHg +/- 16. 0 and 69. 6 mmHg +/- 27. 3 when the contralateral was lift up. For the diseased horse the <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> measured in the two position was 66. 5 mmHg +/- 7. 6 and 132. 8 mmHg +/- 43. 3 respectively.

No correlation have been found between articular pressure and kind of radiographic changes of the DIP joint or of the distal sesamoid bone. Pressure measurement could be considered a useful aid to localize a pathologic condition involving the DIP joint or the navicular bone, but the technique shows some limitation: it seems to be more reliable for diagnosis with both limbs weight bearing because low specificity arises with the contralateral lifted up.

40|$|Abstract The LNG {{production}} plant processing natural {{gas from the}} Snøhvit field outside Hammerfest in northern Norway utilizes heat and power produced locally with gas turbines. Building a new production train supplied with electricity from the power grid is being evaluated as a possible solution for reducing CO 2 emissions from the plant. Buying electricity from the grid rather than producing it in a {{combined heat and power}} plant makes it necessary {{to find new ways to}} cover the heat loads at the {{production plant}}. A project thesis was written in the fall semester 2010 evaluating the possibility of generating the necessary heat with heat pumps. It was concluded that parts of the required heat could be delivered with reasonable efficiencies using heat pumps. Further, a heat pump delivering heat to the CO 2 -removal system was analyzed. Simulations showed that the required heat load, reaching approximately 62 MW at full production, could be delivered from a heat pump using butane as working fluid. The electrical power consumption for the compressors would be 23. 3 MW, giving the heat pump a COP of 2. 66. In this master thesis the heat pump suggested earlier is analyzed, focusing on identifying losses. Several possible changes that will enhance the heat pump’s efficiency are suggested. The use of other workings fluids and mixed refrigerants are analyzed as well, using the process simulation software Pro/II. The simulations indicates that the heat pump should be equipped with a flash tank at <b>middle</b> <b>pressure,</b> thereby reducing throttling losses and required mass flows through the evaporators. In addition, the suction gas should be overheated as much as possible. Using mixed refrigerants lowers the efficiency of the heat pump. Finally, two new systems are suggested: One with butane as workings fluid and one with pentane, both with flash tank at <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> and superheated suction gas. The pentane-system gives the highest system COP, but requires much bigger compressors than the butane-system. The table shows the most important results.

Covering the heat required by the CO 2 removal system with a gas fired furnace would generate CO 2 emissions of approximately 120, 000 tons per year.

Patient complaints of airway obstruction {{that are consistent with}} intranasal physical findings often lead to septoplasty and turbinate surgery. Severe nasal septal deviation leads to complete nasal obstruction and disturbs air passage from nostrils, however the effect of septal deviation and nasal obstruction surgery (septoplasty) on Eustachian tube function and <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> is controversial and isn’t clear.

A graphic display of the measurement is called a tympanogram. Characteristics of tympanograms have been quantified with several measures, e. g., peak compensated static acoustic admittance (Ytm) and equivalent ear canal volume (Vec). In the past decades, numerous investigations confirmed the effect of several middle-ear pathologies on tympanometric measures.

Introduction Many plasma characteristics depend on the gas (translational) temperature, T G. There are several T G estimation methods e. g. by using pressure rise in closed systems due to temperature rise, by using thermocouples, spectral methods [1] etc. The gas temperature is frequently estimated on the basis of rotational temperature, T Rot, of some molecules M* (e. g.

First of all, the population of rotational states should follow the Boltzmann distribution. Besides, one of the next cases should be valid: (1) the initial rotational population distribution (i. e. distribution just after the excitation) of M* corresponds to that equilibrium with T G (hereafter: thermalized distribution).

Swallowing provokes a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ that precedes the peristaltic contraction. We aimed {{to prove that the}} swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ is due to relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall at that level. METHODS: Studies were performed in five healthy subjects. Oesophageal pressures were measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. A rubber balloon opposite the <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor was used to induce the artificial HPZ. A barostat bag was glued to {{the opposite side of the}} balloon. The pressure in the barostat bag was pre-set at 8 mmHg below the pressure measured in the artificial HPZ. We studied deglutition-induced variations in the barostat bag volume after single and multiple swallows. RESULTS: Immediately after single swallows and during multiple swallows, we observed a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ and a significant increase in the barostat bag volume (254 +/- 67 %) from 0. 99 (0. 37 - 1. 93) to 3. 74 (1. 91 - 4. 34) (P = 0. 005) denoting oesophageal wall relaxation. CONCLUSION: The swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ represents a real relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall due to deglutitive inhibition. The oesophageal artificial HPZ is a simple method that can be used to study inhibitory phenomena in the body of the human oesophagus. status: publishe...|$|E

This {{paper will}} provide an {{overview}} on potential applications for the aerospace industry for repairing aircraft {{as well as to}} ensure salvage for identified hot spots in terms of fatigue and crack growth performance. Residual stress engineering is a field of engineering aiming to improve the economic and ecological impact of future aircraft structures by controlling the residual stresses induced by Laser Shock Peening (LSP). Managing the residual stresses for designing structures represents an innovative approach for next generation aircraft. Predicting crack turning induced via a LSP treatment and the optimization of the LSP treatment itself for reaching the crack growth design stress for the targeted weight benefit will be discussed. Advanced forming processes in aircraft manufacturing represent another potential area of interest and the benefits and challenges of applying laser peen forming in this context will be presented. The aeronautical industry requirements for future developments of the laser shock process will also be included for applications ranging from the repair environment to design and manufacturing of aircraft structures. Historical Background In laser peening treatment the sample is subjected to short duration pulses from a laser which generates confined plasma on the surface. The plasma pressure (up to 10 GPa) turns transmitted into the sample via shock waves which plastically deform the treated region. The local plastic deformation causes compressive residual stresses to develop into the material (fig. 1).

In felsic granulite samples, the assemblage K-feldspar-garnet-kyanite-Zr-rich rutile is replaced by sillimanite and Zr-poor rutile. Modelling these assemblages supports minimum conditions of ~ 13 kbar/ 925 °C, and a subsequent P-T decrease to 6. 5 - 8. 5 kbar/ 800 - 820 °C. The internal structure and chemistry of zircons, and modelling of zircon dissolution/growth along the inferred P-T paths are used to discuss the significance of the U-Pb ages. In the monotonous unit, inherited zircon ages of 700 - 500 Ma point to sedimentation during the Late Cambrian, while medium-grade metamorphism did not allow the formation of Variscan zircon domains. In both the varied gneiss and felsic granulite units, zircons with a blurred oscillatory-zoned pattern could reflect solid-state recrystallization of older grains during HT metamorphism, whereas zircons with a dark cathodoluminescence pattern are thought to derive from crystallization of an anatectic melt during cooling at <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. The present work proposes that U-Pb zircon ages of ca. 340 Ma probably reflect the end of a widespread HT metamorphic event at middle crustal level...|$|E

40|$|Four {{types of}} {{mathematical}} models of reactors for the ammonia oxidation were developed, namely: simplified diffusion model, two phase model of ideally mixed reactors cascade, two phase plug flow model and two phase plug flow model considering axial dispersion. These models {{take into consideration}} mass and heat transfer in the catalytic bed including heat exchange in the reactor via radiation {{as well as the}} influence of the temperature on the reaction mixture composition and physicochemical properties. The balance equations were solved by the shutting method, global orthogonal collocation method and method of orthogonal collocation on the finite elements. It was found that shutting method is not suitable for the solving of these model equations. Developed mathematical models were compared {{on the basis of the}} criteria taking into the account their ability to describe the basic experimentally determined trends, computing time, accuracy of the results and their stability. On the basis of these criteria the two phase plug flow model with axial dispersion was evaluated as the most suitabel and this model was used in the following studies. The influence of the boundary conditions and choice of the "reference stay" used for computation of transport and physicochemical properties was studied. It was found that the choice of "reference stay" effects the obtained results. The parametric study of the reactor in the <b>middle</b> <b>pressure</b> unit for nitric acid production was performedutilising GPM method. This method had to be modified for the purposes of this study. It was necessary to reduce the choice of the fixed variables in the solution corrector, to introduce the control of the step lenght along the parametric curve in the dependence on the number of iterations in the solution corrector and on the magnitude of the changes in the estimated solution. The influence of the load, pressure, catalyst specific surface, composition and preheating of input gases on the ractor behaviour was studied using this method. The calculated values are in good agreement with the experimentally determined dependencies. E. g. the calculated ignition temperature 200 C is in accordance with the value observed experimentally. The developed model in connection with the commercial software ASPEN PLUS was used for optimisation study of the nitrogen oxide production unit in regard to the maximum concentration of NO in unit gases.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} nasal obstruction and otitis media, 10 ferrets were studied before and after either unilateral (n 5) or bilateral (n 5) nasal obstruction. Observations included otomicroscopic assessments of middle ear status, tympanometric recordings of <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> and forced-response, inflation-deflation and continuous monitor-ing tests of Eustachian tube function. During the 6 – 8 week post-obstruction follow-up period no animal developed evidence of otitis media. Abnormal positive <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressures</b> lasting {{for the period of}} follow-up occurred only in the animals with bilateral nasal obstruction. Eustachian tube function test results showed these pressures to be generated during swallowing.

This study aims {{to compare the}} effects of Mero-cel nasal packs and silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway on the ventilation and <b>pressure</b> of the <b>middle</b> ear when applied intranasally after septoplasty for isolated septal deviation. Study Design. A prospective, randomized trial. Setting. A tertiary referral center. Subjects and Methods. Fifty-one patients who underwent septoplasty for nasal respiratory impairment caused by septal deviation were randomized into 2 groups. After septoplasty, bilateral anterior Merocel nasal packs were applied in one group, while silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway were applied in the other group. <b>Middle</b> ear <b>pressures</b> were compared using preoperative and post-operative tympanometry. Results. Pathological decrease in the <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressure</b> in at least 1 ear was determined in 17 patients (73. 9 %) in the Merocel group compared with only 6 patients (21. 4 %) in the silicone nasal septal splint group at the 48 th postoperative hour. In the first 24 hours following surgery, decreases in tym-panometric pressures were seen in both groups, but more in the Merocel group. After 24 hours, <b>middle</b> ear <b>pressures</b> continued to decrease in the Merocel group but started to increase in the silicone nasal septal splint group. Conclusion. Because they allow inhalation through the nose and cause less Eustachian tube dysfunction than Merocel, using silicone nasal septal splints with integral airway instead of packing after septoplasty seems a more reasonable option...|$|R
