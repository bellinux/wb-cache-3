It recorded more than 510,000 visitors from more than 30 countries, and Africa Milk Project {{was chosen as the}} best of 800 projects worldwide, for Best Practice in the [...] "Sustainable development of small rural communities in marginal areas" [...] category. Various acquisition operations are part of the product diversification strategy, aimed at enhancing the Group's presence on international markets: Gennari S.p.A., a company in Parma that specialises in making Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto di Parma, the long-standing Pastificio Granarolo, that makes and markets egg and semolina pasta, and CONBIO, an important Italian company that specialises in making vegetable and organic gastronomic products. Abroad, via the subsidiary, Granarolo International S.r.l., Granarolo Chile was set up, and Bioleche Lacteos was acquired, a long-standing Chilean cooperative of 300 dairy farmers, with a productive facility, and numerous other acquisitions were concluded: European Foods Ltd, the leading importer and distributor of Made in Italy products in New Zealand, Yema Distribuidora de Alimentos Ltda, a company that specialises in producing and marketing cheese products in Brazil, with two productive facilities, and Vinaio OÜ, renamed Granarolo Baltics OÜ, a company that operates in the cheese and dairy products marketing sector and in importing quality Italian products into Estonia. Then there was, Matric Italgross AB, a leading Swedish company that distributes Italian brands, and Comarsa SA, a Made in Italy Food distribution company in Switzerland.|$|E

The ex Yomo Group also included the CSL - Centro Sperimentale del Latte Experimentation Centre, tasked with producing probiotics for alimentary and pharmaceutical use (sold to the Sacco Group in 2013).During 2006 the [...] "historical" [...] Centrale del Latte factory in Milan closed, {{because it was not}} included in the acquisition. Its production was transferred to what was previously the Yomo plant in Pasturago.In 2008 the Group was reorganised, which lead to the closure of the subsidiary Agriok S.p.A. (which operated in the chain traceability sector), and the gastronomic branch of the Company (Vogliazzi) was sold off, as was the Sermoneta cheese factory (whereas the Pettinicchio brand was retained), and the plant in Acqui Terme (selling the Merlo brand). In 2010 the Group set up Zeroquattro S.r.l., an integrated logistics services Company with a specific, albeit not exclusive, vocation for transporting and distributing fresh food products, via a refrigerated chain at 0 °C to 4 °C.On the social commitment front, Granarolo was one of the promoters, along with CEFA Onlus, of the Africa Milk Project, an international self-development cooperation project, set up to create a <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> in Njombe, one of the poorest parts of Tanzania.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} the main {{findings of a}} set of comparative <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> surveys carried out in Kathmandu (Nepal), Nairobi (Kenya), and Santa Cruz (Bolivia). The surveys assessed changes in demand, supply and marketing of milk and milk products over a ten to fifteen year period to 2001. This chapter considers the changes in demand and market share, the supply-side changes, the trading pathways, the policy framework, the growth in the sector and poverty reduction.

40|$|Traditional (informal) {{milk market}} {{accounts}} for 97 percent of fresh milk supply I Assam {{and attempts to}} establish dairy cooperatives have had limited success. In areas with relatively poor market access, these informal markets represent the only market opportunity for dairy farmers. However, widespread concerns about milk safety and quality have led to decision makers and government support services to ignore or penalize the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> A series of studies among milk value chain actors was conducted {{to better understand the}} <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> in Assam, assess the risk to human health posed by the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector,</b> and develop an action plan for improving the performance of the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> Key findings of the studies are: (1) most milk samples do not meet microbiological standards; (2) adulteration of milk is widespread but does not appear to represent a risk to human health; (3) milk handling practices are very poor and is associated with low levels of food safety; and (4) only a minority of milk is pasteurized, and while this does reduce the level of bacterial count, it does not guarantee absence of adulteration or compliance with standards. The risk assessment of the dairy supply chain suggests the following key results: (1) the majority of milk sampled in urban Assam did not meet local standards and may present a risk to public health and (2) formal milk outlets are no better than informal milk outlets in terms of the level of compliance with milk quality standards. Opportunities to potentially improve food safety in traditional milk markets are thus possible and the most promising intervention is some form of certification scheme involving training of informal milk vendors in milk handling...|$|E

Turkey, on the other hand, pursues different support policy in the <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> The producers, who are registered in the Farming Registration System, receive milk incentive premiums. There are no similarities between Turkish milk support policy and European Union’s milk support policy. According to the last progress reports, Turkey has to improve Farming Registration System.

40|$|The {{production}} of milk is facing major {{challenges in the}} coming reforms of Common Agricultural policy (CAP). At {{the same time the}} global market demand for refined milk products is changing mostly because of increasing welfare in Asian market (China, India). These EU and global level changes affect Finnish agriculture in many ways. In this paper {{the focus is on the}} future of milk production in Northern perspective studied with one of the futures studies method, the Delphi method. The Delphi method aims to identify and explore alternative future possibilities, their probabilities of occurrence, and their desirability by tapping into the expertise of respondents. The studied themes in the Delphi questionnaires were defined according to their policy relevancy. The themes were 1) the structural change of milk production 2) the agricultural policy changes 3) the changes in milk market and national economy 4) the changes in technology, production processes and know-how and 5) the changes in consumption and in societal values. These themes interact closely with each other, and therefore they are interpreted as a whole to capture a holistic view on the future milk production in Finland. We produce alternative future images for the <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> in Finland between 2007 and 2025 based on views and argumentation of the Delphi panel experts. The first round of the Delphi study was carried out by structured questionnaire (internet survey) including five face-to-face interviews and the second feedback round followed the same procedure. The panel consisted of 30 national experts familiar with the <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> The future images of the <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> are constructed and related policy choices are recognized by analysing major driving forces and directions of development in terms of their importance, likelihood and desirability. An analytical framework to assess strategic decision-making challenges is outlined and key issues to be taken into account in the future policy design are identified. The derived future images give a clear picture about policy challenges and alternative development paths that the <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> as well as the CAP has to be prepared to cope with by the year 2025.

40|$|The {{country is}} facing {{one of the}} biggest {{challenges}} since its independence – the process of the EU accession. Taking into consideration that „forecasting important economic events is source of power“ (Howitt, 2005), the aim of this paper is to develop a model in order to assess the impact of the EU membership on the Macedonian agriculture. The model is recursive, dynamic, multi-product partial equilibrium model for the meat, dairy and cereals sector in the Republic of Macedonia. It follows the AGMEMOD principles, hence comprising the local features of the Macedonian agriculture. The baseline scenario shows a positive growth of the pig meat, lamb meat and cow <b>milk</b> <b>sectors.</b> On the other hand, in the EU scenarios the most positive effect is expected in the extensive sectors, e. g the sheep and beef productions. The grains show modest growth on the supply side, but the projections on the net-trade demonstrate further deficit increase. The biggest gain in the EU scenarios comes from the higher level of prices, but also from the higher budgetary support. Compared with the experiences of the previous enlargements, the model confirms the expectations about the development of the selected sectors after the EU accession. partial equilibrium model, agricultural policy, Macedonian agriculture, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The phasing-out of the EU {{milk quota}} regime in 2015 {{challenges}} the Austrian <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> {{and calls for}} its re-organization. Private raw milk management systems and contracts between milk producers and milk processors and traders will replace the national milk quota regime. The aim {{of the study is}} to provide information to political and private agents on future contracts and the re-organization of the dairy sector. Consequently, we use qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to reveal the perspectives, preferences, and aims of dairy CEOs and milk producers in Austria. The surveys follow a case study approach. We have selected eight dairies based on distinct criteria to conduct face to face interviews as well as a standard questionnaire procedure. Furthermore, a stratified sample of 1, 500 corresponding milk producers has been drawn to perform a standard questionnaire procedure as well. A main part of the surveys focuses on the design of contracts between dairies and milk producers. Consequently, the study reveals common and distinct interests between the dairies’ CEOs and milk producers. Comparisons to two Austrian and one German study provide an overview on the development of milk producer perspectives over time and the specificities of the Austrian <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> The results reveal a rather heterogeneous <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> with respect to the perspectives, preferences, and aims among as well as between the groups of milk producers and dairies’ CEOs.

Hence—since an output-oriented approach was adopted—the elimination of the production cap {{as a result of the}} abolition of milk quotas may marginally contribute to increasing milk farm productivity, because productivity might basically depend on exogenous factors that affect technology.|$|R

This dissertation investigates the key drivers, planning, limitations and benefits surrounding the adoption of goat milking systems for six established case studies in New Zealand. All six case studies {{are located in the}} Waikato and supply the Dairy Goat Co-operative (DGC). Five of the case studies are indoor systems and one is an outdoor system. Key drivers behind the dairy goat system adoption were influenced by individual circumstances and constraints of their initial systems. They included the financial returns involved, including a consistent payout; also farm ownership opportunities, lifestyle changes and being forced out of their original systems {{due to a lack of}} profitability. The case studies utilised established farms as a source of information during the planning and establishment phases. The case studies were identified as early adopters. The main benefit surrounding the adoption was the financial returns, they exceeded expectations and added stability to their income. The main limitation was highlighted to be the cap on shares, which limited growth but was beneficial to the consistency of their payout. The case studies were positive about the future of the dairy goat industry.

40|$|A main {{challenge}} for {{the players on the}} world dairy market is to efficiently respond to the changes of the local markets characteristics, {{in the context of an}} increasingly fierce competition for the raw milk obtained on the farms. From the analysis, it results that the performance of the Romanian <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> is seriously affected by the excessive fragmentation of supply, which reveals the subsistence and semi-subsistence phenomenon that persists in the <b>milk</b> <b>sector,</b> as the main factor that constrains competitiveness growth. In reference to the volume of investments in the dairy processing sector, it results that this had a slow growth rate in the investigated period, the share in total investments in the food sector ranging from 7. 8 % (2000) to 16. 9 % (2011). The investments in agriculture in total investments accounted for 4. 9 % in the year 2012.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to give information about the milk marketing characteristics in Sugamuxi province. The commercialization channels were identified and the commercial agents’ participation margins were established along with {{the current state of the}} links that form the production chain. Furthermore, the diffusion and application of the Treaty of Competitiveness of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Sector</b> (ACCL) and of its system of prices were evaluated. This analysis discovered problems in two clearly defined areas based on topographical conditions (plain and hillside areas). They each present different problems and use different commercialisation channels. For this reason 235 surveys were given to the different links of the chain in each area. The commercialisation channel in plain areas is: producer, regional processors, wholesaler, consumer, and in hillside areas: producer, transporters, regional processor, local distributor and consumer. The commercialisation margins were calculated for raw milk, pasteurised milk and cheese. Because the profits are greater the great majority of producers in the plain areas are not applying the prices system. Furthermore, there is deficient knowledge of the ACCL on the part of the other links of the chain. Added to the small amount of information about the <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> and the regional participants the development of a national competitive milk chain is blocked...|$|E

On the other hand, a technological change index of less than 1 means that similar input volumes produce smaller output amounts. This implies that milk producers {{have to be considered}} to be efficient and that the reduction in productivity—found especially after 2009 —is not the result of the ability of dairy farmers to use their inputs efficiently but might mainly be related to other factors (e.g., market shocks, milk price volatility).|$|E

40|$|Multilateral trade {{agreement}} under the auspice of the GATT/WTO {{is expected to}} change the nation 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness in the global economy. In {{the context of the}} agricultural agreement, there are three mayor changing policies to be committed by the WTO members: (a) market access, (b) export subsidies and (c) domestic support. Likewise, ASEAN regional agreement (AFTA) will reduce the relative price of International prices to the domestic prices and the exploitation of the comparative advantage. The questions to be answered is whether such multilateral agreements affect agricultural trade in the region. A recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) and the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database were used to assess such impacts. Two important scenarios were then considered: APEC and AFTA scenarios. The results indicate that as import tariff levels are completely removed, the demand for imported goods would certainly be increased. This is because domestic consumers (private consumers and industries) would face decreasing domestic prices. However, the size of import changes depends on the initial tariff rates. The higher the initial intra-regional tariffs, and the larger the tariff cuts, the higher the gains from the trade creation. Under the AFTA trade liberalisation, rice output in the ASEAN member countries with the exception of Thailand is projected to shrink. The AFTA tariff reduction would cause an increase in exports in most ASEAN economic sectors. Focusing on the export changes in the agricultural sectors, it is reported that the cereal and processed <b>milk</b> <b>sectors</b> are predicted to have noticeable increases in their exports. However, since trade liberalisation would have adverse effects on the uncompetitive producing sectors, adjustment assistance is highly recommended in order to compensate for any losses; for instance, reduced farm incomes...|$|R
