While {{techniques}} and tools for Web marketing are being actively developed, {{there is much}} less available for Web <b>merchandising.</b> This paper contributes {{to the area of}} Web usage analysis for E-commerce <b>merchandising.</b> First, we categorize areas of analysis for Web <b>merchandising</b> such as product assortment, <b>merchandising</b> cues, shopping metaphors, and Web design features.

The new metrics provide capabilities for examining data about <b>merchandising</b> in online stores, and detailed insight into the effectiveness of different Web <b>merchandising</b> efforts by answering related business questions. Third, we present a set of novel visualizations that explore patterns in micro-conversions in online stores reflecting in customer responses to various Web <b>merchandising</b> efforts. Through an empirical study using lookto-buy data from an online store, we demonstrate how the proposed starfield visualizations can be used to understand the shopping behavior in an online store and the effectiveness of various <b>merchandising</b> schemes it employs. Finally, we discuss the types of data required for this kind of visual analysis of online <b>merchandising,</b> and briefly describe how the data can be collected and integrated from an E-commerce site. ...|$|R
