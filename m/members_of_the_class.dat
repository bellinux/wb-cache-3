5|$|Maunsell’'s successor, Oliver Bulleid, {{oversaw the}} {{building}} of twenty <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> at Eastleigh railway works between January 1938 and September 1939. Bulleid {{is reported to have}} found the Q Class uninspiring, having been manufactured to traditional Victorian principles of locomotive design, and is said to have stated that the order for the Q Class would have been cancelled if he had been appointed CME earlier. However, Bulleid had ample opportunity either to cancel the order or to build and test a single prototype, without incurring the expense of building twenty <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> if this was the case.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{earliest}} Medal <b>of</b> Honor recipient {{educated at}} the United States Military Academy was John Cleveland Robinson, a non-graduating <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> 1839. <b>The</b> first alumnus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Military Academy (USMA) to perform actions {{to be recognized}} with <b>the</b> Medal <b>of</b> Honor was Charles Henry Tompkins, a non-graduating <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> 1851, while <b>the</b> last alumnus to perform actions so recognized was Andre Lucas, a graduating <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> 1954.|$|R
50|$|In CZF, it is {{consistent}} to assume <b>the</b> universe <b>of</b> all sets is indecomposable—so that any class for which membership is decided (every set {{is either a}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> or else not a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class)</b> is either empty or the entire universe.|$|R
5|$|<b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> lasted {{in service}} until 1964, and two {{examples}} have survived into preservation: number 245 in the National Railway Museum, and 53 (as BR 30053) on the Swanage Railway.|$|E
5|$|Western Region based {{examples}} had hand/foot holds {{cut into}} the smoke deflectors replacing the original handrails after a major derailment, to improve forward visibility. Some of these deflectors subsequently migrated to other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|All <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> entered British Railways {{service in}} 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, {{which had become}} worn through intensive use. A few <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, {{the withdrawal of the}} ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive {{due to the fact that}} they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The Merchant Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Seven S15s {{have been}} preserved, two Urie {{examples}} and five by Maunsell, {{and can be}} seen at several heritage railways around the country. All the surviving <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were purchased from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. Currently only 499 and 830 have yet to steam in preservation. 825, 828 and 841 have all operated on the main line at certain points in their preservation careers, though 825 has only run between Grosmont & Whitby.|$|E
5|$|The pulley {{system was}} {{eventually}} deemed unsafe due to instances of sagging and delayed reaction. As a result, it was replaced on 36engines by a safer {{compressed air system}} between 1930 and 1937. This system had seen previous successful use on the LBSCR. Because the air compressor required extra space for installation, these conversions were confined to the long-framed <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

5|$|Designed at British Railways' Derby Works, the {{new class}} was {{constructed}} at British Railways' Crewe Works between 1951 and 1954. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but {{such was the}} demand for the Britannias on the Eastern Region that more were rushed through construction before the teething problems had been ironed out on the prototypes. In total, 55 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were constructed over three batches at Crewe Works, where each was given improvements to improve reliability and efficiency, and to overcome flaws with the original design.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were {{modified}} {{to carry a}} pair of float planes for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float planes, replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships {{did not have a}} hangar to store it in.|$|E
5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage. Modifications {{were made to}} improve the draughting of the locomotive, incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the condenser array by pipes. No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class.</b> The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out of money, and the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E

5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline after {{completion}} of the Kent Coast route electrification in 1959. The reduction of work precipitated a phased reduction of the class {{that began with the}} withdrawal of No.31409 in November 1962. The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963. Class members based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964, whilst the Southern Region's allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleid's Light Pacifics. The last operational <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were Nos.31405 and31408; both were withdrawn in June 1966.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-six {{amphibian}} {{species are}} found in Michigan, one of the fifty United States. These species include twelve species of frog, twelve species of salamander and two species of toad, all <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> Amphibia. Blanchard's cricket frog, a subspecies of northern cricket frog, {{is considered to be}} threatened and two species, the marbled salamander and small-mouth salamander, are considered endangered; these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan. Two more species, the boreal chorus frog and lesser siren, are considered to be of special concern, although they are not protected under the act. There are no amphibians native to Michigan that are included in the federal Endangered Species Act.|$|E

Among the Weser boats, UB-9 was laid down first, on 6 November 1914, and launched on 6 February 1915, a week ahead of UB-2. These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters, {{but most of}} the other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began {{to send their children}} to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E
5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up {{or in the case of}} Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
