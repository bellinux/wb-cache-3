5|$|Although ship-fired <b>missiles</b> {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are {{susceptible}} to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and <b>missiles.</b> The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm <b>missiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} <b>missiles,</b> an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the <b>missiles</b> had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the <b>missiles</b> loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship <b>missiles,</b> torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air <b>missiles</b> and air-to-surface <b>missiles.</b> At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming <b>missiles.</b> These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic <b>missiles</b> and nuclear <b>missiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground <b>missiles</b> or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air <b>missiles,</b> which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire <b>missiles</b> or a maximum of eight Stinger <b>missiles</b> externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E

5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided <b>Missiles</b> Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided <b>missiles,</b> {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided <b>missiles</b> than in ground-based ballistic <b>missiles,</b> which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|Italian Tornado IDS and ECR {{aircraft}} {{participated in}} the enforcement of a UN no-fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise <b>missiles,</b> each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the <b>missiles</b> {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the <b>missiles</b> were taken from their storage bunker. The <b>missiles</b> with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E

50|$|Command {{guidance}} {{is a type}} of <b>missile</b> {{guidance in}} which a ground station or aircraft relay signals to a guided <b>missile</b> via radio control (or, in a wire-guided <b>missile,</b> through a wire connecting the <b>missile</b> to the launcher) and tell the <b>missile</b> where to steer in order to intercept its target. Additionally, it is possible to send a command to the <b>missile</b> to detonate, even if the <b>missile</b> itself has a fuze or fuzes. (It may be possible to detonate the <b>missile</b> and destroy or damage the target, even though the <b>missile</b> was not actually going to strike the target, due to the blast radius of the warhead).|$|R

5|$|The RAAF's Hornets {{have been}} fitted with several {{different}} types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal M61A1 cannon for use against air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with AIM-9M Sidewinder short range air-to-air <b>missiles</b> and AIM-7M Sparrow medium-range air-to-air <b>missiles.</b> The Sparrows were replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by ASRAAMs. The older <b>missiles</b> are occasionally used in training exercises, however.|$|E
5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range <b>missiles</b> and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range <b>missiles.</b> Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push <b>missiles</b> clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy <b>missiles</b> during high speed flight.|$|E

The MSE <b>missile</b> increases the engagement envelope and defended area by using more responsive control surfaces and a more powerful rocket motor.|$|R
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and ballistic <b>missiles.</b> The ballistic <b>missiles</b> would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the ballistic <b>missiles</b> would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft <b>missiles</b> by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. <b>Missiles</b> could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like {{the time needed to}} get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. <b>Missiles</b> also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these <b>missiles</b> as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
5|$|The nominal battery {{consisted}} of a single DR, three TTRs, two TICs driving six MRTs, and 24 <b>missiles.</b> This basic battery layout could attack three warheads at once, normally using two <b>missiles</b> per salvo in case one failed in flight. More typically, two targets would be attacked while the third system stood by as a hot backup that could take over in-flight. A maximally expanded battery included three DRs, ten TTRs, six TICs driving eighteen MTRs and 72 <b>missiles.</b> Sites requiring higher traffic handling would not build larger systems, but instead deploy additional batteries fed from the same ZAR and Defense Center.|$|E
