Globally, {{there are approximately}} 70 million tones of red mud being produced every year. Highly alkaline red mud, usually pH ranges from 10. 513 and high caustic causes environmental disposal problem and their reuse. The results show that pH of red mud decreased to standard environmental level using mines water.

40|$|In the {{generation}} of power from fossil fuels and biomass, fly ash (FA) is produced and represents both an environmental and economic cost with respect to disposal. However, it also represents a re-use opportunity. Increasing solid waste disposal costs and a focus on sustainable processing necessitates research in alternative uses for fly ash. In this thesis, two ash samples, hog-boiler precipitate ash sample (HBP) and mixed ash pond sample (MAP) from the AV-cell pulp and paper plant were examined for their chemical, physical, thermal, and mineralogical properties.

Result shows that the samples are rich source of alum inosilicate, SiO₂, CaO, and Al₂O₃ which are feedstock for adsorption and zeolite synthesis. The concentration of SiO₂ to Al₂O₃ is greater than 1. 5 therefore indicating good potential for zeolite synthesis.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009 The mining {{industry}} in South Africa {{is one of}} the primary sources of water pollution. Closed down mines leave a legacy of chemically polluted water after closure, and current operating mines are continuously discharging polluted water into the environment, consequently polluting water resources. The chemical pollutants found in this mine waste water include high concentrations of sulphate (up 5 000 mg/L), dissolved heavy metals and iron (II). This water can have pH levels as low as 2. 5 and it is therefore named Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). AMD is formed {{as a result of the}} oxidation of pyritical material, which becomes exposed to oxygen and water during <b>mining</b> activities. While <b>neutralization</b> of the AMD and metal removal has been achieved by using alkaline compounds, sulphate removal to environmentally acceptable levels is still a source of controversy. Environmental, health and water governing bodies are exerting pressure on mines to treat water for sulphate content. A number of processes aimed at sulphate removal, to acceptable levels, are currently in use, and the scope of this thesis concentrates on their development and optimization. Previous research has shown that while limestone (CaC 03) and lime (CaO) were conventionally used for neutralization and metal removal from AMD, these two chemicals also have a potential for partial sulphate removal from sulphate rich water, via gypsum (CaSCU) crystallization. However, a number of drawbacks such the inability to remove sulphate to low levels without addition of excess chemicals has led to the exploration of other chemicals for potential sulphate removal from AMD. Barium salts (Ba(OH) 2, BaS and BaCOa) can also remove sulphate from sulphate rich water, stoichiometrically, via BaSCU precipitation. The use of these chemicals offers an added advantage of recyclability, via thermal reduction of the precipitated BaSCU to BaS, in the presence of a reducing reagent In this thesis, the integrated barium carbonate process for sulphate and metal removal from AMD is presented and consists of the pre-treatment with lime, removal of sulphate as barium sulphate by dosing barium carbonate, the thermal reduction of BaSC> 4 to BaS for sulphur production and possible BaC 03 recycling, and finally H 2 S stripping from the concentrated solution of the recovered BaS is done, leading to sulphur production. From the beaker studies it became evident that sulphate can be removed by dosing the stoichiometrical amount of BaC 03 into the sulphate rich water. The rate of sulphate removal is dependent on the BaC 03 concentration and the sulphate removal is not directly inhibited by the presence of magnesium in the treated water, as was previously assumed to be the case. The sulphate removal rate is only retarded by an alkalinity > 200 mg/L (as CaC 03.) An online particle size measuring experimental set-up was developed to study the precipitation process of BaSCU from the reaction of Ba+ 2 (aq) and S 04 " 2 (aq), with the aim of enhancing particle growth over nudeation, in order to produce BaSC> 4 crystals with improved settling properties. The studies have demonstrated that by changing the reactant concentration, number of feeding points into the precipitator and the stirrer speed, one can affect the extent of the feeding zone and the level of supersatu ration in this zone and control the size of the precipitated particles. The Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) analysis of the precipitation process has shown that growth takes place in all the crystal size ranges, but faster in larger crystals, suggesting a size dependent type of particle growth rate. By lowering the concentrations of the fed Ba+ 2 the local supersatu ration was reduced thus lowering the nudeation rate and as a result increasing particle growth rate. Increasing the number of feed points into the precipitator tube enhanced particle growth. Improved mixing due to increased stirrer speed led to increased particle growth rate, in all particle size ranges and reduced nudeation rate. However, an excessive high stirrer speed led to attrition type nudeation, the result of which is reduced/stunted growth of particles. The results from the studies, carried out using activated carbon as a reducing agent, in a furnace, have shown that the optimum temperature for the reduction of BaSCU to BaS is 950 - 1050 °C, within 15 minutes for a complete reduction in a tube furnace. More than 1 hour was required for more than 60 % yield to be obtained in a muffle furnace. The presence of CaCC> 3 in the reaction mixture does not have a significant effect on the BaS% yield and the BaS% yield in the tube furnace is higher compared to the muffle furnace. The TGA isothermal studies have revealed that the reduction rate of BaSCU using CO is dependent on the partial pressure of CO in the system and is also dependent on the temperature. A first order reaction rate with the average activation energy of 149 (± 10) kJ/mol and constant value (k) of 0. 59 were found to best describe the reaction. An effective H 2 S stripping depends on the balance between the C 02 concentration and the sulphide concentration in the BaS solution. The molar proportionality between C 02 fed and the sulphide stripped was almost equal to 1 only when the pH of the BaS solution was > 12. The results from these studies will be used in the pilot scale implementation of the integrated barium carbonate process which is currently underway at Harmony mine in Randfontein. Doctora...|$|R

When detonation is initiated in some portion of the cloud, the ensuing detonation wave propagates throughout the entire cloud and results in an explosion, generating a tremendous pressure which serves to destroy any land mines present. However, the mechanism with which individual explosive particles interact to sustain detonation in these solid dispersed particle explosives is not clear. In liquids, for example, {{it is known that}} coupling between a propagating shock front and the chemical reaction front which follows is maintained by a “stripping” action of the shock front on the explosive droplets so that an ultrafine mist is produced and swept along in the convective flow behind the shock front [1]. Thus, upon ignition and combustion of this ultrafine mist, coupling is maintained between the shock and reaction fronts. In the case of solid particulate explosives, it is unclear whether it is the shock front alone or a combination of the shock and reaction fronts which initiate subsequent particle detonation. In an effort to more closely examine the generation and propagation of the shock and reaction fronts arising from single particle detonation, and the interaction of these fronts with neighboring particles, high-speed holography is being used to visualize and study these transient phenomena. The shock front generated by detonation of a single explosive particle (100 p. m diameter) may exist as a true shock front only 10 - 50 particle diameters away, and may propagate at velocities approaching 5000 m/s. As a result, the holographic techniques used to study these dispersed particle explosives need be capable of capturing events with lifetimes shorter than 1 gs, thus requiring optical pulse separations between 10 and 200 ns...|$|E
