5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman,</b> Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the health benefits of line dancing activity in Korean <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> This study explored how Korean <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> perceive health benefits through lived experiences of line dancing in their leisure time. Three themes emerged related to health benefits: (1) psychological benefit, (2) physical benefit, and (3) social benefit. This finding suggested that serious leisure experience aids health enhancements in the lives of Korean <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> This study also discusses the research implication that continuous participation in leisure activity is necessary for health improvement in Korean <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{associations}} between {{body mass index}} (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and cardiometabolic risk factors in young and <b>middle-aged</b> Chinese <b>women.</b> Methods: A total of 3011 women (1938 young <b>women,</b> 1073 <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women),</b> who visited our health care center for a related health checkup, were eligible for study. BMI and WC were measured. The subjects were divided into normal and overweight/obesity groups based on BMI, and normal and abdominal obesity groups based on WC. Cardiometabolic variables included triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and blood pressure (BP). Results: The prevalence of overweight/obesity was significantly higher in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> (32. 4 %) than in young women (12. 0 %). The prevalence of abdominal obesity was also higher in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> (60. 3 %) than in young women (36. 2 %). There were {{significant differences in the}} comparison of all related cardiometabolic variables between different BMI (or WC) categories in young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> groups, respectively. After adjustment for age, partial correlation analysis indicated that both BMI and WC were correlated significantly with all related cardiometabolic variables. After adjustment for age and WC, although the correlation coefficient r′ was attenuated, BMI was still correlated significantly with all related cardiometabolic variables in young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> After adjustment for age and BMI, partial correlation analysis showed that WC was correlated significantly with TG, FBG, HOMA-IR, and HDL-C in young women and significantly with TG, HOMA-IR, and HDL-C in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity was high in Chinese young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> BMI was a better predictor of cardiovascular disease and diabetes than WC in young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women,</b> and moreover, measurement of both WC and BMI may be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus than BMI or WC alone...|$|R

Year of the Dog {{is a dark}} comedy about a lonely <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman,</b> played by Molly Shannon, who finds that animals are the only beings she can truly rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon's character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com's Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama Elegy, based on a Phillip Roth novel, The Dying Animal. The film received favorable good reception amongst critics.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman</b> sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman,</b> Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman</b> who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E

40|$|Aging {{influences}} the laryngeal anatomy and physiology, leading to altered vocal quality. In <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women,</b> {{the voice is}} affected {{by a combination of}} aging and menopausal transition. However, in many studies about vocal aging, the menopausal transition is not taken into account. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure and describe the effect of aging on the vocal characteristics by comparing young women (between 20 and 28 years) and <b>middle-aged</b> premenopausal <b>women</b> (between 45 and 52 years). To determine the vocal characteristics in both groups, objective (aerodynamic measurements, vocal performance measurements, acoustic analysis, and a determination of the Dysphonia Severity Index) and subjective assessment techniques (perceptual evaluation, videostroboscopic evaluation, and Voice Handicap Index) were used. The <b>middle-aged</b> premenopausal <b>women</b> showed a smaller frequency and intensity range, a lower habitual fundamental frequency, and a higher soft phonation index compared with the young women. The results of this study are important when studying the voices of <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> Vocal characteristics of <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> differ from young women, and these changes cannot only be because of hormonal changes during the menopause...|$|R

25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} some time being tutored by teacher Iordache, whom the text depicts as a drunk, a sudden outbreak of cholera kills his teacher and pushes Smaranda and Ștefan to send their child out of the village. Nică follows the path of transhumance and is assigned {{to the care of}} shepherds, but he himself falls ill with what the narrator claims was cholera, and, upon returning home with a high fever, is instantly cured with a folk remedy of vinegar and lovage. A while after, claiming insolvency, Ștefan withdraws his son from school. Owing to Smaranda's persistence, the child follows his maternal grandfather David Creangă to Broșteni, where he and his cousin Dumitru are enlisted in a more affordable establishment. This requires adaptation on the part of Nică and Dumitru, both of whom weep once their long hair is shaved off on the new teacher's orders. They are both hosted by a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>woman,</b> Irinuca, in a small house on the Bistrița, where their proximity to goats results in a scabies infection. Creangă then recounts how, while attempting to cure themselves with frequent baths in the river, he and his cousin dislodged a cliff which rolled down and tore through Irinuca's household. After leaving Broșteni in a hurry and spending a while in Borca, the two children hasten for David Creangă's home in Pipirig. After an eventful trip through the Eastern Carpathians, the two boys arrive in the village, where they are welcomed by David's wife Nastasia.

This paper sheds light {{on the impact of}} medical innovation in the form of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) on employment of <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women.</b> HRT are drugs taken by <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> to soften symptoms related to menopause. Before 2002, HRT products were among the most popular prescription drugs in America. We use the timing of the release of information of the potential hazardous effects of HRT—uncovered in 2002 by the largest randomized trials on women ever undertaken—as an instrument for the purchase of the affected drugs within a Fixed Effect Instrumental Variable framework. We find that HRT use impacts employment: namely, that HRT use increases employment by 25 percentage points among <b>middle-aged</b> <b>women</b> who would have taken HRT but who do not take HRT after the release of information of its potential hazardous effects. ...|$|R
