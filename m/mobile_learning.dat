40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} students' actual and preferred perceptions of a <b>mobile</b> enhanced <b>learning</b> environment at a tertiary institution in New Zealand and if these variations in perceptions differed based on gender and age. In order for this to be achieved, a new learning environment instrument was developed based on modifying the existing Web-based Learning Environment Instrument (WEBLEI) with scale items being modified to create the <b>Mobile</b> Enhanced <b>Learning</b> Environment Instrument (MOBLEI). A review of the literature examined learning environments and questionnaires on which the theoretical framework for this study was based. The use of <b>mobile</b> technologies in <b>learning</b> environments was provided along with a discussion around gender and age and differences between males and females and generational groups in relation to learning and technology. Students’ perceptions of their learning environment were determined through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods with open-ended questions being included in the MOBLEI, along with follow up focus groups. The MOBLEI was distributed to 141 tertiary business and computing students, and was found to be a valid and reliable tool for application in a tertiary environment in New Zealand. Results from the MOBLEI showed no significant differences between the perceptions of males and females, however younger age groups had a more positive attitude toward the use of technology than did their more mature counterparts. Overall, the study provided an insight into how students perceive a <b>mobile</b> enhanced <b>learning</b> environment, along with practical implications for education practitioners with an aim to provide direction for an ideal <b>mobile</b> enhanced <b>learning</b> environment for education practitioners in the tertiary environment...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} <b>mobile</b> butterfly-watching <b>learning</b> (BWL) system to realize outdoor independent <b>learning</b> for <b>mobile</b> learners. The <b>mobile</b> butterfly-watching <b>learning</b> system was designed in a wireless <b>mobile</b> ad-hoc <b>learning</b> environment. This is first result to provide a cognitive tool with supporting the independent learning by applying PDA with wireless communication technology to extend learning outside of the classroom. Independent learning consists of self-selection, self-determination, self-modification, and self-checking. To support independent learning, we designed useful butterfly-watching learning subsystems to offer the self-selection, self-determination, self-modification, and self-checking functionality. The study sample consisted of twenty-four five-year students who enrolled in natural science course in the Fall of 2003 in Taiwan. The study lasted fourth months (one semester). During the butterfly-watching activity, each learner arbitrarily took a distinct butterfly picture and entered it into his own PDA to acquire the butterfly knowledge anytime and anywhere through wireless communication. The potential impacts, limitations, and lessons learned from this study are discussed from both the educational and technological points of view. <b>Mobile</b> outside classroom <b>learning</b> potentially extends the scope of learning activities and with more flexibility than in traditional school curriculum. This work shows that the concept of applying PDA with wireless communication technology is a “new cognitive learning tool ” to personally access, analyze, interpret, and organize their personal knowledge anytime and anywhere...|$|R
