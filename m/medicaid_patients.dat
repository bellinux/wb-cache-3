Lynchburg Training School after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patients</b> from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v. Minnesota, a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not {{to comply with a}} state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and AIDS. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v.

25|$|As {{with the}} 2003 {{emergency}} revision budget, Medicaid funding, which {{was responsible for}} more than one-fourth of all state spending and which had been growing rapidly, was targeted for cuts in the 2004 budget. In addition to proposing reductions in payments to hospitals and nursing homes for care of <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patients,</b> and restrictions on Medicaid patients' access to prescription drugs and eligibility for nursing homes admission, Romney proposed that the low-income <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patients</b> be charged monthly fees {{for participation in the}} program, along with co-payments for visits to doctors' offices. The 2004 budget also incorporated further cuts in funding for higher education. Public colleges and universities responded to funding cuts during Romney's tenure by raising mandatory fees 63percent. Most other areas of state government were budgeted to receive approximately 5percent less funding on average.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{many states}} have {{authorized}} financial requirements {{that will make it}} more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage. In Wisconsin, nearly a quarter of <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patients</b> were dropped after the state government imposed premiums of 3% of household income.

On such an emergency timetable, there's just time for cuts.” He also proposed cuts in state expenditures for Medicaid, the government program providing {{health care for the}} poorest state residents. The cuts included caps in payments to medical providers (one example being through limiting payments for hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), increased stringency of the criteria for Medicaid eligibility, and rationing of access to higher-priced medications for <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patients.</b> Some 36,000 Massachusetts residents lost their Medicaid eligibility. The 2003 emergency budget revision proposal also included funding cuts affecting public colleges and universities, treatment for schizophrenic and other mentally ill patients, and various other social services.|$|E

50|$|The {{costs of}} {{treating}} the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as charity care, {{passed on to}} the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums, or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes. However, hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund program. Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of funds to providers. In Missouri, for example, providers assessments totaling $800 million are matched - $2 for each assessed $1 - to create a pool of approximately $2 billion. By federal law these funds are transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompenstated care including Disproportionate Share Payments (to hospitals with high quantities of uninsured <b>patients),</b> <b>Medicaid</b> shortfalls, Medicaid managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred by hospitals. In New Hampshire, by statute, reimbursable uncompensated care costs shall include: charity care costs, any portion of <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patient</b> care costs that are unreimbursed by Medicaid payments, and any portion of bad debt costs that the commissioner determines would meet the criteria under 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g) governing hospital-specific limits on disproportionate share hospital payments under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether there is a difference in PAR score changes between <b>Medicaid</b> and non-Medicaid <b>patients</b> during and after orthodontic treatment. PAR scores were determined using study models of 43 Medicaid and 39 non-Medicaid patients before and at the end of active treatment, and 24 Medicaid and 42 non-Medicaid patients at the end of treatment and at an average of 13 months post-treatment. PAR scores generally reduce during treatment and will increase if relapse occurs. Rates of PAR score change during and after treatment were compared between <b>Medicaid</b> and non-Medicaid <b>patients</b> using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The mean initial PAR score was greater in the Medicaid group (31. 95 versus 23. 28; p= 0. 003) while there was no significant difference found between the two groups for the end of treatment PAR scores (3. 22 versus 2. 93; p= 0. 451).

40|$|Previous {{studies found}} that uninsured and <b>Medicaid</b> insured cancer <b>patients</b> have poorer {{outcomes}} than cancer patients with private insurance. We examined the association between health insurance status and survival of New Jersey patients 18 - 64 diagnosed with seven common cancers during 1999 - 2004. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals for 5 -year cause-specific survival were calculated from Cox proportional hazards regression models; health insurance status was the primary predictor with adjustment for other significant factors in univariate chi-square or Kaplan-Meier survival log-rank tests. Two diagnosis periods by health insurance status were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival log-rank tests. For breast, colorectal, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and prostate cancer, uninsured and <b>Medicaid</b> insured <b>patients</b> had significantly higher risks of death than privately insured patients. For bladder cancer, uninsured patients had a significantly higher risk of death than privately insured patients. Survival improved between the two diagnosis periods for privately insured patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer and NHL, for <b>Medicaid</b> insured <b>patients</b> with NHL, {{and not at all}} for uninsured patients. Survival from cancer appears to be related to a complex set of demographic and clinical factors of which insurance status is a part.

40|$|Background: With nearly 20 % of the U.

Methods: Medicaid billing data from 2009 to 2011 were analyzed to calculate the distance and duration that a <b>Medicaid</b> <b>patient</b> population had to travel when seeking primary care in the 29 rural counties of eastern North Carolina. Primary care codes were analyzed to detect any differences in access patterns for various complexity levels of physician visits. Data were also used to evaluate health professional shortage areas (HPSA) designations in eastern North Carolina based on current federal definition. Results: There was a significant difference in patient visits when comparing HPSA-defined travel times of more or less than 20 miles or 30 minutes; however, the average patient received a sufficient number of primary care visits annually (average ~ 3) with distance and duration having limited effect on the amount of care the patients received.

Methods: Survival {{analysis was used}} to assess differences in discontinuation between ChEIs (donepezil versus rivastigmine and galantamine), and for difference in patient gender, age, race, and care setting. Results: Rates of discontinuation increased from 42. 7 % (95 % CI = 39. 9 – 45. 5) at 12 months to 84. 8 % (95 % CI = 82. 3 – 87. 3) at 24 months. In multivariate models, no signifi cant differ-ence in discontinuation existed prior to 365 days. However, patients dispensed donepezil were less likely to discontinue as compared with users of the other two ChEIs after the fi rst year (RR = 0. 70; CI = 0. 499 – 0. 983; p 0. 04). Patients of white race were less likely to discontinue (RR = 0. 549; 95 % CI = 0. 43 – 0. 82; p = 0. 0015), while gender, care setting, and age were not associated with discontinuation. Conclusions: One-year persistence rates were similar between different ChEIs.
