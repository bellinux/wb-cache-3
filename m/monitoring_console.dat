In contrast collecting and transmitting biomedical data continuously over long distances in outdoor conditions is still a challenge. In this paper we investigate {{the possibility of using}} disruption-tolerant wireless sensors to monitor the cardiac activity of runners during a marathon race, using off-the-shelf sensing devices and a limited number of base stations deployed along the marathon route. Preliminary experiments conducted with a few volunteers running around a university campus confirm that this approach is viable, and suggest that it should scale up to a real marathon...|$|E
40|$|PLCs {{are widely}} used to control and monitor {{industrial}} processes at CERN. Since these PLCs fulfill critical functions, they must be placed under permanent monitoring. However, due to their proprietary architecture, {{it is difficult to}} both monitor the status of these PLCs using vendor-provided software packages and integrate the resulting data with the CERN accelerator infrastructure, which itself relies on CERN-specific protocols. This paper describes the architecture of a stand-alone "PLC diagnostics monitoring" Linux daemon which provides live diagnostics information through standard means and protocols (file logging, CERN protocols, Java Monitoring Extensions). This information is currently consumed by the supervision software which is used by the standby service to monitor the status of critical industrial applications in the LHC and by the <b>monitoring</b> <b>console</b> used by the LHC operators. Both applications are intensively used to monitor and diagnose critical PLC hardware running all over CERN...|$|E

This research describes and analyzes a United States Navy Satellite Communications (SATCOM) performance monitoring model in providing status {{information to a}} network <b>monitoring</b> <b>console</b> to support naval operations. The environment is characterized by potentially adverse conditions that affect satellite performance. Current SATCOM systems are unable to provide performance information to the network's performance monitor {{because they are not}} Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enabled and not integrated into the routable network. A network monitoring model defined by sense, decide, and act is central to this study. It represents enhanced monitoring by the subscriber station's monitor console for naval shipboard operations. This model delivers operational and RF environmental information to the SNMP MIB environment so that commonly used SNMP agents can request and send information for sending proper messages to the network's performance monitoring system. The proposed solution is explored through analysis of existing monitoring models together with observations of a tactical networking field experiment, in which equipment {{at the edge of the}} network and subscriber's SATCOM terminal is monitored for gathering critical performance details...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{architectural}} design, implementation, configuration and integration of a cyber-security module for a supervision system. A rather standard solution has been followed for the intrusion-detection architecture, comprising a Network-based IDS and a Host-based IDS. While {{the choice of the}} HIDS has been straightforward, the selection of the NIDS required a more in-depth analysis of current technology solutions, and {{has been one of the}} main objectives of this work. The selection of the NIDS has been accomplished by first identifying a few candidate open-source tools using qualitative criteria. Then, a quantitative benchmarking has been performed in two rounds of tests, the first with a test set already used for previous older works, and the second with more specific attacks. This allowed a sound choice of the NIDS. It has been then demonstrated how the chosen tools can be integrated by normalizing their outputs to a standard format and performing correlation having a more comprehensive view of the network. Finally, the cyber-security software module that integrates the IDS architecture with the supervision system has been developed. This module processes the security alerts coming from the intrusion-detection architecture and sends them to the supervision system for displaying onto a central <b>monitoring</b> <b>console...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop an {{automated}} mechanical arm, say to serve {{a glass of water}} to an immobile patient, using a remote pressing operation. Control of the arm has been designed with limiting switches & a set of potentiometers & DC motors. Movements of different arm segments, their range & extent of movement has been pre-set with a provision for manual operations also. The robotic arm that is being developed is an inexpensive one, made out of lightweight mild grade aluminium. The arm has 3 degrees of freedom can reach and grab any object (up to 500 grams) within a span of 0. 3 meters. The motor shafts are mechanically coupled to the respective potentiometers. The analog voltages obtained from the sensors/potentiometers are fed into the programmable IC The inbuilt ADC converts these voltages to digital values. The data from the operator fed into the chip is now compared with stored reference values and appropriate signals are sent to motor driver IC's which actuate the motors to bring the claw to the specified coordinates and grip/release the object (glass). The software to control the operation is written in a high level language converted into a Hex code and burnt onto the EPROM of the PIC The computer is present for <b>monitoring</b> <b>console</b> operations...|$|E

40|$|Fish and {{fishery product}} sector plays an {{important}} role in Sri Lanka’s social and economic life. Deep sea fishing is the main occupation of over two hundred thousands of families in coastal belt. Seafood export sector has a significant scope to uplift their living standards by creating a good market demand for Sri Lankan fishery products. As the main buyer of Sri Lankan fish products, European Union enforced restrictions over Sri Lankan fishery products by demanding assurance against illegal fishing. Even though the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of Sri Lanka laid a strong foundation for a managed and controlled fishery, most of the effort fell apart due to absence of electronic vessel monitoring system. Projects initiated to introduce commercial vessel monitoring systems failed due to unbearable cost and no localization to support literacy level of Sri Lankan fishermen. This project researched on introducing an electronic vessel monitoring system to eliminate illegal fishing and maintain higher sustainability rate of marine lives while providing evidences for legal and controlled fishery in Sri Lanka. To fulfill the main objective as low cost and localized solution, the design was aimed to introduce a vessel monitoring system as an application which converts fisherman’s mobile phone into a vessel monitoring system by utilizing common features of smartphones such as GPS receiver, mobile data access, internal storage and Unicode compatibilities. Going beyond the vessel monitoring system, design was embedded E-Logbook as a separate section to records fish catch details, to be used as a good source of information which helps to maintain higher sustainability rate of marine lives by identifying feeding and breeding grounds. Administration console facilitates harbor officers to record fishing trip details while the <b>monitoring</b> <b>console</b> shows continuous vessel’s positions to overlook the trip route. Systems executes a rule based verification at the end of each fishing trip to ensure the legality of its catch and suitability of exporting to European market. System certifies the catch when the vessel have sailed only in legal zone and the catch satisfied commercial fishing regulation. Harbor officers do not release the harvest without catch certificate. That gives a good assurance of Sri Lanka compliance with international trade regulations and marine policies for sustainable fishery...|$|E
