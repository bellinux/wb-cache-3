40|$|Metabolism catalyzed by the {{cytochrome}} P 450 enzyme CYP 2 C 19 varies between individuals, who can {{be either}} efficient (EM) or poor metabolizers (PM). In this thesis the metabolism of four different CYP 2 C 19 substrates (citalopram, <b>mephenytoin,</b> omeprazole, and proguanil) was investigated in vivo in Africans (Ethiopians an Tanzanians) an in Swedish is Caucasians. PM lack the enzyme and cannot metabolize drugs that are CYP 2 C 19 substrates. The frequency of PM differs between populations. CYP 2 C 19 activity in Africans matters because the antimalarial prophylactic drug proguanil needs biotransformation by this enzyme to a metabolite, which is active against malaria. Genetic differences {{in the ability to}} metabolize drugs are to be expected between populations since humankind has gone through substantial adaptation because of mutations and genetic drift. Inherited properties to metabolize efficiently or poor has been advantageous in different environments, and survival was due to natural selection. This process has created arbitrary ethnic populations. Two screening studies of CYP 2 C 19 activity and two pharmacokinetic studies were performed. All four were in healthy subjects. The CYP 2 C 19 probe drugs <b>mephenytoin</b> and omeprazole were used for phenotyping in 251 Tanzanians, and <b>mephenytoin</b> together with debrisoquine in 106 Ethiopians living in Sweden. The pharmacokinetics, of the CYP 2 C 19 substrate proguanil was investigated in Tanzanians, and that of citalopram was studied in Swedes. CYP 2 C 19 activity was markedly lower in Tanzanians compared to Asians and Caucasians, despite that the screened mutated alleles known at that time, could not provide an explanation. However, they are unlikely to be the whole explanation. At the time of the beginning of this thesis work, the PM frequency was not extensively studied in Africans, but few reports from few populations indicated a frequency between 5 and 20 %. In Tanzanians we found a frequency of 7. 5 %, and in Ethiopians living in Sweden 4. 3 %. The decreased CYP 2 C 19 activity shown for <b>mephenytoin</b> and omeprazole hydroxylation in Tanzanians was confirmed with proguanil. The pharmacokinetics of proguanil revealed that it might not be used safely in a Tanzanian population for prophylaxis because too low concentrations of the active metabolite cycloguanil are expected when normal proguanil doses are used. The clinical implications of the slower metabolism in Tanzanians may be the need to prescribe lower doses of drugs that are CYP 2 C 19 substrates in Tanzanians compared to Caucasians and even Asians. The comparison of <b>mephenytoin</b> and debrisoquine metabolism of Ethiopians living in Sweden with previously published data, by Aklillu et al. and Persson et al. from Ethiopians living in Ethiopia, did not show any statistical difference in CYP 2 C 19 activity in Ethiopians living in Sweden compared to those who live in Ethiopia. Likewise, there was mere a trend toward a difference for the CYP 2 D 6 substrate debrisoquine (p= 0. 06). CYP 2 C 19 was found to metabolize the S-citalopram, but not R- citalopram in Swedes. Adverse drug effect monitoring in the citalopram study revealed a suggested relationship between high citalopram concentrations and hypomania and yawning. Knowledge of CYP 2 C 19 metabolism provides information for use and dosage of around twenty drugs used in treatment of malaria, epilepsy, hypertension, peptic ulcer, and in several psychiatric conditions.

Therefore, phenytoin was chosen as a model AED {{and the effect of}} CYP 2 C 9 / 2 C 19 genetic polymorphism on phenytoin metabolism was further examined. An estimation of the allele prevalence was undertaken for three CYP 2 C 9 / 2 C 19 alleles respectively using a meta-analysis of studies that fit the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The prevalence of CYP 2 C 9 * 1 is approximately 81 %, 96 %, 97 % and 94 % in Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese, African populations respectively; the pooled prevalence of CYP 2 C 19 * 1 is about 86 %, 57 %, 58 % and 85 % in these ethnic populations respectively. However, the studies of association between CYP 2 C 9 / 2 C 19 polymorphism and phenytoin metabolism failed to achieve any qualitative or quantitative conclusion. Therefore, <b>mephenytoin</b> metabolism was examined as a probe drug for association between CYP 2 C 19 polymorphism and <b>mephenytoin</b> metabolic ratio. Similarly, analysis of association between CYP 2 C 9 polymorphism and warfarin dose requirement was undertaken. It was confirmed that subjects carrying two mutated CYP 2 C 19 alleles have higher S/R <b>mephenytoin</b> ratio due to deficient CYP 2 C 19 enzyme activity. The studies of warfarin and CYP 2 C 9 polymorphism did not provide a conclusive result due to poor comparability between studies. The genetic polymorphism of drug metabolism enzymes has been studied extensively, however other genetic factors, such as multiple drug resistance genes (MDR) and genes encoding ion channels, which may contribute to variability in function of drug transporters and targets, require more attention in future pharmacogenetic studies of antiepileptic drugs.

A stereoselectivity in the metabolism of TRI has been found, with a preferential N-demethylation of (D) -TRI and a preferential hydroxylation of (L) -TRI. CYP 2 D 6 appears {{to be involved in}} the 2 -hydroxylation of (L) -TRI, (L) DTRI and (D) -DTRI, but not of (D) -TRI, as significant correlations were measured between the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratios and the (L) -TRI/(L) -TRIOH (r = 0. 45, p = 0. 019), the (L) -DTRI/(L) -DTRIOH (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 014), and the (D) -DTRI/(D) -DTRIOH (r = 0. 51, p = 0. 006), but not with the (D) -TRI/(D) -TRIOH ratios (r = 0. 29, NS). CYP 2 C 19, but not CYP 2 D 6, appears {{to be involved in the}} demethylation pathway, with a stereoselectivity toward the (D) -enantiomer of TRI, as a significant positive correlation was calculated between the <b>mephenytoin</b> (S) /(R) ratios and the concentrations to dose-to-weight ratios of (D) -TRI (r = 0. 69, p = 0. 00006). CYP 3 A 4 / 5 appears to be involved in the metabolism of (L) -TRI to a presently not determined metabolite. The CYP 2 D 6 poor metabolizer had the highest (L) -DTRI and (D) -DTRI concentrations to dose-to-weight ratios, and the CYP 2 C 19 poor metabolizer had the highest (L) -TRI and (D) -TRI concentrations to dose-to-weight ratios of the group...|$|E

In the space of 3 months he developed a rash, migrating arthralgia, and pleuritic chest pain. LE-cells and antinuclear factor were present, but disappeared along with the rash and arthralgia within 9 weeks of discontinuing the drug. This case drew attention to the role of procaina-mide in inducing a condition resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

40|$|A gas chromatographic {{method in}} which an on-col-umn {{reaction}} with a methylating reagent is used has been developed that permits the simultaneous deter-mination of plasma concentrations of carbamaz#{ 233 }pine and of some other commonly co-administered anti-convulsant drugs, including phenobarbital, diphenyl-hydantoin, primidone, and <b>mephenytoin.</b> As littleas 0. 5 t 9 {{of any of these}} drugs can be determined per milliliter of plasma. Patients with convulsive disorders treated with carbamazepine are often given simultaneously such drugs as prim idone, mephobarbital, diphenylhydant-oin, phenobarbital, or <b>mephenytoin.</b> Therapeutic concentrations of carbamazepine probably vary be-tween 2 and 10 tg/ml of plasma. The importance of monitoring anticonvulsant concentrations in blood is now widely recognized (1). Several gas-chromato-graphic methods have been described for the analysis of the barbiturates and hydantoins (1 - 5). Carbama-zepine has usually been determined spectrophotome-trically (6 - 8), but three gas-chromatographic meth-ods have been described for its analysis (9 - 11), none of which is conveniently applicable to the simulta-neous determination of the above-mentioned anti-convulsants. It would be highly desirable to be able to measure selectively, in a single assay, the concentrations of all of these commonly used anticonvulsant drugs pres-ent in a human plasma sample. The following report describes such a method, in which on-column meth-ylation is used. The method is suitable for the simul-tarleous determination of carbamazepine and all of the above-mentioned drugs. In this method, carbam-aepine is measured as its decomposition product, dibenze[b,f]azepine (iminostilbene) ...|$|E

Ther. 221 : 228 - 234, 1982. Anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy with the hydantoin phenytoin carries {{a risk of}} teratologic sequelae and develop-mental retardation known as the fetal hydantoin syndrome. The putative teratogen is a highly reactive arene oxide intermediate produced during phenytoin metabolism.

40|$|Two {{published}} {{case reports}} showed that addition of risperidone (1 and 2 mg/d) to a clozapine treatment {{resulted in a}} strong increase of clozapine plasma levels. As clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P 450 isozymes, a study was initiated to assess the in vivo interaction potential of risperidone on various cytochrome P 450 isozymes. Eight patients were phenotyped with dextromethorphan (CYP 2 D 6), <b>mephenytoin</b> (CYP 2 C 19), and caffeine (CYP 1 A 2) {{before and after the}} introduction of risperidone. Before risperidone, all eight patients were phenotyped as being extensive metabolizers of CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19. Risperidone at dosages between 2 and 6 mg/d does not appear to significantly inhibit CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 C 19 in vivo (median plasma paraxanthine/caffeine ratios before and after risperidone: 0. 65, 0. 69; p = 0. 89; median urinary (S) /(R) <b>mephenytoin</b> ratios before and after risperidone: 0. 11, 0. 12; p = 0. 75). Although dextromethorphan metabolic ratio is significantly increased by risperidone (median urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratios before and after risperidone: 0. 010, 0. 018; p = 0. 042), risperidone can be considered a weak in vivo CYP 2 D 6 inhibitor, as this increase is modest and none of the eight patients was changed from an extensive to a poor metabolizer. The reported increase of clozapine concentrations by risperidone can therefore not be explained by an inhibition of CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 C 19 or by any combination of the three UR - [URL]...|$|E
