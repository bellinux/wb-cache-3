5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through <b>mechanical</b> <b>cues,</b> vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E

Here we show that extracellular matrix compliance and cell contractility are two opposing determinants for oestrogen output of adipose stromal cells.

50|$|Both microfilaments and microtubules play {{major roles}} in mechanotransduction. In the actin cytoskeleton, mechanotransduction can occur at cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesions, through focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. Transduction of {{forces from the}} outside {{to the inside of}} the cell can control the {{maturation}} or disassembly of adhesions, and initiate intracellular signalling cascades that can alter cellular behaviours, and cells are known to assemble stress fibers when they encounter mechanical stress. For example, cells that are grown on rigid substrates will show thick stress fibers, whereas the stress fibers seen in cells grown on softer substrates will be less pronounced. The mechanical force transmitted to focal adhesions by stress fibers can also alter the conformation of mechanosensitive focal adhesion proteins, such as p130Cas and talins, suggesting that stress fiber contractility may translate mechanical signals into biochemical cues. There are also a small subset of focal adhesion-associated integrins that terminate in the perinuclear actin cap (at the top of the nucleus), and are anchored there by the LINC complex. These cap-associated focal adhesions have been established as major mediators in mechanosensing, and represent a direct pathway for the transduction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>cues</b> from focal adhesions to the nucleus.|$|E

Here, we describe a mechanism for modulating vascular cells during sequential stages of an in vitro model of early angiogenesis by applying cyclic tensile strain. Cyclic strain of human umbilical vein (HUV) ECs up-regulated the secretion of angiopoietin (Ang) - 2 and PDGF-ββ, and enhanced endothelial migration and sprout formation, whereas effects were eliminated with shRNA knockdown of endogenous Ang- 2. Applying strain to colonies of HUVEC, cocultured on the same micropatterned substrate with nonstrained human aortic (HA) SMCs, led to a directed migration of the HASMC toward migrating HUVECs, with diminished recruitment when PDGF receptors were neutralized.

In this study, we used an integrated microfluidic perfusion device to simultaneously generate multiple-parameter fluid shear stresses to investigate the role of fluid flow stimuli in the regulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression and the fates of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and primary chondrocytes. YAP expression was regulated by the level of fluid flow stimulus in both MSCs and chondrocytes.

However, existing studies have not systematically isolated the requisite geometric parameters for suppression of myofibroblast differentiation via microtopography, and {{there has not been}} in vivo validation of this technology to date. To address these issues, a novel lamination method was developed to afford more control over topography dimensions. Specifically, in this study we focus on fiber length and its effect on myofibroblast differentiation. Fibroblasts cultured on films with microfibers exceeding 16 μm in length lost the characteristic morphology associated with myofibroblast differentiation, while shorter microfibers of 6 μm length failed to produce this phenotype. This increase in length corresponded to a 50 % decrease in fiber stiffness, which acts as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>cue</b> to influence myofibroblast differentiation. Longer microfiber films suppressed expression of myofibroblast specific genes (αSMA, Col 1 α 2, and Col 3 α 1) and TGFβ signaling components (TGFβ 1 ligand, TGFβ receptor II, and Smad 3). 16 μm long microfiber films implanted subcutaneously in a mouse wound-healing model generated a substantially thinner fibrotic capsule and less deposition of collagen in the wound bed.
