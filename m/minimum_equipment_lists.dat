25|$|Before the flight, {{the crew}} {{found that one}} of the two main power {{generators}} was defective since 6 September, and the mechanic who inspected the aircraft was unable to repair it. In the Norwegian jurisdiction an aircraft is only allowed to take off if it has two operable sources of power. Also the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> required two operating generators. The first officer decided that he would run the auxiliary power unit (APU) throughout the flight so that the flight would have two sources of power and therefore be allowed to leave.|$|R
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> item) because of technical {{problems with the}} thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{aircraft}} {{are designed to}} be fault-tolerant. Current maintenance systems provide diagnosis of existing faults, capabilities to do trend monitoring, but no information about the real-time remaining tolerance margin knowing the existing faults, and regarding next incoming MMEL (Master <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List)</b> items that impact aircraft dispatch capabilities. This paper presents a new concept of aircraft preventive diagnosis based on failure conditions graphs with the associated logical framework. The complete method was successfully applied by Airbus on A 380 use cases. The first part of the present paper gives the formal logical definitions for the aircraft preventive diagnosis and remaining margin, distance, risk rate. The second part gives an application example based on the landing gear system of an aircraft and also the lessons learnt from Airbus on A 380. Finally, the last section provides a logical integration of preventive diagnosis with prognosis that opens new perspectives. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Following another air {{disaster}} killing 13 {{people on}} 18 March 1998, Formosa Airlines was grounded until 1 April, {{as it was}} determined that the pilots had not complied with the standard operating procedure. The Saab 340 (registered B-12255) with eight passengers and five crew members on board crashed a few minutes into a scheduled passenger flight from Hsinchu to Kaohsiung, at 19:32 local time. During the pre-flight check, the pilots had noticed that several systems were unavailable, including the autopilot and electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). Violating the <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list,</b> according to which the aircraft should have been considered to be in a non-flyable condition, the pilots decided to take-off nevertheless. In flight, the aircraft proved to behave in an unpredicted way, as the leading edges of the wings could not be kept at equal temperatures because of the failing bleed air supply, causing a loss of control.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{motive to}} use the iPad as a {{navigation}} tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include aircraft flight manuals, approach plates, navigation charts, policy manuals, <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> and taxi charts. Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates {{to a lot of}} paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy flight bag. It would be replaced by the 9.5 inch by 7.31 inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of kneeboards. Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{procedural}} guidelines for delayed damage aircraft safe flights. This methodological support {{is intended to}} form the aircraft type <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> (MEL). It is suggested to use airworthiness provision as the basic criterion for MEL determination. In order to develop methodological support of safe flights with delayed damage it is suggested to follow the well-known methods of statistical and constructive analyses and theory of estimation methods. Functional system reliability of delayed damage flights isanalyzed alongside with functional system failure types and consequences. Modeling reckons upon the opportunity to analyze the functional system failure-free operation for any predetermined specified operation time, including the time between overhauls. Functional system failure-free operation analyses and estima- tion by means of suggested model supposes step-by-step approach in solvation of the following problems: every component of the functional system reliability estimation; failure-free operation of the functional system in the whole. Thus {{it is possible to}} determine and forecast acceptable rates of failure probability for every analyzed component considering airworthiness requirements at the aircraft maintenance facility. The initial data for modeling is the functional systems and parts failure statistic database accumulated from a cer- tain maintenance facility operation experience. The suggested mathematical support for MEL formation allows to update manufacturer specified MEL for the air-craft maintenance facility...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a decision support tool for unplanned maintenance of aircraft at ramp time during airport operations. Ramp time is the time between an aircraft arrival and its next departure. Clearance of an aircraft for flight is controlled by aviation regulations. Therefore decisions regarding maintenance are taken by engineers who have to comply with the regulations that are governed outside the organizational structure of the airline. Unplanned maintenance also often disrupts the normal operational scheduling and leads to significant costs. Therefore, the decision support tool must include the relevant aviation regulations, be capable of rescheduling to minimise disruption and be able to optimise solutions based on cost. In this project an aircraft schedule is used to demonstrate the procedures. An assumed fleet of six airplanes fly between three cities. Consultation with aviation experts ensured the size of the fleet and operations are realistic. A regulation database was developed based on the Master <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> (MMEL) for the aircraft, and a computer programme was developed to provide different options that comply with the regulations and take into account scheduling disruption and costs. In certain cases the regulations allow an aircraft to fly with some components inoperable so long as backup systems can perform the tasks. It is possible then to postpone the maintenance until the aircraft arrives at a properly equipped airport, or until a longer scheduled stopover reduces the disruption to operations. To address the engineering aspects of the project, maintenance of a single component that appears in the MMEL for the chosen aircraft is considered. To plan maintenance following a failure, the cause of the failure needs to be identified. Only then can the resources and time required to repair the defect be defined. The programme validation has confirmed it is able to balance different aspects of decisions related to unplanned aircraft ramp maintenance. Although the programme is based on an assumed fleet operation, the structure of the programme will allow it to be applied to other fleet and route configurations...|$|R
