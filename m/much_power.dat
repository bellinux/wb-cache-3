However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas became {{governor}} of Buenos Aires after the {{brief period of}} anarchy {{following the end of}} the Cisplatine War in 1828. In theory, Rosas only held as <b>much</b> <b>power</b> as governors of the other Argentine provinces, but in reality he ruled over the entire Argentine Confederation, as the country was then known. Although {{he was one of the}} Federalists, a faction which demanded greater provincial autonomy, in practice Rosas exercised control over the other provinces and become the virtual dictator of Argentina. During his 20-year government, the country witnessed the resurgence of armed conflicts between the Unitarians (his rival political faction) and the Federalists.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying is {{a winter}} sport {{discipline}} derived from ski jumping, in which much greater distances can be achieved. It {{is a form}} of competitive Nordic skiing where athletes descend individually at very fast speeds along a specially built takeoff ramp using skis only; jump from the end of it with as <b>much</b> <b>power</b> as they can generate; then glide – or 'fly' – as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill; and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner. Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges, and events are governed by the International Ski Federation (FIS).|$|E
5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks {{a fine line between}} good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as <b>much</b> <b>power</b> as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E

5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred <b>much</b> <b>power</b> {{to the high}} and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily {{to the collapse of}} the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E

5|$|Barquq was {{restored}} {{to power in}} 1390, after which the Turkmen tribesmen raided the hills around Beirut once more, although {{they were unable to}} capture the villages of Ainab and Aramoun. Under Barquq's direction, the Mamluks mobilized their army troops, Druze warriors, and tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and dealt a heavy blow against the Turkmens of Keserwan. Nonetheless, Barquq decided to keep the Turkmen emirs as the lords of Keserwan, albeit in a weakened state. Barquq likely kept the Turkmens in place to avoid giving the Buhturids too <b>much</b> <b>power</b> in Mount Lebanon or to avoid over-extending Buhturid forces. According to Salibi, only four Turkmen emirs have been named in primary sources: a certain Sa'id who ruled in 1361, his brother and successor Isa, and a certain Ali ibn al-A'ma and his brother Umar ibn al-A'ma. The latter two were the Turkmen emirs involved in the rebellion against Barquq. Ali was killed in Barquq's punitive expedition, while Umar was imprisoned and released.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne's {{first appeal}} to royal {{authority}} in the dispute, which complained both that the lands in the Maryland charter were not really unsettled, as the charter claimed, and that the charter gave so <b>much</b> <b>power</b> to Calvert that it undermined {{the rights of the}} settlers, was rejected by the Lords of Foreign Plantations in July 1633. The following year, the main body of Calvert's settlers arrived in the Chesapeake and established a permanent settlement on Yaocomico lands at St. Mary's City. With the support of the Virginia establishment, Claiborne made clear to Calvert that his allegiance was to Virginia and royal authority, and not to the proprietary authority in Maryland. Some historical reports claim that Claiborne tried to incite the natives against the Maryland colonists by telling them that the settlers at St. Mary's were actually Spanish and enemies of the English, although this claim has never been proven. In 1635, a Maryland commissioner named Thomas Cornwallis swept the Chesapeake for illegal traders and captured one of Claiborne's pinnaces in the Pocomoke Sound. Claiborne tried to recover it by force, but was defeated; although he retained his settlement on Kent Island. These were the first naval battles in North American waters, on 23 April and 10 May 1635; three Virginians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about {{a young man who}} is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too <b>much</b> <b>power</b> to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E
5|$|Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – April 22, 1842) was an Irish-born Catholic {{bishop in}} the United States. He became {{a priest in}} 1776 and served in that {{capacity}} in Ireland {{for more than four}} decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him Archbishop of Armagh, the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second Bishop of Philadelphia in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated William Hogan, a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too <b>much</b> <b>power</b> to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his coadjutor bishop, Francis Kenrick. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.|$|E

5|$|In 1779, the {{congregation}} of Hanley Wesleyan Chapel were {{expelled from the}} chapel for supporting Alexander Kilham. Kilham denounced the Methodist conference for giving too <b>much</b> <b>power</b> to church ministers, at the expensive of the laity; his disagreements led to a schism in the Methodist church and his founding of the Methodist New Connexion. In Hanley, the New Connexion congregation, foremost led by William Smith, Job Meigh and George and John Ridgway, initially met {{in the house of}} one of its prominent members, and then acquired a coach-house at the corner of Albion Street that was converted into a meeting house. During the following year the first chapel was built on the site with seating for 600people. It was formally opened by Wiliam Thom, the first president of the New Connexion, and Alexander Kilham, its secretary. This chapel {{was the head of the}} Hanley Circuit, and by 1812 this Circuit was the strongest in the New Connexion. During the previous year the chapel had been expanded to seat 1,000. It was still too small for the size of {{the congregation}} and was demolished and replaced by the present chapel in 1819.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, exhausted by recent {{events such as}} World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor {{the reliability of the}} British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The Muslim majorities, who disagreed with the idea of single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try to reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with <b>much</b> <b>power</b> given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Khrushchev's ousting, three members were {{elected to the}} Presidium: Alexander Shelepin, the Chairman of the State Control Commission; Petro Shelest, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine; and Kirill Mazurov, a First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. While Brezhnev may have been General Secretary, {{he did not have}} a majority in the Presidium; when Kosygin and Podgorny agreed on policy, which was not often the case, Brezhnev found himself in the minority. Brezhnev could only count on three to four votes in the Presidium: Suslov, who often switched sides, Kirilenko, Pelše and Dmitry Polyansky. Brezhnev and Kosygin often disagreed on policy; Brezhnev was a conservative while Kosygin was a modest reformer. Kosygin, who had begun his premiership as Brezhnev's equal, lost <b>much</b> <b>power</b> and influence within the Presidium when he introduced the 1965–1971 Soviet economic reform.|$|E

In order to gain as <b>much</b> <b>power</b> as possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army.

It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became creatures of Darkness.

5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too <b>much</b> <b>power</b> over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
