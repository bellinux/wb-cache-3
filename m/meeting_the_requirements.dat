5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 miles an hour (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America.|$|E
5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the best two of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, {{that there were many}} unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the specification, the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E

In 1986, Hughes stated that the rocket could be operational by the 1990s, with launches beginning two years after project go-ahead; however the U.S. Air Force rejected the Hughes-Boeing proposal. Consideration was given to continuing the Jarvis project as a private venture, and the Jarvis was mentioned as <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> for a launch vehicle {{to be used in the}} establishment of a lunar base in a 1992 conference on the subject, however nothing further came of the proposal, while the entire Advanced Launch System development effort was scaled back into the National Launch System before being cancelled in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Before 1987, {{many cities}} were created without any plebiscites {{conducted}} for the residents to ratify the city charter, most notable of which were cities that were incorporated during the early American colonial period (Manila and Baguio), and during the Commonwealth Era (1935–1946) such as Cavite City, Dansalan (now Marawi), Iloilo City, Bacolod, San Pablo and Zamboanga City.
