I <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come.

25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them...

It doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other. I mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} notable for its sheer {{amount of water}} and its lack of bright lighting. Director Rob Bowman noted {{that he did not}} film [...] "{{anything}} for that episode during daylight, or with anything brighter than a flashlight or an emergency lamp in the hallway". [...] Bowman explained that [...] "Agua Mala" [...] was extremely difficult to film because every time a crew or cast member got wet, they [...] "had to stop everything to dry them off". Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, in particular, were [...] "water-logged" [...] for a majority of the episode's filming. Anderson later joked, [...] "I <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> got drenched. It was like we were back in Vancouver!" [...] The show had previously filmed in Vancouver from season one to five before moving to Los Angeles, California, {{at the beginning of the}} sixth season.|$|E

In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions will be helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band's last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album. According to Inez, the band is not currently signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. [...] "This , we're not sure where it's gonna land...

They, and by they I <b>mean</b> <b>we,</b> also got a clear explanation of how the islanders got onto the island. You wanted answers, you got them." [...] Sweeney also believed Davies's acting was the [...] "high point" [...] of the episode. David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented that it was a [...] "good" [...] episode, though he was [...] "bummed" [...] to see Daniel go. Oliver also said that while the episode did [...] "very little" [...] to advance the season storyline significantly, there were [...] "some significant" [...] developments and revelations in it. TV Verdict's Stephen Lackey said the episode was [...] "fast paced" [...] and featured [...] "one exciting twist after another".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} a thing as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to <b>mean.</b> <b>We</b> put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Arkham Knight had received a [...] "Mature" [...] rating from the ESRB, rather than the [...] "Teen" [...] ratings previous installments in the franchise held.

But that doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> changed our approach. We're not including gratuitous blood or swearing. We want to deliver a true end with no compromises, and it takes us to some dark places." [...] Although he did not elaborate which content in particular triggered the [...] "M" [...] rating, Hill did note that a [...] "ratings analysis" [...] by Warner Bros. indicated that the content of certain [...] "key" [...] scenes in the game could affect its rating. The team decided to maintain the offending content so that it would not [...] "jeopardize" [...] their vision for the game and its thematics. In an in-depth explanation of the game's content, the ESRB revealed the existence of scenes where players can [...] "shoot unarmed characters and a hostage", and torture scenes taking place on a [...] "bloody operating table" [...] as well as using a vehicle's wheel.|$|E
