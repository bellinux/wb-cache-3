5|$|Oogonia {{development}} in teleosts fish {{varies according to}} the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of <b>maturation</b> and fertilization processes. Changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte <b>maturation</b> process.|$|E
5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of {{the virus}} particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called <b>maturation)</b> occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and <b>maturation,</b> preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional <b>maturation</b> and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell <b>maturation</b> and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Shepton Mallet came to {{international}} attention when Westcountry Farmhouse Cheesemakers broadcast the <b>maturation</b> of {{a round of}} Cheddar cheese called Wedginald, an event that attracted more than 1.5 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} cell types {{usually have a}} single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the <b>maturation</b> of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{decided to}} use Pather Panchali (1928), the classic Bildungsroman of Bengali literature, {{as the basis for}} his first film. The semi-autobiographical novel {{describes}} the <b>maturation</b> of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the rapid}} growth phase {{suggests}} the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual <b>maturation</b> while still actively growing {{appears to be a}} shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals, such as humans and elephants. This pattern of relatively early sexual <b>maturation</b> differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>maturation</b> or {{remodeling}} phase, as {{the cells}} lining the piercing strengthen and stabilize. This stage takes {{months or years}} to complete.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the <b>maturation</b> of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
5|$|Males’ sexual <b>maturation</b> is {{triggered}} by an increased proportion {{of light in}} the photoperiod, such that they are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. More specifically, a day length of 16h is required for the weevils to terminate their reproductive diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{can live}} 70 years or more. They are {{a prime example}} of a species that has been K-selected, meaning their {{reproductive}} strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow <b>maturation,</b> and high longevity.|$|E
5|$|The album {{represented}} {{a turning point}} in the musical <b>maturation</b> of the band, after a turbulent period of personnel changes in which it shrank from a six-man ensemble to a quartet. Working with the Furs for the first time, Todd Rundgren placed his own sonic imprint upon the album as producer and guest musician. Rundgren also added new types of instrumentation to the band's sound, including cello and marimba.|$|E
5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding affinity. Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity <b>maturation.</b> Affinity <b>maturation</b> occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E
5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of <b>maturation,</b> an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} mineral, including to prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people {{in the developing world}} and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual <b>maturation,</b> infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally <b>maturation.</b> The staging of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maturation</b> (remodeling): During <b>maturation</b> and remodeling, {{collagen}} is realigned along tension lines, and {{cells that}} are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|AAS use in {{adolescents}} quickens bone <b>maturation</b> and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone {{are used in}} the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken <b>maturation</b> rather than increasing adult height.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for <b>maturation</b> and maintenance of the vagina and uterus, and are also involved in ovarian function, such as <b>maturation</b> of ovarian follicles. In addition, estrogens {{play an important role}} in regulation of gonadotropin secretion. For these reasons, estrogens are required for female fertility.|$|E

25|$|Although {{generally}} {{considered part of}} the process of puberty, pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of <b>maturation</b> of the gonads that leads to sexual <b>maturation</b> and fertility. Pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and nonfunctional.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies show}} that Notch can {{influence}} neurite development. In vivo, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts neuronal <b>maturation</b> in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these findings suggest Notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal <b>maturation.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} spent in the <b>maturation</b> chamber, nanoprobes are {{introduced}} into the child's body along with cybernetic implants which are either surgically implanted or constructed by the nanoprobes. The child's physical age is also accelerated. When the children emerge from the <b>maturation</b> chambers, they have physically grown into adult drones, being no different from a drone that was already an adult when assimilated.|$|E

25|$|Deficiency of Vitamin K {{may also}} {{contribute}} to bleeding disorders because clotting factor <b>maturation</b> depends on Vitamin K.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are a second source for steroid hormones. Adrenal <b>maturation,</b> termed adrenarche, {{typically}} precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.|$|E
25|$|The thymus also secretes {{hormones and}} cytokines that {{regulate}} the <b>maturation</b> of T cells, including thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosins.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the <b>maturation</b> of the second wave, movies {{increasingly}} were being shot on video for home release.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Brooks {{held that}} Holden's {{attitude}} remains unchanged at story's end, implying no <b>maturation,</b> thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction.|$|E
25|$|Early {{stages of}} male {{hypothalamic}} <b>maturation</b> {{seem to be}} very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.|$|E
25|$|In dense {{populations of}} {{northern}} red-backed voles, sexual <b>maturation</b> of young females may be delayed, {{or they may}} migrate to a vacant breeding space.|$|E
25|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{flowering}} occurs from June through September and berry <b>maturation</b> from August to October, {{depending on}} the latitude, altitude, and climate.|$|E
25|$|A fruit {{results from}} <b>maturation</b> {{of one or}} more flowers, and the gynoecium of the flower(s) forms {{all or part of the}} fruit.|$|E
