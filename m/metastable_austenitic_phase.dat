All the <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> Fe- 18 Cr- 10 Mn-N alloys exhibited a ductile-brittle transition behavior by unusual low-temperature brittle fracture, irrespective of Cu and/or Ni addition, and deformation-induced martensitic transformation occasionally occurred during Charpy impact testing at lower temperatures due to reduced austenite stability resulting from insufficient N content. The formation of deformation-induced martensite substantially increased the ductile-brittle transition temperature(DBTT) by deteriorating low-temperature toughness because the martensite was more brittle than the parent austenite phase beyond the energy absorbed during transformation, and its volume fraction was too small. On the other hand, the Cu addition to the <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> Fe- 18 Cr- 10 Mn-N alloy increased DBTT because the presence of δ-ferrite had {{a negative effect on}} low-temperature toughness. However, the combined addition of Cu and Ni to the <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> Fe- 18 Cr- 10 Mn-N alloy decreased DBTT, compared to the sole addtion of Ni or Cu. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} the combined addition of Cu and Ni largely enhanced austenite stability, and suppressed the formation of deformation-induced martensite and δ-ferrite in conjunction with the beneficial effect of Cu which may increase stacking fault energy, so that it allows cross-slip to occur and thus reduces the planarity of the deformation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|<b>Metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steels {{are used in}} many applications, from shavers and kitchen sinks to various applications in the food industry. The diversity in applications {{of this type of}} steels is possible due to the many positive properties of the steel. It is not only esthetically pleasing, it also has a good corrosive and wear resistance, it is easy to clean and it does not support biofilm growth as well as other steels. Besides the benefits of using austenitic {{stainless steels}} in products, also some benefits can be found during the production of the products: these types of steel are easily deformable, but also have a high strength. These contradicting properties can both be found in the steel because of a phase change occurring during deformation. The <b>austenitic</b> <b>phase,</b> which is soft and easily deformable, can transform into the martensite phase, which is harder and less deformable compared to the austenite. Accompanying the transformation is a transformation strain, witch improves the deformability of the steel even further. A downside of the steel is the complex material behavior and the complicated modeling of this behavior. Models of production processes are often used to determine the optimal process conditions to obtain the desired dimensions, mechanical properties and the lowest cost price of a product. The accuracy of these models depends greatly on the accuracy of the material model describing the deformation process of the steel. The development of an accurate model describing the deformation of a <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel is not easily done. While several models exist which can describe various, relatively straight forward proportional experiments performed on austenitic steels, none can describe the correct behavior of the steel at more complex strain paths, which commonly occur during the production of a product. Two examples of areas in which the current models need to be improved are the relation between the transformation behavior of the steel, preferred orientations of the austenite grains –texture– and the strain direction as well as the influence of a changing strain path –non-proportional strain– on the transformation. These effects cannot be observed during standard experiments used to determine the parameters for the currently existing material models, but do occur during the deformation process of a product. In this research these effects on transformation of austenitic stainless steels were investigated. The results from this research can be used to develop new, more accurate material models. The material behavior during the deformation in various directions of two <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless steels, one with and one without a crystallographic texture, were investigated. Both steels show transformation during deformation, but while transformation in the textured material dependeds on the deformation direction, in the untextured steel it does not. Investigating the austenitic texture after deformation and transformation shows that the orientation of an austenite grain with respect to the stress has a strong influence on the transformation properties of the grain. Several models are presented which can predict this behavior. The influence of a non-monotonic strain path on the transformation is studied by applying various subsequent strain paths on a steel specimen. In this research, most attention has been paid on a strain path containing a strain reversal. It is shown that, besides the classical Bauschinger effect –the decrease in flow stress after a load reversal–, also the transformation behavior, and thus the material behavior, changes significantly after the strain reversal. The similar effect has been observed during non-proportional strain paths. This research shows that the current material models describing the material behavior of <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless steels during deformation, can be improved.

In {{order to understand}} the formability of the experimental alloys, the tensile behaviour of the alloys is characterised. The tensile properties of <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless steels are governed by austenite stability which is related to alloy composition and test temperature. At certain alloy compositions, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) occurs. TRIP depends on the manner in which deformation induced martensite forms in the steels. Incipient necking is resisted if the martensite forms gradually and selectively, preventing propagation of micronecks and microcracks. Tensile tests performed from - 5 to 100 °C were used to study the effect of TRIP on the ductility of these alloys and optimum tensile properties were obtained at room temperature. In addition, the effect of copper on TRIP and subsequently formability were ascertained using copper alloyed stainless steels. Important stretch formability parameters were obtained from the tensile test which is an intrinsic formability test. TRIP results in improved formability of <b>metastable</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless steels, and a simulative Engelhardt test was performed to ascertain the effect of TRIP on drawability of the test alloys. It was found that alloys with TRIP characteristics exhibited good drawability and in all cases the test alloys had better limiting drawing ratios than AISI 304 stainless steel. Delayed cracking occurred in alloys with more than 0. 2 percent nitrogen content and a low austenite stability, probably as a result of embrittlement of the deformation induced martensite by nitrogen.
