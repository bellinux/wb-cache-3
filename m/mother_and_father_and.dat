25|$|Another {{evolutionary}} hypothesis for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia {{is the idea}} of ensuring pair-bonding between the <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> paternal investment in the fetus. Researchers posit that pre-eclampsia is an adaptation for the mother to terminate investment in a fetus that might have an unavailable paternal donor, as determined by repeated semen exposure of the paternal donor to the mother. Various studies have shown that women who frequently had exposure to partners’ semen before conception had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia. Also, subsequent pregnancies by the same paternal donor had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia while subsequent pregnancies by a different paternal donor had a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|The most mature {{pictures}} of Kraljević's creative period were produced {{while he was}} in Požega: Krave na paši (Cows at Pasture), Bik (Bull), and U staji (In the Stables). Broad strokes and sharp contrasts of color show the artist in his natural element, the countryside, rather than the bourgeois parlor atmosphere. Also in Požega, he painted one of his best-known and finest self-portraits: Self-portrait with Dog. There he created and anthological works of Croatian art, such as Portret tete Luike (Portrait of Aunt Luike), Djevojčica s lutkom (Girl with Dolls) and portraits of his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> the poetic landscape painted with impressionistic atmosphere. His work contains elements of both Impressionism (for example in Park Luxembourg), and Expressionism (Women in the Park). His pipe pictures, also created in Paris, show methods similar to Cézanne.|$|E
25|$|Now <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son are all separated. But {{the reader}} or {{listener}} knows {{that they will}} be reunited {{at the end of the}} tale, for this is a romance; in essence a comedy, not a tragedy. The baby boy is carried to the kingdom of Israel, where the griffin is spotted landing, stork-like, with the baby. News of this is brought to the king, the child is named Degarébel and he is raised as the king’s son. And his mother, in fact, suffers a curiously similar fate. Having set off again from the rock of seagulls, she is carried in the boat by wind and tide until she is washed ashore in Egypt where she is found by the king of that country. She tells him who she is and is informed by the King of Egypt that she is his niece. Quite quickly, as the tale proceeds, she becomes his daughter, in a plotting device that, although clearly inconsistent with the beginning of the tale, has similarities with a new identity, following separation, taken by Emare, and by Sir Degare, by the boy Florent in the romance Octavian and by the blacksmith Sir Isumbras. Fifteen years pass before she is made the high-ranking prize at a tournament for would-be suitors.|$|E

25|$|Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) {{works with}} her parents (Gina McKee and Rob Brydon) at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors {{determine}} that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area {{and two of the}} performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine (Jason Barry), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} affairs in which the child did not have this {{relationship}} he termed [...] "maternal deprivation". This term covered a range from almost complete deprivation, not uncommon in institutions, residential nurseries and hospitals, to partial deprivation where the mother, or mother substitute, was unable to give the loving care a small child needs, to mild deprivation where the child {{was removed from the}} mother's care but was looked after by someone familiar whom he trusted. Complete or almost complete deprivation could [...] "entirely cripple the capacity to make relationships". Partial deprivation could result in acute anxiety, depression, neediness and powerful emotions which the child could not regulate. The end product of such psychic disturbance could be neurosis and instability of character. However, the main focus of the monograph was on the more extreme forms of deprivation. The focus was the child's developing relationships with his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> disturbed parent–child relationships in the context of almost complete deprivation rather than the earlier concept of the [...] "broken home" [...] as such.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the impact of children’s Phenylketonuria (PKU) on <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> to assess the mutual influence of the psychological functioning of one parent on the other. Thirty-three <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> thirty-three <b>fathers</b> of PKU-affected children <b>and</b> 43 <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> 43 <b>fathers</b> of non-PKU-affected children were involved. All of the parents filled out the Los Angeles Symptoms Checklist, the Profile of Mood Scale, the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, and the Coping Health Inventory for Parents. We performed parametric intergroup analysis and multiple regressions. Results pointed out that there is a link between maternal stress and maternal negative states of mind, trauma-related symptoms, and paternal coping strategies. As regard fathers, there is a link between paternal stress and maternal trauma-related symptoms. Our findings suggest it will be important to better investigate the role played by paternal response in supporting mothers of a chronically ill child, since they confirm the importance of taking into account the points of view of both <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> their mutual influences in responding to PKU diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Parental {{discipline}} strategies {{represent an}} important child-rearing component. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether there is a relation between different discipline strategies of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children’s prosocial behaviour, and to investigate the moderating role of child gender in this relation. Method. The research sample consisted of 100 couples (<b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers)</b> <b>and</b> their three-year-old child. Parents filled in a questionnaire about their child’s tendency towards empathic prosocial behaviour. Parental discipline styles (distraction and physical interference) and child prosocial behaviour were measured through home-based observations. Results. Findings revealed that maternal physical discipline negatively predicted child prosocial behaviour in the presence of the father. Children displayed less prosocial behaviour in the presence of their father when mothers showed more physical discipline. Furthermore, parental physical discipline and distraction were positively related to empathy and prosocial behaviour in boys. Boys were rated as more empathic when fathers showed more physical discipline, and they displayed more prosocial behaviour in the presence of their father when fathers exhibited more distraction. For girls no such relation was found. Discussion. Boys and girls appeared to be differential susceptible for parental distraction and physical discipline strategies, <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> may affect boys’ <b>and</b> girls’ prosocial behaviour differently. From these findings recommendations for clinical practice can be made, such as involving both <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> in prevention <b>and</b> intervention programs for especially boys with early social-emotional developmental problems. Future longitudinal research is necessary to gain information about particularly distraction as a positive discipline strategy and its impact on young children’s prosocial behaviour...|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonian) {{understanding}} is that Christ is [...] "One Nature—the Logos Incarnate, of the full humanity and full divinity".

2500|$|He {{was painted}} {{at least twice}} as a boy by Adolfo Müller-Ury, who was a close friend of his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> who had acted as an usher at their wedding in New York in February 1898, and who, along with the other ushers, had been given a gold {{cigarette}} box by 'Carlo' Seilern by way of thanks. The first portrait was in a group portrait with his two brothers which was certainly painted in London in the summer of 1906 and was exhibited at Knoedler in New York in December that year. The New York Herald, December 5, 1906, called the group 'graceful' and on December 8, 1906 commented that '...The boys are about 4, 6, and 7 years in age, and they have been painted out of doors.' [...] The second was in late 1906, a full-length dressed in ermine with a rabbit on a string (first exhibited in January 1907 at Knoedler and in February 1908 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC). Both are unlocated. A head and shoulders of Antoine peeping out from behind a red curtain and dated 1909 was in his possession at Princes Gate at his death in 1978 and is now in a private collection in Austria; {{what appears to be a}} reduced version of the full-length portrait survives in a private collection in Lucerne, Switzerland; the group portrait is only known through photographs.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National Organization for Marriage, argue that children do best when {{raised by a}} <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to {{the best interests of}} children. [...] David Blankenhorn cites the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says that a child has [...] "the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents," [...] in support of this argument (before he reversed position on the issue). [...] Some same-sex marriage opponents argue that having and raising children is the underlying purpose of marriage. The opponents {{of same-sex}} marriage assume that same-sex unions implicitly lack the everyday ability of opposite-sex couples to produce and raise offspring by natural means. They also argue that children raised by same-sex partners are disadvantaged in various ways and that same-sex unions thus cannot be recognized within the scope of [...] "marriage." [...] The argument that a child has the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents leaves a number of issues open to debate involving same-sex marriage, including infertile heterosexual couples or couples not wishing for children, as well as same-sex unions where a family exists with children from previous relationships, [...] adoption, artificial insemination, surrogacy, or co-parenting. Social consequences are also heavily debated, such as whether marriage should be defined in terms of procreation.|$|E
