5|$|Outside of sociology, he {{influenced}} philosophers Henri Bergson and Emmanuel Levinas, and {{his ideas}} {{can be found}} latently {{in the work of}} certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as Alain Badiou, Louis Althusser, and <b>Michel</b> <b>Foucault.</b> Recently, Durkheim has influenced philosophers such as Charles Taylor and Hans Joas.|$|E

5|$|Establishment of {{sociology}} as an independent, recognized academic discipline is amongst Durkheim's {{largest and most}} lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, Célestin Bouglé, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, <b>Michel</b> <b>Foucault,</b> Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, Robert Bellah, social reformer Patrick Hunout and others.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic <b>Michel</b> <b>Foucault</b> observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
