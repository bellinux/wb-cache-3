40|$|The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is a mega-nourishment {{characterized}} by a very large sand volume of around 20 million m 3 placed along the Dutch coast. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is a pilot project to evaluate the performance of an alternative nourishment strategy with respect to different functions of the coastal system. Within {{the scope of the}} coastal functions, the hook-shaped design of the initial morphology of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> involves a sheltered (man-made) lagoon. The morphology of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> and particularly the area around the lagoon entrance has changed over time since the construction in 2011. As a result of the changing inlet and lagoon morphology, the tidal conditions inside the basin have changed. We have set up a detailed numerical model to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions inside the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor’s</b> tidal lagoon {{as a function of the}} water level at sea and the measured local morphology of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> It is found that the tidal response inside the lagoon changes significantly as a function of the changing morphology. The analysis reveals a prediction of the temporal development of the tidal range and mean water level inside the lagoon, which can be used to predict the closure of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> lagoon.

40|$|The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is a megasuppletion {{pilot project}} {{constructed}} in sea {{next to the}} beach between The Hague and Hoek van Holland. The application of 21 * 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 of sea sediment will prevent ecosystem disturbance by suppletion for the next 20 years and the sand will be distributed over the coast by natural processes. This research focusses on hydrogeochemical processes on the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> since oxidation of former sea sediments can influence the soil and water quality. The mineral pyrite (FeSÂ­Â­ 2) is formed on the seafloor {{and is expected to}} dissolve in ground- and pore water upon oxidation. The sulphide mineral is of interest, because oxidation could acidify the groundwater and possibly mobilise adsorbed trace contaminants. In order to evaluate whether geochemical processes may form a negative aspect of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> fieldwork was on performed on the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a traditional suppletion site and a control site. The groundwater and pore water samples were measured for alkalinity, ions, major elements and trace elements. Soluble sulphate in combination with iron oxide confirms the oxidation of pyrite on the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> but large-scale presence of pyrite is not proven. The oxidation effects are most prominent in the unsaturated zone {{in the middle of the}} <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> where freshening has advanced the furthest. The buffering capacity is generally high, however, a selection of samples shows acidification or decreased alkalinity due to pyrite oxidation in the unsaturated zone. This results in trace elements exceeding target values and occasionally intervention values for shallow groundwater. The impact of pyrite oxidation on the traditional suppletion site is moderate. However, the control site indicates, contrary to expectations, more significant pyrite oxidation. Long-term monitoring of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is recommended to see whether the elevated trace element concentrations are temporal or will persist for longer periods of time...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} in coastal maintenance is {{the application of}} a large scale nourishment as natural feeder of the coast. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> constructed near Kijkduin on the Holland Coast is a pilot project of this new nourishment strategy. The objective of this research is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the sediment transport processes at nourishments by analysing the sediment sorting processes. Field data of the sediment characteristics in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> area is used to determine the sediment sorting in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> area. A numerical model (Delft 3 D) is used to simulate the sediment sorting processes and time scales in the cross-shore direction at a large scale nourishment. The measurement data showed an increase of the sediment sorting in the longshore direction. The sediment at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> was coarser than the sediment in the area North of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> It is hypothesised that the fining North of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is caused by the deposition of relatively fine material that is eroded at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> A measured decrease of the uniformity coefficient at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is in accordance with this hypothesis. In the cross-shore direction the minimum median grain size in the transects was found to move seaward after the construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> It is assumed that the wave conditions preceding these measurements influenced the location of the minimum median grain size. Higher wave conditions are assumed to lead to a minimum median grain size located further offshore due to the stronger undertow. The model results show a strong influence of the sedimentation and erosion in the profile on the sediment sorting pattern. This pattern is found to be independent of the initial bathymetry and initial sediment composition of the nourishment. It is shown that extreme wave heights have a large influence on the sediment distribution in the profile as wave conditions determine the area where sediment sorting takes place. Furthermore, the sediment distribution also responds more quickly to higher waves. Finally, the hypothesis is confirmed that the location of the minimum median grain size in the profile depends on the wave conditions. Model results show that the location of the minimum median grain size is located at the edge of the morphologically active profile and is thus related to the wave height via the closure depth formulation. To conclude, this research consists of new measurement information on the sediment composition in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> area and a comparison of this data set with existing measurement campaigns. This information shows the influence of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> on the alongshore and cross-shore sediment sorting and states the influence of the wave conditions on the location of the minimum median grain size in the profile. The model study shows the utility of a relatively simple Delft 3 D model to study the influence of different parameters on the sediment sorting processes and the timescale of these processes.

40|$|Expanding {{knowledge}} {{concerning the}} close entanglement between subtidal and subaerial processes in coastal environments initiated {{the development of}} the open-source Windsurf modeling framework that enables us to simulate multi-fraction sediment transport due to subtidal and subaerial processes simultaneously. The Windsurf framework couples separate model cores for subtidal morphodynamics related to waves and currents and storms and aeolian sediment transport. The Windsurf framework bridges three gaps in our ability to model long-term coastal morphodynamics: differences in time scales, land/water boundary and differences in meshes. The Windsurf framework is applied to the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> mega-nourishment. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is virtually permanentlyexposed to tides, waves and wind and is consequently highly dynamic. In order to understand the complex morphological behavior of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> it is vital to take both subtidal and subaerial processes into account. The ultimate aim {{of this study is to}} identify governing processes in aeolian sediment transport estimates in coastal environments and improve the accuracy of long-term coastal morphodynamic modeling. At the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> beach armoring occurs on the dry beach. In contrast to the dry beach, no armor layer can be established in the intertidal zone due to periodic flooding. Consequently, during low tide non-armored intertidal beaches are susceptible for wind erosion and, although moist, may provide a larger aeolian sediment supply than the vast dry beach areas. Hence, subtidal processes significantly influence the subaerial morphology and both need to be accounted for to understand the long-term aeolian morphodynamic behavior of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> Coastal Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In 2011 the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> was {{realised}} at {{the coast}} of the province of South-Holland as a pilot project combining different functions such as safety, recreation and nature development, following the philosophy of Building with Nature. The idea was to create a mega nourishment that would supply the coastal system between Hook of Holland and Scheveningen with new sediment for the upcoming 20 years. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is being monitored to get more information and knowledge on the behaviour on this type of nourishment since it has been the first one on such a large scale. In the winter of 2013 a couple of heavy storms have passed along the Dutch coast of which the storm of December 5 th, from here on referred to as "Decemberstorm" (Dutch: "Sinterklaasstorm"), was the most severe with significant wave heights up to 5. 4 m. For this storm bathymetrical measurements are available of the pre- and post-storm situation. This gives a unique opportunity to get insight into the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that are important at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> during storms. In this study therefore the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic changes during a storm are investigated using the Decemberstorm as a reference case. This study presents an analysis of the Decemberstorm from which the results are partly used as input for the modelling phase and partly to validate the model results. The model study consists of depth averaged and 3 D models of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> as well as an XBeach model which compares the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> to a uniform coastline.

40|$|Bed {{sediment}} composition, with a {{focus on}} the median grain size D 50, was investigated at a large-scale nourishment (The ‘Sand Motor’) at the Dutch coast (∼ 21. 5 million m 3 sand). Considerable alongshore heterogeneity of the bed composition (D 50) was observed as the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> evolved over time with (1) coarsening of the exposed part of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> (+ 90 to + 150 μm) and (2) a depositional area with relatively fine material (50 μm finer) just North and South of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The alongshore heterogeneity of the measured D 50 values was most evident outside the surfzone (i. e. seaward of MSL − 4 m). Coarsening of the bed after construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> was attributed to hydrodynamic sorting processes, because the alongshore heterogeneity of the D 50 showed a similar spatial pattern as the mean bed shear stresses. The observed alongshore heterogeneity of the D 50 and correlation of D 50 with modelled mean bed shear stresses suggest that preferential erosion of the finer sand fractions has taken place. The selective transport of finer sand fractions results in a coarser top layer of the bed at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The preferential transport is most dominant during mild and moderate conditions when hydrodynamic forcing conditions are close to the critical bed shear stresses for transport. The measurements also show the impact of a storm, which consists of a ∼ 40 μm finer D 50 of the offshore bed composition in front of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> (i. e. where a considerably coarser bed was in place). Additionally, storms may generate a (temporary) zone with fine bed material at the toe of the deposition profile. This means that the coarsening of the bed is reduced by storms {{as a result of the}} mobilization of both coarse and fine sediment and mixing of the bed with the relatively finer substrate...|$|R
40|$|Beach state classification, though simple in its concept, is {{difficult}} to be distinctly and accurately applied in some real life situations. The issue is further compounded when it is applied to mega- nourishments which, in essence, are morphologically different {{in terms of an}} artificially-formed beach versus a naturally-forming beach. Yet, another contributing factor could be due to the difference in geographical locations, with varying wave heights, wave periods and sediment sizes, which result in different permutations of the dimensionless fall-velocity (?) values. The six beach state classification scheme presented by Wright and Short (1984) has been the widely-accepted guidelines in the coastal engineering community. Even when references are made to these diagrams, there is an issue of subjectivity as not all coastal researchers may reach the same conclusion when the same image of a particular nearshore morphology is used. This has been found through a questionnaire finding. This paper thus attempts to present a conceptual quantification technique which analyses the alongshore variability along the coast of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> as a basis to classify beach state indiscriminately and objectively. Three beach states, namely Longshore Bar Trough (LBT), Rhythmic Bar and Beach (RBB) and Transverse Bar and Rip (TBR), have been observed at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> from bathymetric surveys which spanned a monitoring period of two years. It has been found that the success rate of executing the objective beach state classification via the conceptual quantification technique is 94. 0 % for LBT, 66. 6 % for RBB and 54. 4 % for TBR features. Interestingly, LBT {{has been found to be}} the persistent and occasional beach state at the updrift and downdrift of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> respectively. Furthermore, it has been observed that these occurrences of beach state along the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> can be divided into three temporal stages namely the formative, the dormant and the developed phases. Stage I has been associated with the formative period of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> since its completion in August 2011. It has largely been affected by the formation of a spit and its subsequent dynamics while advancing towards the downdrift of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> Stage II has been a relatively dormant phase where there were no significant changes to the observed beach states. Stage III is considered the developed phase where beach states could be observed along the whole analysed length of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> These three stages have been found to be sensitive to seasonal variations, particularly the increased number of storm events during winter period. The development of the beach states is also found to be highly dependent on the spit dynamics in the case of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree ProgrammeHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-automated approach to detecting coastal shoreline change with high spatial- and temporal-resolution using X-band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data. The method was applied at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a “mega-scale” beach nourishment project in the Netherlands. Natural processes, like waves, wind, and tides, gradually distribute the highly concentrated sand to adjacent beaches. Currently, various in-situ techniques are used to monitor the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, the TerraSAR-X satellite collects two high-resolution (3 × 3 m), cloud-penetrating SAR images every 11 days. This study investigates whether shorelines detected in TerraSAR-X imagery are accurate enough to monitor the shoreline dynamics of a project like the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The study proposes and implements a semi-automated workflow to extract shorelines from all 182 available TerraSAR-X images acquired between 2011 and 2014. The shorelines are validated using bi-monthly RTK-GPS topographic surveys and nearby wave and tide measurements. A valid shoreline could be extracted from 54 % of the images. The horizontal accuracy of these shorelines is approximately 50 m, which is sufficient to assess the larger scale shoreline dynamics of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The accuracy is affected strongly by sea state and partly by acquisition geometry. We conclude that using frequent, high-resolution TerraSAR-X imagery is a valid option for assessing coastal dynamics {{on the order of}} tens of meters at approximately monthly interval...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature of aeolian {{sediment}} availability and its influence on aeolian sediment transport. The aim is to improve large scale and long term aeolian sediment transport estimates in (nourished) coastal environments. The generally poor performance of aeolian sediment transport models with respect to measurements in coastal environments is often accredited to limitations in sediment availability. Sediment availability can be limited by particular properties of the bed surface. For example, if the beach is moist or covered with non-erodible elements, like shells. If sediment availability is limited, the aeolian sediment transport rate is governed by the sediment availability rather than the wind transport capacity. Aeolian sediment availability is rather intangible as sediment availability is not only affected by aeolian processes, but also by marine and meteorological processes that act {{on a variety of}} spatial and temporal scales. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> 21 Mm 3 mega nourishment is used to quantify the spatiotemporal variations in aeolian sediment availability and its effect on aeolian sediment transport. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> was constructed in 2011 along the Dutch coast. Aeolian sediment accumulation in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> region is low compared to the wind transport capacity, while the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> itself is virtually permanently exposed to wind and accommodates large fetches. Aeolian sediment availability is therefore likely to dominate aeolian sediment accumulation. Multi-annual bi-monthly measurements of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor's</b> topography are used for a large scale aeolian sediment budget analysis. The analysis revealed that aeolian sediment supply from the dry beach area, that is almost permanently exposed to wind, diminished a half year after construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The reduction in aeolian sediment supply is likely due {{to the development of a}} beach armor layer. In the subsequent years, two-third of the aeolian sediment deposits originate from the low-lying beaches that are frequently flooded and therefore often moist. The importance of the low-lying beaches in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> region is tested during a six-week field campaign. Gradients in aeolian sediment transport are measured during the field campaign as to localize aeolian sediment source and sink areas. A consistent supply from the intertidal beach area was measured that was temporarily deposited at the higher dry beach. The temporary deposits were transported further during high water, when sediment supply from the intertidal beach ceased, resulting in a continuous sediment supply to the dunes. The temporary deposition of sediment at the dry beach was likely promoted by the presence of a berm that affects the local wind shear. Moreover, the berm edge coincided with the onset of the beach armor layer that might have further promoted deposition of sediment. The measurements on spatiotemporal variations in aeolian sediment availability and supply inspired an attempt to capture the characteristics of aeolian sediment availability in coastal environments in a comprehensive model approach. The resulting model simulates spatiotemporal variations in bed surface properties and their combined influence on aeolian sediment availability and transport. The implementation of multi-fraction aeolian sediment transport in the model introduces the recurrence relation between aeolian sediment availability and transport through self-grading of sediment. The model was applied in a four-year hindcast of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> mega nourishment as first field validation. The model reproduces the multi-annual aeolian sediment erosion and deposition volumes, and the relative importance of the intertidal beach area as source of aeolian sediment well. Seasonal variations in aeolian sediment transport are incidentally missed by the model. The model accuracy is reflected in a R 2 value of 0. 93 when comparing time series of measured and modeled total aeolian sediment transport volumes in the four years since construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> The results suggest that indeed significant limitations in sediment availability, due to soil moisture content and beach armoring, govern aeolian sediment transport in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> region. A comparison with a simulation without limitation in sediment availability suggests that aeolian sediment availability in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> region is limited to about 25 % of the wind transport capacity. Moreover, both spatial and temporal variations in aeolian sediment availability as well as the recurrence relation between aeolian sediment availability and transport are essential to accurate long term and large scale aeolian sediment transport estimates.

40|$|The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is {{a unique}} and dynamic {{solution}} for coastal erosion, aimed at distributing the nourished sand along the Delfland coast. Besides enhancing coastal protection, the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> {{has been designed to}} also provide opportunities for recreation and nature development. The contributions of ecosystems to human well-being, that arise from interaction between biotic and abiotic processes, are called ecosystem services. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> provides several ecosystem services, such as recreation, coastal protection, a fresh water supply by dune filtration and it provides different types of habitats for species. Typically, ecosystem services are evaluated for one snapshot in time, usually at the initial state of the design. However, due to the dynamics of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> the ecosystem services are likely to change over time and space. To research the ecosystem service dynamics of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> in the future, {{there is a need for}} an objective and concrete framework that is able to assess the services on a temporal and spatial scale. Predicting the response of a nourishment on the ecosystem services by means of a process-based model could improve the decision-making regarding integrated coastal zone management. The aim of this study is to assess the decadal development of the ecosystem services of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> This research focused on some of the services the mega-nourishment provides, namely coastal protection, recreation and habitat provision. Future morphological behavior of this intervention is being studied by process-based numerical models, which has resulted in morphological predictions, made with Delft 3 D, up to forty years ahead. There are many factors that are important to the actual use of ecosystem services that are difficult to incorporate into a long-term prediction. Therefore this research focused on the long-term potential of the ecosystem to contribute to human well-being, based on the physical capacity of the ecosystem to provide the service. The ecosystem service potential of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is evaluated on a yearly basis, forty years ahead and on a large spatial scale from Hoek van Holland to Scheveningen. The state-of-the-art Delft 3 D model was set up to make a long-term forecast of the morphology and, according to literature, has not been used previously in (dynamic) ecosystem service assessments. To verify the model performance regarding the prediction of ecosystem service dynamics, the computed ecosystem service potential was validated using the first four years of observations. The results indicate a robust enhancement regarding coastline maintenance that holds beyond the envisaged lifetime of twenty years. North of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> the coastline orientation is predicted to change, thereby decreasing the sediment transport gradients. Beach width available for recreation is expected to increase drastically along the entire Delfland coast. This may threaten the recreational potential at the beach of Scheveningen South, Kijkduin and Hoek van Holland. Regarding nature development, the diversity of habitats has increased on a spatial scale and will be preserved over time. To compare the effects of changing design parameters on the potential, the ecosystem service dynamics are evaluated for two alternative mega-nourishment designs: an offshore Island and an upscaled traditional foreshore nourishment that is implemented every four years. The research turned out to be a useful exploration of the opportunities of using a morphological model forecast for ecosystem service prediction. Furthermore, a dynamic assessment in which the long-term situation is evaluated annually, on a large spatial scale, has proven to be valuable to Building with Nature solutions. Ecosystem services are not yet explicitly incorporated in the design of Building with Nature projects and this research takes a step towards integrating ecosystem services into the design of future nourishments.

40|$|The coastal {{bathymetry}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} essential inputs for understanding, monitoring and modelling the coastal environment. A remote sensing technique called marine radar may overcome disadvantages of present monitoring techniques and has the advantage to obtain measurements with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A Fast Fourier Transformation on the radar images produces pairs of wavenumbers and wave frequencies that can be linked to water depths and velocities by means of the dispersion relation. The drawback of present radar processing software is it closed and fixed nature and unclear accuracy. Therefore an X-band Matlab Fitting algorithm (XMFit) was developed by Friedman (2014). This development was induced by a radar stationed near the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a large nourishment, near Kijkduin in the Netherlands. However, XMFit requires further validation and a solution for the present bias in the depth estimate. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to determine the accuracy of XMFit radar-derived bathymetry at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> for a storm in October 2014 and determine the cause for the present overestimation of the water depth by XMFit. The accuracy is obtained by validation studies for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> and Ameland radar and the error sources follow from analyses of the 3 D wavenumber frequency space (kw-space). The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> validation study shows a mean depth bias of XMFit of 4. 21 m. The XMFit accuracy depends on waveheight, wave period, precipitation and water depth. Additionally, fields of XMFit flow velocities sometimes show a growing eddy on the lee side of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> A mean depth bias of 1. 04 m is found for a comparable validation study at Ameland. In contradiction with the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> the Ameland depth bias depends differently on the metocean conditions, the water depth and the radar range. Nine different error sources were identified in this thesis. The in situ data, the fitting procedure of the XMFit and the bottom slope were found to have a negligible contribution to the depth bias. The metocean conditions, the precipitation, the Rhine's fresh water plume, amplitude dispersion and the water depth itself do have a considerable effect on the depth bias. Precipitation explains many of the large outliers of the XMFit depth estimate. Some other extreme outliers coincide with the passing of the fresh water plume. The increased depth bias for large ranges at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is due to the increased bias at deeper water depths and not due to the incidence angle. A comparison of the in situ depth with the depth that can actually be felt by the existing wave climate showed that the applicability of the dispersion relation is stretched too far at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> A filter has been developed separating valid from invalid results based on the L<L 0 -criterion. The invalid depth estimates show a 2 m higher depth bias than the valid depth estimates. XMFit's reduced accuracy at the shallower water depths can be attributed to the fact that XMFit does not include amplitude dispersion. A simple computation of amplitude dispersion for shallow water depths showed a reduction of the depth bias by 0. 2 m. Some of these error sources can be filtered from the XMFit results. Filtering on preferential metocean conditions and radar range reduces the depth bias of 4. 2 m at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> by 1. 9 m to 2. 3 m. A depth bias of 0. 8 m remains in the Ameland results after applying a comparable filter. This remaining depth bias is induced by a shift of the measured energy in the kw-space. The energy is observed at smaller wavenumbers than theoretically expected. The XMFit fit aligns exactly with the provided energy. The accuracy of XMFit cannot be improved by giving more importance to the longer waves, since the energy is also shifted for these longer waves. During storm conditions energy is also observed on a the location of the first harmonic of the dispersion relation. Although this first harmonic is not observed to influence the depth bias, it does cause a severe onshore directed velocity error. Additionally, this kw-space shows stripes of energy which can be attributed to the bottom slope. None of the researched error sources explains the shift of the energy in the kw-space. Therefore it becomes likely that the error is related to a cause outside of the XMFit Algorithm. To find this cause, the local radar set-up and the preprocessing before the XMFit algorithm should be investigated.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{existence}} and character of tidal flow separation at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a mega-scale <b>sand</b> nourishment at the Delfland coast. Tidal flow contracts {{at the tip of}} the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> downstream the tip the flow diverges and flow separation could occur. In case of flow separation the diverging streamlines cannot follow the contours of the coastline and the main flow will detach from the coastline. Flow separation causes an eddy downstream of the tip. The spatial variation in tidal flow is important to investigate, because the presence of tidal flow separation could be a hazard for swimmer safety. An advantage of the presence of tidal flow separation is the possible increased mixing of nutrients. By a literature study the first expectations about the location and period of tidal flow separation are done. Comparable studies to tidal flow separation are done in the past, which are relevant for this research. Two important conditions for tidal flow separation are an adverse pressure gradient and a developed boundary layer. From the literature study can be concluded that the location of the eddy generated by tidal flow separation is on the leeside of the headland. During the second half of the flood or ebb period tidal flow separation was expected, because then the two conditions are present. The core of this research is the field measurement campaign using GPS-tracked drifters. In total 15 measurement sessions are performed during both flood and ebb periods. The drifters recorded flow convergence and offshore flow near the tip of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> which possibly indicated the presence of tidal flow separation. The observed flow patterns are subsequently processed and characterized. To characterize the measurement sessions, the environmental conditions are researched. By observing radar images of the drifter sessions, the importance of the freshwater plume, discharged from the Rhine River, became visible. It interrupted tidal flow separation multiple times during drifter sessions. Also tidal flow separation and the associated eddy were observed in the radar images. Interpretation of the measurements shows that the wind conditions and the freshwater plume are the most important environmental conditions for the appearance or absence of tidal flow separation. By observing the results of several flood measurement sessions, the eddy seems to grow in time and gradually extends further offshore. The importance of the timing of the drifter sessions, to measure the tidal flow separation is tested with the numerical model D-Flow FM. The model is used to research the development in time of the flow separation and the associated eddy. Simulations show that the eddy travels from north to south during flood, which explains the measurements several flow patterns during flow separation. The simulations also show growth of the eddy between its generation and dissipation. The model is also used to research the adverse pressure gradient, by testing when the Bernoulli Effect is active {{at the tip of the}} <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> Around the peak of the high water the effect is present, causing an earlier presence of an adverse pressure gradient, which is an essential condition for tidal flow separation. This means that flow separation already could start around the peak of the high water during flood. Tidal flow separation could be a hazard for swimmers near the tip of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> If caught by the current during tidal flow separation, there is no easy escape opportunity and swimmers can be transported a couple of hundred metres offshore. Not only the tidal flow separation is a hazard for swimmer safety, but also the currents in the surf zone could be dangerous. These are even less predictable than tidal flow separation, so the general advice for swimmers would be not to swim near the tip of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> Coastal EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Large beach nourishments {{are often}} {{considered}} an {{efficient way to}} deal with coastal zone management issues, notably coastal erosion. Such large nourishments can act as a geometric perturbation, which might cause the tidal current to detach from the coastline. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is a mega-scale beach nourishment in the Netherlands. Field observations of the tidal flow field north of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> are presented, showing evidence of flow separation and eddy formation during the flood phase of the tide. GPS-tracked drifters are transported offshore upon deployment near the tip of the nourishment. Flow convergence measured with nearshore current profilers is indicative of flow reversal at the lee side. Images of the temporal development of coherent patterns in time-averaged X-band radar backscatter align with in-situ observations of the flow field. Tidal flow separation at such large nourishments might have an impact on morphological development of the nourishment, as well as on swimmer safety.

40|$|The {{sediment}} {{composition of}} the sea bed is of relevance for various coastal properties such as bed forms, beach slopes and marine ecology. Furthermore it may significantly influence the morphological evolution of the coast. The sediment sorting processes at natural beaches are, however, difficult to distinguish since {{there can be a}} both a large temporal variability in bed composition as well as considerable spatial heterogeneity resulting from geological history. Often encountered problems are the lack of knowledge concerning the initial bed composition and the low spatial and temporal sampling for most field surveys. While latter is generally insufficient to analyse the sorting processes at natural beaches with some certainty, a lot of data is available for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a large scale nourishment near the coast of Kijkduin. Before, during and after the construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> sediment sampling measurements have taken place, whether or not in combination with other research (e. g. fauna development). To continue the insights in the sediment sorting near the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> a new measurement campaign was set-up in February 2014. The 173 measurement points were chosen based on general coastal theory, previous measurements and model simulations. The whole campaign was merely intended to indicate the spatial variability of sediment composition: strategic transects were sampled very densely (sampling interval of +/- 20 meter) to indicate the precise location of grain size gradients. An additional feature is the inclusion of alongshore transects, to be able to analyse alongshore variability. The results of the campaign showed the presence of a large fine patch in the north of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> a smaller fine patch just south, coarse sediments in the swash zone and very course sediments in the most energetic part of the nourishment. In addition, gradients in alongshore direction proved to be of similar order as in cross-shore. The direct inter-comparison between previous campaigns showed to be rather difficult due to the variety in number of samples and the different methods of sample analysis; therefore the campaign in this research particularly supports observations made with the help of previous measurements. However, a general tendency towards the initial situation could be observed: where the measurements just after the construction of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> showed (on average) much coarser material than measured before construction, all campaigns thereafter were consecutively finer when considering the overall sediment composition. Although the maximum inaccuracy of the sampling method is not very large (order 3 %) the uncertainties in representativity of the samples are thought of to be quite influential. Especially in campaigns with only a few samples precaution should be taken when stating conclusions. In future research it is recommended to take undisturbed depth samples, with for example a corer.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} nourishment {{known as}} the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> has been implemented along the Dutch coast as a Building with Nature solution designed for the upcoming 20 years. Given the long-term period of the project, a combination of in situ measurements and remote sensing techniques are currently in use. An X-band radar system is deployed at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor,</b> but requires further research into its applicability in such a dynamic coastal climate. Radar data can be processed into hydrodynamic parameters such as waves, currents and bathymetry information through use of a 3 D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This technology is highly desirable for coastal engineering applications since it presents a relatively effortless method to capture high resolution spatial and temporal hydrodynamic parameters. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop an X-band radar depth inversion model at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> for further investigation into remote sensing as an accurate tool for estimating nearshore hydrodynamics. The developed model should be able to accurately estimate hydrodynamic parameters from raw X-band radar images with high temporal and spatial resolution. This thesis explains the development, calibration and validation of the X-band MATLAB Fitting (XMFit) model at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> for a single storm in October 2013. XMFit proved to be a valuable remote sensing tool for extracting nearshore hydrodynamics based on in situ comparisons. The SeaDarQ software developed by Nortek B. V. is also used as a quality benchmark. The storm results showed that the XMFit is more robust and accurate relative to the currently available SeaDarQ software. A sensitivity analysis was completed to further analyze the spatial and temporal patterns associated with XMFit accuracy. Spatial statistics indicated high error {{around the edges of the}} radar domain, which led to a reduced radar footprint by implementing a spatial cutoff of 2. 5 km. The smaller domain results in much less scatter with a near-constant linear bias of 2 m. High accuracy in XMFit is directly linked with waves exceeding 1 m, wind speeds exceeding 12 m/s and the alignment of wind and waves. The metocean limits help conclude that XMFit requires spectra spreading in wavelength-frequency space to help constrain the dispersion shell. This finding directly links with locally generated wind waves, more commonly referred to as wind sea. Ideal results based on the spatial and temporal limits further reduced the linear bias to approximately 1. 6 m. The ideal conditions show a much better agreement between radar-derived and in situ bathymetry and hydrodynamics. A relationship between the inaccuracy of XMFit during flood tide was linked to complex nearshore hydrodynamics around the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> Note that the flood tide at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> exhibits complex flow structures (i. e. stratification and large scale eddy formation on the lee side). XMFit averages these complex 3 D flow structures evident during flood tide into a single large computational cube, which drastically simplifies the hydrodynamics. This work concludes by emphasizing the need for additional research into XMFit since it proved applicable at the Ameland inlet along the Dutch coast. Instantaneous results increase confidence in XMFit given its ability to extract the complex ebb-tidal delta, the orientation of the flood channel and coherent wave-induced currents. This work proves that XMFit is a valuable model for extracting high resolution spatial and temporal hydrodynamic parameters. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Wind-driven (aeolian) sand {{transport}} {{from the}} beach is of prime importance to coastal dune formation and growth, as well as dune recovery after a severe storm. The amount of aeolian sand transport is not only determined by wind speed, but also by beach surface characteristics, predominantly moisture content. The surface moisture content is determined by processes in the atmosphere (evaporation and precipitation) and in the groundwater (via capillary transport). The groundwater level below the beach is governed mostly by the tide. However, the exact importance of the tide in determining surface moisture content is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aims to find this relation, {{in order to better}} understand and predict aeolian sediment transport patterns in the future. A six-week field campaign was performed at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> in fall 2014. Sea surface elevation was measured with a pressure transducer below the low-water line, while 8 dipwells were deployed to measure groundwater levels in a 80 -m long cross-shore array. A Delta T Theta probe was used to measure surface moisture content along the same array. It was found that the tide and the bed profile control the spatial and temporal patterns in surface moisture content. The tidal oscillations in the sea surface propagate into the beach, which makes the water table below the beach oscillate with tidal frequency. The inland water table of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> is located 1 m above NAP. The slope of the water table is relatively constant, and it is independent of the slope of the beach surface. Therefore, a low beach slope results in an intersection of the water table and the bed surface. This gives a high surface moisture content. The water table affects the surface moisture content at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> when it is within 0. 3 m below the bed surface. In this case the potential for aeolian sand transport can be reduced. A spring-neap tidal cycle was found in the amount of time throughout the day that this influence was present. During neap tide, the groundwater level was further below the surface, so the capillary fringe could reach the surface for a smaller amount of time. Therefore, the potential for aeolian sand transport will be highest during neap tide...|$|R

40|$|Impact {{of spatial}} {{variability}} in the nearshore bathymetry on net sediment transport rates has been investigated for a selection of observed beach states at the Dutch coast. The beach states comprise a longshore bar trough and two transverse bar rip situations, which were present at the large scale <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor</b> nourishment at the Holland coast. These observed bathymetric features were then applied multiple times {{next to each other}} along a longer stretch of coast to obtain a repeating pattern of the considered beach state. The wave transformation towards the shore, alongshore wave-driven and water-level setup driven currents and sediment transport were computed with the Delft 3 D model, which has been applied successfully for many other studies at the <b>Sand</b> <b>Motor.</b> It was found that net sediment transport is considerably influenced for the most pronounced transverse bar rip configuration, which was most prominent for conditions with small wave angles (i. e. less than 10 ° from shore-normal). Furthermore, a decrease in transport rates is found for conditions from larger angles of wave incidence (i. e. 30 to 45 ° from shore-normal). Impacts of the bathymetries of longshore bar trough and the less pronounced transverse bar rip system on net sediment transport rates were much smaller. The actual cause for the enhancement (or decrease) of the net transport for the transverse bar rip configuration is expected to be related to 1) the oblique orientation of the rip-channel for the considered configuration as well as to 2) a more diffusive pattern of the wave breaking {{as a result of the}} refraction on the spatially variable bathymetry.
