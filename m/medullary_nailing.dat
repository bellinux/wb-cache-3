40|$|The {{satisfactory}} results obtained from <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> are well known, and {{the method is}} widely used in fracture work. It is thus important {{to call attention to}} yet another danger inherent in the technique-namely air embolism. Simple means of overcoming this danger are also referred to. CASE REPORT A man of thirty-one sustained a minor head injury with transient loss of consciousness, a closed fracture of the right tibia and fibula, and a closed fracture of the mid-shaft of the right femur. His general condition presented no problem and he recovered rapidly from the head injury. The fractured tibia and fibula were immobilised in plaster. There was gross displacement of the fractured mid-shaft of femur, uncorrectible by manipulation, and it was obvious that there was muscle interposition. Operative reduction and <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> were undertaken through an antero-lateral incision. The patient was thin, and all vessels were picked up before they were divided, the fracture thus being exposed with practically no bleeding. At that time the practice in this hospital was to determine the calibre of the nail to be used by trial and error. The narrowest part of the medullary cavity being in this cas...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Close {{reduction}} and intra <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> {{has been established}} as the treatment for femoral shaft fractures with a nonunion rate of 0. 9 - 1. 1 %; though, it is still controversial. Currently, the most accepted method for treatment of non union is exchange nailing. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate treatment of femoral shaft fractures non union via 2 methods of exchange nailing with bone graft and nail removal, and plating with bone graft. Methods: In this case series study, we included all patients with aseptic nonunion femoral fracture who referred to Rasool-Akram hospital from 2007 to 2012 and were clinically indicated for reoperation for nonunion after primary intra <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing.</b> Patients were assessed clinically and radiologically. The patients were treated via either method according {{to the type of}} nonunion (atrophic, oligotrophic, hypertrophic). Collected data were recorded in check lists and analyzed with SPSS V. 18 software. Results: Of 23 patients with mean age of 30. 4 ± 8. 5 years, 13 (56 %) were treated by exchange nailing with bone graft and 10 (44 %) treated by plating and bone graft. Complete union was achieved in 85. 7 % of patients treated by exchange nailing and bone graft and in 90. 9 % of patients treated with plating with bone graft. No leg length discrepancy, pain and infection were reported. Conclusion: This study suggests that treatment results of nonunion femoral fractures with plating bone graft method is as good as or even better than exchange nailing with bone graft. In addition, the prevalence of femoral fracture nonunion seems to be more than what was expected before...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{describes}} FRACAS, a computer-integrated orthopedic system for assisting surgeons in performing closed <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> of long bone fractures. FRACAS’s {{goal is to}} reduce the surgeon’s cumulative exposure to radiation and surgical complications associated with alignment and positioning errors of bone fragments, nail insertion, and distal screw locking. It replaces uncorrelated, static fluoroscopic images with a virtual reality display of three-dimensional bone models created from preoperative computed tomography and tracked intraoperatively in real time. Fluoroscopic images are used to register the bone models to the intraoperative situation and to verify that the registration is maintained. This {{article describes}} the system concept, software prototypes of preoperative modules (modeling, nail selection, and visualization), intraoperative modules (fluoroscopic image processing and tracking), and preliminary in vitro experimental results to date. Our experiments suggest that the modeling, nail selection, and visualization modules yield adequate results and that fluoroscopic image processing with submillimetric accuracy is practically feasible on clinical images.

40|$|In 1949 Leslie Rush {{described}} a new method of management of Colles' fractures {{by means of}} a rigid <b>medullary</b> <b>nail.</b> Claude Py in 1969 followed this concept but used two flexible intramedullary pins. After briefly recalling the biomechanical principle and operating technique, the authors outline their series of 39 extra- and intra-articular fractures (10 males and 29 females) operated between March 1995 and April 1996 with an average follow-up of 6. 5 months (1. 5 - 14. 5 months). The radiological and functional results are discussed: 55 % of the cases showed good anatomical reduction whereas 59 % achieved a satisfactory functional result. The advantage of this operating technique lies in its simplicity. Nevertheless, considerable experience is necessary owing to the relatively high complication rate (secondary displacement, tendon or nerve lesions, reflex sympathetic dystrophy). However, this method requires only a limited amount of time and remains a good indication for extra-articular and simple articular fractures. In the case of severe posterior comminution, the use of cancellous bone graft can help to prevent secondary dorsal impaction and its repercussion on distal radio-ulnar function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdamantinoma {{is a rare}} lesion of low-grade malignancy, and {{represents}} 1 % of malignant bone tumours of bones, and is mainly located in two regions of the body, jaw (ameloblastoma), and lower extremities. The treatment of choice is surgery due to it being a radio- and chemotherapy-resistant neoplasia. Clinical caseA 39 -year-old male {{with a history of}} neonatal hydrocephalus with moderate psychomotor retardation. He began with pain in the posterior region of the left thigh for one year before admission, which was managed as posterior radicular syndrome. He had sudden intense pain on walking that led him to fall over. In the examination, left pelvic limb with deformity in the distal third with increase in volume in the thigh, with pain to palpation, and presence of crackles in the distal third of the femur were observed. A biopsy of the thigh was performed, with subsequent local wide excision+replacement of bone with cadaver bone and a central <b>medullary</b> <b>nail.</b> The final diagnosis was adamantinoma of femur. ConclusionAdamantinomas are rare tumours. It is important to recognise this type of tumour from the beginning, since its prognosis is excellent in initial stages. It is important to have free margins as survival is very high...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Lower end of humerus shows {{olecranon}} and coronoid fossae {{separated by}} a thin bony septum, sometimes it may deficient and shows foramen which communicates both the fossae called Septal aperture, which is commonly referred as supratrochlear foramen (STF). Materials & Methods: We have studied 260 humeri (126 right side and 134 left side), measurements were taken by using vernier caliper, translucency septum was observed by keeping {{the lower end of}} humerus against the x-ray lobby. Results: A clear cut STF was observed in 19. 2 % bones, translucency septum was observed in 99 (91. 6 %) humeri on the right side and 95 (93. 1 %) humeri on the left sides respectively (Table – 1). Clinical significance: The presence of STF is always associated with the narrow medullary canal {{at the lower end of}} humerus, Supracondylar fracture of humerus is most common in paediatric age group, <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> is done to treat the fractures in those cases the knowledge about the STF is very important for treating the fractures. It has been observed in x-ray of lower end of the humerus the STF is comparatively radiolucent, it is commonly seen as a type of ‘pseudolesions’ in an x-ray of the lower end of humerus and it may mistake for an osteolytic or cystic lesions. Conclusion: The present study can add data into anthropology and anatomy text books regarding STF and it gives knowledge of understanding anatomical variation of distal end of the humerus, which is significant for anthropologists, orthopaedic surgeons and radiologists in habitual clinical practice...|$|E
30|$|The {{incidence}} of surgery remained low and steady during our study period. Roughly {{half of the}} patients were treated surgically by repositioning and casting or by osteosynthesis. Despite the increasing interest toward intramedullary nailing, {{its role in the}} management of humeral shaft fractures has remained low in Finland. The highest {{incidence of}} intramedullary nailing was 1.4 per 100, 000 person-years and, interestingly, it did not increase during the study period, although elastic <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> was recently suggested to be a good alternative to conservative treatment [7, 8]. Fernandez et al. [8] reported 31 children with traumatic humeral shaft fractures treated with elastic stable intramedullary nailing. In their sample, five complications occurred, all concerning the indication for surgery or technical error (skin irritation, damage of the radial nerve etc.) [8]. All patients and parents were satisfied with the treatment and all children were able to return to their sporting activities after treatment [8]. Zatti et al. [21] reported 40 patients, 14 treated with elastic stable intramedullary nailing and 16 treated with AO plates. Both groups had the same fracture healing time and functional recovery, allowing for early motion. The surgical technique of elastic nailing is simple, safe and rather atraumatic, and, therefore, valid for routine use [21]. Gordon and Garg as well as Slongo described indications and techniques for flexible titanium intramedullary nailing. They both reported optimal results of fracture treatment provided the indication is valid and the appropriate technique is used [22, 23]. Although our study did not compare the results of surgical and non-surgical treatment, conservative treatment was most often used and there was no significant trend toward an increase in surgical treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the scintimetric time course (STC) for Tc- 99 m(Sn) polyphosphate in rabbit tibias after various osteosynthetic procedures, and to correlate the findings with those from serial radiographs and with autoradiographic and histologie evaluation of the bone. The STC was similar for all treatment groups, with a peak value within the second week after surgery. Significantly different levels of the STC were found after subperiosteal exploration, plate insertion, osteotomy and compression plating, or osteotomy and <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing.</b> The radiological, autoradiographic, and histolÃgica!findings revealed that Tc- 99 m scintimetry monitors callus formation. The STC thus appears to be a valu able tool for the quantitative study of bone healing. J NucÃ-Med 22 : 693 - 698, 1981 Tc- 99 m(Sn) polyphosphate accumulates in newly formed mineralizing bone tissue (/, 2), and the sequence of events during fracture healing has been demonstrated autoradiographically in rat fractures (2). The aim of this study was to determine the Tc- 99 m(Sn) polyphosphate scintimetric time course (STC) in a series of osteotomies and experimental fractures of the rabbit's tibia and to evaluate the ability of scintimetry to demonstrate differences and variations of callus for mation by comparison of the STC with previously pub lished macroscÃpica!, radiological, and histolÃgica! findings (3). MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-five white rabbits with an average weight of 3. 4 kg (range 2. 4 - 4. 5 kg), divided into eight groups ac cording to the operation performed (Table 1), were anesthetized once a week during 4 wk for scintimetric examination of the tibia, with the exception of four of the animals in Group C (details in Table 1).

40|$|Abstract: Background: Femoral shaft {{fracture}} {{is the most}} common major paediatric orthopaedic. For generations traction and casting was the standard treatment for all femoral {{shaft fracture}}s in children. Over the past two decades the advantages of fixation and rapid mobilisation have been increasingly recognised. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in five private hospitals in the district of Bankura, West Bengal over a period of two years (April 2010 to March 2012) on 70 patients with closed shaft femur fractures between 6 - 14 years age of either sex. The aim was to find out the short term complications of titanium elastic nailing in diaphyseal fracture of femur in children and compare {{the findings of this study}} with pre- existing studies in this field. Results: In our study the most common complication was pain at nail entry site (60 %). 5. 71 % had local inflammatory reaction due to nails. Superficial infection occurred in 2. 85 %. At the end of 1 year, 2. 85 % had limb length discripancies. Proximal migration occurred in 2. 85 %. 2. 85 % encountered acute reactive synovitis, 5. 71 % developed angulation of fracture site and 2. 85 % developed per operative breakage of nail. Conclusion: The treatment of paediatric shaft femur fracture has been drastically changed over the last two decades to internal fixation by elastically stable intra- <b>medullary</b> <b>nail</b> (ESIN). In our study, we encountered only a few complications most of them being minor. Most of the complications were surgical technique related and were seen at the initial phase of the learning curve...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nonunion of diaphyseal {{fractures}} of the humerus {{are frequently}} seen in clinical practice (incidence {{of up to}} 15 % in certain studies) and osteosynthesis using dynamic compression plates, intra <b>medullary</b> <b>nails</b> and Ilizarov fixators have been reported previously. Locking compression plates (LCP) are useful {{in the presence of}} disuse osteoporosis, segmental bone loss and cortical defects that preclude strong fixation. We report a prospective followup study of the outcome of the use of LCP for humeral nonunion following failed internal fixation in which implants other than LCP had been used. Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients with nonunion of humeral shaft fractures following failed internal fixation were included in the study. The mean followup period was 3. 4 years (range: 2. 4 to 5. 7 years) and the minimum followup period was 2 years. Mean age of the patients was 41. 04 years (range: 24 to 57 years). All 24 patients underwent osteosynthesis using LCP and autologous bone grafting (cortico-cancellous iliac crest graft combined with or without fibular strut graft). Main outcome measurements included radiographic assessment of fracture union and pre and postoperative functional evaluation using the modified Constant and Murley scoring system. Results: 23 out of 24 fractures united following osteosynthesis. Average time to union was 16 weeks (range: 10 to 28 weeks). Complications included delayed union (n = 2), transient radial nerve palsy (n = 2) and persistent nonunion (n = 1). Functional evaluation using the Constant and Murley score showed excellent results in 11, good in 10, fair in two and poor outcome in one patient. Conclusions: Locking compression plating and cancellous bone grafting is a reliable option for achieving union in humeral diaphyseal nonunion with failed previous internal fixation and results in good functional outcome in patients with higher physiological demands...|$|R
30|$|Markedly poorer {{values on}} the Weber score were {{observed}} in the TSF group. The parameters for which data were collected at the follow-up examination do not show any clear differences between the three procedures, {{with the exception of}} the Weber UAJ/LAJ score. Surprisingly, the Weber score in the TSF group, with a mean of 9.8 points, was poorer than in the other group. In comparison, the mean scores were 6.7 in the IRF group. One possible reason for the limited mobility in the UAJ might be the cross-joint foot fixture used to prevent talipes and UAJ subluxation during the distraction phase. In contrast to the monolateral fixators, in which technically easy temporary arthrodesis is not possible in the fixator, this was done increasingly often with the Ilizarov ring fixator (n =  13 / 20 patients) and in almost all of the patients treated with lower-leg TSF (n =  27 / 30). Foot fixture is usually used to stabilize the UAJ in patients with fibular aplasia, those with hemimelia with an unstable UAJ, or when talipes is already present. As regular UAJ exercise with physiotherapy is not possible during temporary transfixation, restoration of the original UAJ mobility following the completion of fixator treatment is much slower, as is probably reflected in the below-average score particularly in this treatment group, which is chronologically the youngest. Most of the patients in the TSF group were children with the congenital conditions mentioned earlier. This problem was also taken into consideration at the time, and distraction at the UAJ following assembly was usually set to at least 1  cm in order to protect the cartilage during the transfixation months. This problem needs to be addressed in the future; whenever possible, surgical transfixing of the joints should be avoided through consistent physiotherapy and use of other aids—or if appropriate, early selective disassembly of the foot fixture after the end of distraction should be considered. The UAJ adjusting screws familiar from lengthening procedures using <b>medullary</b> <b>nails</b> might also play a role for fixator patients in the future (Belthur et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Background – Tibial shaft {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common among long bone fractures. Except for the fractures with minimal displacement, treatment of these fractures is always surgical. Currently, locked <b>medullary</b> <b>nailing</b> is the preferred surgical treatment. However, use of these implants necessitates a set of instruments and specific facilities which are not currently accessible in many centers in Iran. Considering the successful results of Ender nailing in the last 20 years reported in literature and the fact that Ender nailing can be performed with simpler instruments and limited facilities in Iran, we studied the results of treatment by this method. Methods – From March 1999 to June 2001, 71 patients with tibial shaft fractures (53 males and 3 females) were treated by Ender nailing at Sina Hospital, affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. We applied 2 to 3 Ender nails 4 to 4. 5 mm in diameter. These nails were inserted in the medulla after making 2 small incisions near the tibial tuberosity in lateral and medial sides. Using descriptive statistics, we showed the satisfactory results of this set of operations. Results – Twenty-two (39. 3 %) fractures were closed and 34 (60. 9 %) were open. Of the 56 patients, 55 (98. 2 %) achieved union 8 (mean: 4. 7) months after the operation. In 46 (82. 1 %), the fracture united in a maximum of 5 months and in 9 (16. 1 %), between 5 to 8 months. The most common complication was soft tissue irritation at the proximal tibia due to protruding Ender nails. Seven (12. 6 %) patients were affected with this problem and the nails were removed in 5 of them. Conclusion – If used correctly, Ender nail can be an effective tool in treatment of tibial shaft fractures especially in centers with lower access to sophisticated and expensive facilities...|$|E
30|$|The use of reamed (RN) or unreamed (URN) {{intramedullary}} nailing remains controversial, {{especially in}} relation to open fractures. Reamed intramedullary nailing provides better stability because of increased contact between the <b>nail</b> and <b>medullary</b> canal. Larger <b>nails</b> {{can be used in}} order to lessen failure due to fatigue. Reaming is also believed to increase operative time, blood loss, fracture comminution and create a ramping effect. On the other hand, unreamed nails are usually simpler to use and can be inserted more quickly, but their smaller diameter provides less rigid fixation. The literature seems to indicate that the advantages (high union rate, less revisions, fewer non-unions) of the reamed nails are more important than the disadvantages (prolonged surgical time, blood loss) [9, 12, 13, 26]. The authors believe that despite the unquestionable advantages of the reaming technique, unreamed nails could be used in selected cases that take into consideration the patient’s health status and the surgeon’s capabilities.|$|R
