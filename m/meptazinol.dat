40|$|Abstract — The {{effects of}} <b>meptazinol</b> and some opioid {{agonists}} and antagonists were studied on opioid-naive guinea-pig ileum (GPIN) and ileum taken from morphine-dependent guinea-pigs (GPID). <b>Meptazinol</b> produced a biphasic effect in GPIN and GPID with a {{depression of the}} electrically induced twitch response at lower concentrations and contractural potentiation at higher concentrations. The effects of <b>meptazinol</b> in both GPIN and GPID were similar, thus distinguishing it from the other opioid agonists and antagonists which produced differential effects on these tissues. In tnorphine-pelletted rats, <b>meptazinol</b> (5 mg/kg i. p.) did not produce notable withdrawal as measured by behavioural observation. However, <b>meptazinol</b> (30 mg/kg i. p.) enhanced the signs associated with cholinergic activation. It is suggested that <b>meptazinol</b> possesses a cholinergic component and that the morphine-withdrawal signs observed to the higher <b>meptazinol</b> dose were more probably attributable to cholinergic stimulation rather than any underlying opioid-precipitated withdrawal...|$|E

The degree of analgesia, subjectively assessed, was good with both <b>meptazinol</b> and pethidine; although <b>meptazinol</b> produced significantly more nausea than did pethidine (P< 0. 01), {{there was no}} statistically significant difference in the frequency of other side-effects. Over 24 h average consumption of <b>meptazinol</b> was 2. 4 times that of pethidine, suggesting that, when given by i. v. injection, <b>meptazinol</b> is less potent than pethidine. <b>Meptazinol</b> (m-(3 -ethyl-l-methyl hexahydro- 1 -H-azepin- 3 -yl) phenol hydrochloride), an opiate antagonist, has been shown in animal studies to have potent analgesic effects and low dependence liability (Goode and White, 1971).

40|$|The {{prophylactic}} {{action of}} <b>meptazinol</b> against physostigmine- and neostigmine-induced lethality was evaluated in mice. <b>Meptazinol</b> {{proved to be}} effective against physostigmine (1 mg kg- 1 i. p.), but not against neostigmine (0. 5 mg kg- 1 i. p.). The antagonism by <b>meptazinol</b> of physostigmine-induced poisoning was maximal when the drug was administered 15 min before physostigmine. Under these conditions the ED 50 (95 % confidence limits) of <b>meptazinol</b> was 24 (22. 0 - 26. 1) mg kg- 1 s. c. A 30 mg kg- 1 dose of the drug prevented lethality in 89 % of the animals. The action of <b>meptazinol</b> was not antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride (2 mg kg- 1 i. p.), injected 10 min before <b>meptazinol.</b> Pretreatment of mice with 30 mg kg- 1 <b>meptazinol</b> 15 min before physostigmine (1 mg kg- 1) poisoning increased brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity on average, from 8 to 31 % of control values. The protection of cholinesterases against physostigmine- and neostigmine-induced inactivation was demonstrated in vitro directly on purified preparations of the enzymes using a dilution method. The ED 50 values (95 % confidence limits) for the protective effect of <b>meptazinol</b> of electric eel AChE against 1 and 3 microM physostigmine and 1 microM neostigmine were 2. 6 (1. 4 - 4. 9), 9. 5 (5 - 18) and 3 (1. 6 - 5. 7) microM, respectively, while for protection of horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) against the same inhibitors, the ED 50 values were 12 (5. 4 - 26. 4), 42 (27 - 65. 1) and 8 (3. 6 - 17. 6) microM, respectively.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} the opioid mixed agonist-antagonist, <b>meptazinol,</b> and the opioid antagonist, naloxone, have been evaluated in conscious rats, anaesthetized rats and anaesthetized cats following the induction of haemorrhagic shock. The mean arterial pressure of conscious rats decreased by 17 - 29 mmHg following a haemorrhage of 20 % of blood volume. <b>Meptazinol</b> (17 mg kg- 1, i. m.) administered after haemorrhage evoked a rapid and sustained increase in mean arterial pressure to pre-haemorrhage levels. Naloxone (10 mg kg- 1, i. v.) also increased mean arterial pressure to a level significantly higher than post-haemorrhage values. Neither haemorrhage nor subsequent drug treatments evoked {{significant changes in the}} heart rates of conscious rats. In anaesthetized rats, 20 % haemorrhage evoked decreases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. Blood flow to the heart, skin, skeletal muscle, kidneys, spleen and liver (arterial) was decreased. <b>Meptazinol</b> and naloxone increased blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, but did not significantly alter heart rate or cardiac output. Hepatic arterial flow decreased further in both drug and vehicle treated groups. In addition <b>meptazinol</b> slightly reduced skeletal muscle flow. In anaesthetized cats 40 % haemorrhage decreased mean arterial pressure by 46 +/- 3 mmHg. An intravenous infusion of either <b>meptazinol</b> or naloxone (cumulative 2 mg kg- 1, i. v.) partially restored blood pressure.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to prolong {{analgesia}} and minimize central depressant effects, {{there has been much}} recent interest in the administration of opioid analgesics by the intrathecal route (Yaksh and Rudy, 1976; Winnie, 1980). Although in terms of "efficacy " this practice has achieved considerable success, a disturbing feature has been the appearance of severe respiratory depression in some patients several hours after administration (Glynn et al., 1979; Davies, Cleaver-Tolhurst and James, 1980 a, b). The precise mechanism is unknown; however, it is likely that this effect could arise from the passage of drug cranially up the spinal canal, redistribution via the systemic circulation (Covino et al., 1980), or a more localized action on sensory motor neurones caused by the physicochemical properties of the agents (Yaksh and Reddy. 1981). The novel opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic, <b>meptazinol,</b> has been used by i. v. and i. m. routes in the treatment of severe pain (Cohen et al., 1983; Paymaster, 1983; Robson, 1983).

After recovery from inhalation anaesthesia (without opiates or a local anaesthetic) pain relief and chemoreceptor carbon dioxide tolerance were assessed before and at various times after starting the analgesic infusion. A similar degree of pain relief was found after 10 min in Groups I and II, which lasted until the end of observation period (20 h). Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower in Group II than in Groups I and III, and respiratory rate fell in Groups I and II. After 6 h arterial carbon dioxide tensions (PaCO 2) became significantly higher in Group II than Group III. The maximum percentage fall in mean tidal volume (VT) and expired minute volume (0 VE) from the preinjection values was significant in Groups I and II. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (PETCO 2) and PaCO 2 were significantly higher after 20 h of infusion in Group II compared to Group I. The slope of 0 VE/PETCO 2 () was increased in Group I and it was significantly reduced in Group II.

Forty consenting patients were studied after cholecystectomy {{in a double}} blind trial using increments of buprenorphine (0. 15 mg), <b>meptazinol</b> (50 mg), morphine (5 mg), and pethidine (50 mg). Most patients attained good levels of pain relief (mean analogue pain score 36. 5), comparable to intravenous on demand analgesia. There were no technical complications. Significant {{differences were found between}} drugs in dizziness (pethidine produced the worst score) but not with other side effects. Buprenorphine produced longer lasting analgesia than <b>meptazinol</b> or pethidine and also gave the lowest pain scores. Patterns of analgesic consumption were the same as with intravenous on demand systems, but larger amounts of drug were generally used. Relative analgesic potencies derived from drug consumption rates were also consistent with those from intravenous on demand studies. An on demand intramuscular analgesic system offers a simple but effective means of relieving severe postoperative pain...|$|E
40|$|Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden siliciumhaltige Derivate des allosteren Modulators W 84 und Sila-Analoga der Wirkstoffe <b>Meptazinol</b> und Trifluperidol synthetisiert. Weiterhin wurden potentielle holzige Riechstoffe dargestellt. Zudem wurde im Zuge der Synthese des Sila-Analogons von Trifluperidol ein Beitrag zur Etablierung der 2, 4, 6 -Trimethoxyphenyl-Einheit als Schutzgruppe für das Silicium-Atom geleistet. Ebenso wurde die Anwendbarkeit der Olefin-Metathese-Reaktion und der Gold(I) -katalysierten intramolekularen Hydroaminierung als präparative Methoden zum Aufbau von 3 -Silazepan- bzw. 3 -Silapyrrolidin-Derivaten untersucht. In this work, silicon-containing {{derivatives}} of the allosteric modulator W 84 and sila-analogues of {{the drugs}} <b>meptazinol</b> and trifluperidol were synthesized. In addition, compounds with potentially woody scent were prepared. In {{the course of the}} synthesis of the silicon analogue of trifluperidol, a contribution was made to the establishment of the 2, 4, 6 -trimethoxyphenyl moiety as protecting group for the silicon atom. Furthermore, the utilization of the olefin-metathesis reaction and the gold(I) -catalyzed hydroamination reaction as preparative tools for the synthesis of 3 -silazepane or 3 -silapyrrolidine derivatives was investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{potency of}} opiates for suppressing {{oxytocin}} release {{relative to their}} potency as analgesics was tested in lactating rats. Oxytocin release was evoked by the sucking of the young in urethane-anaesthetized and unanaesthetized rats, and was detected by the characteristic behaviour of the young and milk yield respectively. The tail-flick test, using noxious radiant heat, {{was used to assess}} analgesia. Intraperitoneal injection of morphine (1 mg kg- 1 and 5 mg kg- 1) significantly reduced milk yield in unanaesthetized rats. Urethane-anaesthetized rats displayed a pattern of reflex milk-ejection responses similar to that found in conscious rats. This reflex was significantly inhibited in a dose-related, naloxone-reversible manner by buprenorphine (ED 50 0. 18 mg kg- 1), <b>meptazinol</b> (ED 50 : 14. 0 mg kg- 1), morphine (ED 50 : 0. 67 mg kg- 1), pentazocine (ED 50 : 15. 0 mg kg- 1) and pethidine (ED 50 : 7. 9 mg kg- 1). Although intraperitoneal injection of morphine (5 mg kg- 1) abolished the increase in intramammary pressure occurring at reflex milk-ejection, that evoked by intravenous oxytocin (0. 5 - 1 mu) was unaffected. Each opiate also caused significant, dose-related, naloxone-reversible increases in tail-flick latency. The ED 50 doses were buprenorphine (ED 50 : 0. 14 mg kg- 1), <b>meptazinol</b> (ED 50 : 12. 5 mg kg- 1), morphine (ED 50 : 5. 0 mg kg- 1), pentazocine (ED 50 : 12. 5 mg kg- 1) and pethidine (ED 50 : 6. 1 mg kg- 1). The order of potency for analgesia and for suppression of oxytocin release were identical, namely: buprenorphine greater than morphine greater than pethidine greater than <b>meptazinol</b> greater than pentazocine. The results obtained with lactating rats suggest that secretion of the hormone oxytocin is substantially reduced during opiate-induced analgesia...|$|E

40|$|Two {{consecutive}} {{studies were}} undertaken {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of acupuncture as an antiemetic used in addition to premedication with opioids in patients undergoing minor gynaecological operations. In the first study 25 of the 50 patients underwent acupuncture immediately after premedication with 100 mg <b>meptazinol,</b> the rest receiving the drug alone, and in the second 75 patients were allocated randomly to one of three groups: a group receiving 10 mg nalbuphine and acupuncture, a group receiving premedication and dummy acupuncture, and a group receiving premedication alone. Manual needling for five minutes at the P 6 acupuncture point (Neiguan) resulted in a significant reduction in perioperative nausea and vomiting in the 50 patients who underwent acupuncture compared with the 75 patients who received no acupuncture. These findings cannot be explained, but it is recommended that the use of acupuncture as an antiemetic should be explored further...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidural}} {{route is}} still considered {{the gold standard for}} labour analgesia, although it is not without serious consequences when incorrect placement goes unrecognized, e. g. in case of intravascular, intrathecal and subdural placements. Until now {{there has not been a}} viable alternative to epidural analgesia especially in view of the neonatal outcome and the need for respiratory support when long-acting opioids are used via the parenteral route. Pethidine and <b>meptazinol</b> are far from ideal having been described as providing rather sedation than analgesia, affecting the cardiotocograph (CTG), causing fetal acidosis and having active metabolites with prolonged half-lives especially in the neonate. Despite these obvious shortcomings, intramuscular and intravenously administered pethidine and comparable substances are still frequently used in delivery units. Since the end of the 90 ths remifentanil administered in a patient-controlled mode (PCA) had been reported as a useful alternative for labour analgesia in those women who either don't want, can't have or don't need epidural analgesia...|$|E
