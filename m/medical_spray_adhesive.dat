40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>spray</b> in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). METHODS: Patients who underwent ESD between January 2009 and June 2012 (n = 173) {{were enrolled in the}} prospective randomized study. Two patients undergoing surgery due to severe intraoperative hemorrhage and failed hemostasis were excluded, and the remaining 171 patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (medical adhesive group, n = 89) and group B (control group, n = 82). In group A, a <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>spray</b> was evenly applied after routine electrocoagulation and hemostasis using hemostatic clip after ESD. Patients in group B only treated with routine wound management. Intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and compared. RESULTS: In all 171 patients, ESD was successfully completed. There {{was no significant difference in}} the average treatment time between groups A and B (59. 4 min vs 55. 0 min, respectively). The average length of hospital stay was significantly different between group A and B (8. 89 d vs 9. 90 d, respectively). The incidence of intraoperative perforation was 10. 1 % in group A and 9. 8 % in group B, and was not significantly different between the two groups. In all cases, perforations were successfully managed endoscopically and with conservative treatment. The incidence of postoperative delayed bleeding in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (0. 00 % vs 4. 88 %, respectively). CONCLUSION: ESD is an effective minimally invasive treatment for gastrointestinal precancerous lesions or early-stage gastrointestinal cancer. <b>Medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>spray</b> is effective in preventing delayed bleeding after ESD, and can thus reduce the average length of hospital stay...|$|R
40|$|Although {{techniques}} and instruments for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) have improved, bleeding {{is still the}} most common complication. Minimizing the occurrence of bleeding is important because blood can interfere with subsequent procedures. Generally, ESD-related bleeding can be divided into intraprocedural and postprocedural bleedings. Postprocedural bleeding can be further classi-fied into early post-ESD bleeding which occurs within 48 hours after ESD and late post-ESD bleeding which occurs later than 48 hours after ESD. A basic principle for avoiding intraprocedural bleeding is to watch for vessels and coagulate them before cutting. Several countertraction devices have been designed to minimize intraprocedural bleeding. Methods for reducing postprocedural bleeding in-clude administration of proton-pump inhibitors or prophylactic coagulation after ESD. <b>Medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>spray</b> such as n-butyl- 2 -cyano-acrylate is also an option for preventing postprocedural bleeding. Various endoscopic treatment modalities are used for both intraproce-dural and postprocedural bleeding. However, hemoclipping is infrequently used during ESD because the clips interfere with subsequent resection. Bleeding that occurs as a result of ESD can usually be managed easily. Nonetheless, more effective ways to prevent bleeding, including reliable ESD techniques, must be developed...|$|R

HA- 3676 - 20131 -Bromopropane (1 -BP) is {{a solvent}} {{that is used}} in degreasing, dry cleaning, <b>spray</b> <b>adhesives,</b> and aerosol solvents. Occupational {{exposure}} to 1 -BP {{has been linked to}} neurological illnesses. Animal studies show that 1 -BP may also cause cancer and reproductive disorders. Controls and personal protective equipment are available to protect workers from 1 -BP exposure. Exposure to 1 -BP can cause irritation (for example, of the eyes, mucous membranes, upper airways and skin) and can damage the nervous system. Neurologic effects can appear as headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness, slurred speech, confusion, difficulty walking, muscle twitching, and/or loss of feeling in arms and legs [Ichihara et al. 2012]. These effects may continue among affected persons even after exposure to 1 -BP has ended [Majersik et al. 2007]. As with many other solvents, workers can be exposed to 1 -BP by breathing in vapor or mists of spray. Workers might also be exposed if the chemical touches their skin because it can be absorbed [Hanley et al. 2006; Frasch et al. 2011]. Additionally, the risk of health effects to workers increases the longer they work with or near 1 -BP. Impacts on health have been seen in workers after exposures for as little as two days, although symptoms are more commonly associated with longer exposure [Ichihara et al. 2012]. Federal OSHA does not currently have a specific exposure standard for 1 -BP; however, employers are required by law to keep their workers safe from this recognized hazard. Degreasing, <b>spray</b> <b>adhesive,</b> aerosol solvent and dry cleaning operations expose workers to air concentrations of 1 -BP greater than the limits set by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).

Usually, interface tracking methods are used to simulate the primary atomization while a dispersed method such as the Lagrangian particle-tracking approach {{may be used to}} model the final spray. Despite progresses in numerical methods and computer performance, complete simulation of atomization and spray remains inaccessible for many applications. A possibility consists to extend the ELSA approach to the well-established LES framework combined with an interface density equation for subgrid scales. A postulated transport equation of the interface density is used to describe the subgrid spray formation ranging from interface wrinkling, ligaments, and sheets up to the droplets. The objective of our work is to extend the LES ELSA method developed by Chesnel et al. into a general purpose solver OpenFOAM. The method has been adapted for unstructured mesh to address applications. The interface capturing method is based on the transport of a liquid volume fraction, αl. To sustain the sharp gradient of αl an additional compressive term is added to the equation. LES formulation induced a subgrid term SGSαl that is not compatible with numerical procedure used to capture the interface. The advantage of the compressive method is the possibility to switch it off when SGSαl become important, i. e. when the interface fluctuations become important at subgrid scale. In order to improve ELSA method a coupling with Lagrangian particle will be initialized. Lagrangian particle are create when liquid structure become droplet. The diameter and the number of particle are determined via the liquid volume fraction and via the interface density. The Eulerian equations have to be linked to the Lagrangian phase, this is achieved through the liquid turbulent diffusion flux closure.
