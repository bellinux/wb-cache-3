50|$|Because the United States {{does not}} {{recognise}} the international ECE Regulations on auto safety components and constructions, but rather maintains its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, {{the front of}} the B4 had to be specially redesigned for vehicles sold in North America.

Instead of the dual-reflector headlamps, a single-reflector design was used inboard of an amber combination turn signal, parking, and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamp</b> and reflector wrapping around the corner, and fog lamps smaller than the rest-of-world items were placed the corners of the bumper air duct.|$|R

Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp, made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams, along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal, are all realised with LEDs.

Herein, we report the preparation of rod-shaped layer-by-layer (LbL) -assembled polymer hydrogel capsules with tunable aspect ratios (ARs). By templating spherical and rodlike silica particles, disulfide-stabilized poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogel capsules (PMA HCs) with different ARs (from 1 to 4) are generated. The influence of capsule AR on cellular internalization and intracellular fate was quantitatively investigated by flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. These experiments reveal that the cellular internalization kinetics of PMA HCs are dependent on the AR, with spherical capsules being internalized more rapidly and {{to a greater extent}} compared with rod-shaped capsules. In contrast, the capsules with different ARs are colocalized with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1, suggesting that the lysosomal compartmentalization is independent of shape for these soft polymer capsules.

40|$|It {{is hard to}} find an area {{of biology}} in which {{autophagy}} is not involved. In fact, the topic extends beyond scientific research to stimulate intellectual exercise and entertainment-autophagy has found its way into a crossword puzzle (Klionsky, 2013). We have found yet another function of autophagy while searching for a better treatment for Pompe disease, a devastating metabolic myopathy resulting from excessive lysosomal glycogen storage. To relieve this glycogen burden, we stimulated lysosomal exocytosis through upregulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). Overexpression of TFEB in Pompe muscle clears the cells of enlarged lysosomes, reduces glycogen levels, and alleviates autophagic buildup, the major secondary abnormality in Pompe disease. Unexpectedly, the process of exocytosis {{does not seem to be}} a purely lysosomal event; vesicles arranged along the plasma membrane are double-labeled with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 and the autophagosomal marker LC 3, indicating that TFEB induces the exocytosis of autolysosomes. Furthermore, the effects of TFEB are almost abrogated in autophagy-deficient Pompe mice, suggesting a previously unrecognized role of autophagy in TFEB-mediated cellular clearance...|$|R
40|$|TLR 9 is a {{receptor}} for oligodeoxynucleotides {{that contain}} unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG). Because TLR 9 {{resides in the}} endoplasmic reticulum during the quiescence state, CpG binding to TLR 9 requires membrane trafficking, which includes the maturation of the CpG-containing endosome. In the present study, we examined the role of PIKfyve, a phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate 5 -kinase, in the regulation of TLR 9 signaling. The PIKfyve inhibitor YM 201636 inhibited co-localization of the CpG-containing endosome with LysoTracker, which stains acidic organelle, and with TLR 9. YM 201636 increased the co-localization of CpG with the early endosome marker EEA 1 but decreased co-localization with the late endosome <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1. Similar results were obtained in Raw 264. 7 cells containing shRNA that targets PIKfyve.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of the B. ovis abcEDCBA-encoded ABC transporter and the virB operon-encoded Type IV Secretion System (T 4 SS) during intracellular survival of B. ovis in ovine peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages.

We here investigated the trafficking of B. pertussis upon entry into human macrophages. During the first hours following phagocytosis, {{a high percentage of}} bacteria were destroyed within acidic compartments positive for the lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP). However, roughly one-fourth of the bacteria taken up evade this initial killing event, remaining in nonacidic compartments. Forty-eight hours after infection, the number of intracellular bacteria per cell increased, suggesting that B. pertussis is capable of replicating in this type of compartment. Viable bacteria accumulated within phagosomal compartments positive for the early endosomal marker Rab 5 but not the late endosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP.</b> Moreover, B. pertussis-containing phagosomes acquired exogenously added transferrin, indi-cating that intracellular bacteria have access to extracellular components and essential nutrients via the host cell recycling pathway.

40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric deficits, associated with predominant loss of striatal neurons and is caused by polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. Mutant huntingtin protein and its fragments are resistant to protein degradation and produce a blockade of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In HD models, the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin aggravates protein accumulation and the inductor of autophagy, trehalose, diminishes it. We have investigated the effects of epoxomicin and trehalose in skin fibroblasts of control and HD patients. Untreated HD fibroblasts have increased the levels of ubiquitinized proteins {{and higher levels of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), huntingtin and the autophagy <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 2 A.

Epoxomicin increases the activated caspase- 3, HSP 70, huntingtin, ubiquitinated proteins and ROS levels in both HD and controls. Treatment with trehalose counteracts the increase in ROS, ubiquitinated proteins, huntingtin and activated caspase- 3 levels induced by epoxomicin, and also increases the LC 3 levels more in HD fibroblast than controls.

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} elicits {{the first wave of}} immune {{responses}} against pathogen infection. Its operational modes are complex and have yet to be defined. Here, we report the identification of an innate immune regulator termed TAPE (TBK 1 -associated protein in endolysosomes), previously known as CC 2 D 1 A/Freud- 1 /Aki- 1, which modulates the TLR 3 and TLR 4 pathways. We found that TAPE activated the TBK 1, NF-κB, and ERK pathways leading to IFN-β and inflammatory cytokine induction. TAPE was shown to colocalize with endosomal marker Rab 5 and lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 in mammalian cells, suggesting that TAPE resided in endolysosomes. Knockdown of TAPE selectively impaired the TLR 3 and endocytic TLR 4 pathways to IFN-β induction. Furthermore, TAPE interacted and synergized with Trif to activate IFN-β. TAPE knockdown failed to block Trif-mediated IFN-β induction, whereas Trif knockdown impaired the TLR 3 and TAPE cooperation on IFN-β induction, suggesting that TAPE acts upstream of Trif. Together, our data demonstrate a central role for TAPE in linking TLR 3 and TLR 4 to innate immune defenses at an early step...|$|R
40|$|Yersinia pestis is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that causes}} the disease known as plague. During infection of macrophages Y. pestis actively evades the normal phagosomal maturation pathway to establish a replicative niche within the cell. However, the mecha-nisms used by Y. pestis to subvert killing by the macrophage are unknown. Host Rab GTPases are central mediators of vesicular trafficking and are commonly targeted by bacte-rial pathogens to alter phagosome maturation and killing by macrophages. Here we demon-strate {{for the first time}} that host Rab 1 b is required for Y. pestis to effectively evade killing by macrophages. We also show that Rab 1 b is specifically recruited to the Yersinia containing vacuole (YCV) and that Y. pestis is unable to subvert YCV acidification when Rab 1 b expres-sion is knocked down in macrophages. Furthermore, Rab 1 b knockdown also altered the fre-quency of association between the YCV with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1, suggesting that Rab 1 b recruitment to the YCV directly inhibits phagosome maturation. Finally, we show that Rab 1 b knockdown also impacts the pH of the Legionella pneumophila containing vacuole, another pathogen that recruits Rab 1 b to its vacuole.

Further studies performed in the human macrophage cell line THP- 1 revealed intracellular survival and persistence of P. acnes but no intracellular replication or escape from the host cell. Confocal analyses of phagosome acidification and maturation were performed. Acidification of P. acnes-containing phagosomes was observed at 6 h postinfection but then lost again, indicative of cytosolic escape of P. acnes or intraphagosomal pH neutralization. No colocalization with the lysosomal <b>markers</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 and cathepsin D was observed, implying that the P. acnes-containing phagosome does not fuse with lysosomes.

40|$|AbstractGTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH), an {{oligomeric}} protein {{composed of}} 10 identical subunits, {{is required for}} the synthesis of neurotransmitters; mutations in GCH are associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and hyperphenylalaninemia. Mutated GCH proteins are unstable and prone to dominant-negative effect. We show herein that expression of the GCH mutant GCH- 201 E or the splicing variant GCH-II caused intracellular inclusion bodies. When Hsp 27 was expressed together with the GCH mutants, Hsp 27 expression decreased the formation of inclusion bodies by GCH (as assessed by immunofluorescence) and decreased the amount of insoluble GCH mutant proteins (as assessed by Western blot). Transfection of pcDNA-Hsp 27 -S 3 D, a phosphorylation-mimicry Hsp 27 mutant, was more effective at the mutated GCH proteins than transfection with pcDNA-Hsp 27, but okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, enhanced the effect of pcDNA-Hsp 27. Hsp 27 -S 3 D also abolished the dominant-negative action of GCH-II. The mutated GCH proteins interacted with the wild-type GCH protein; the inclusion bodies were positive for lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1, soluble in 2 % SDS, and were not ubiquitinated.

40|$|Abstract Pompe {{disease is}} a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Recently, small molecule pharmacological chaperones {{have been shown to}} increase protein stability and cellular levels for mutant lysosomal enzymes and have emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LSDs. In this study, we characterized the pharmacological chaperone 1 -deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) on 76 different mutant forms of GAA identified in Pompe disease. DNJ significantly increased enzyme activity and protein levels for 16 different GAA mutants in patient-derived fibroblasts and in transiently transfected COS- 7 cells. Additionally, DNJ increased the processing of these GAA mutants to their mature lysosomal forms, suggesting facilitated trafficking through the secretory pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed increased colocalization of GAA with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 2 after incubation with DNJ, confirming increased lysosomal trafficking. Lastly, a GAA structural model was constructed based on the related eukaryotic glucosidase maltase-glucoamylase.

The pathways underlying the removal of dead cells in homeostatic apoptosis have been extensively studied, but little is known regarding how cells that undergo apoptotic death during mycobacterial infection are removed. This study shows that macrophages induced to undergo apoptosis with mycobacteria cell wall proteins are engulfed by J- 774 A. 1 monocytic cells through the mannose receptor. This demonstration was achieved through assays in which phagocytosis was inhibited with a blocking anti-mannose receptor antibody and with mannose receptor competitor sugars. Moreover, elimination of the mannose receptor by a specific siRNA significantly diminished {{the expression of the}} mannose receptor and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. As shown by immunofluorescence, engulfed apoptotic bodies are initially located in Rab 5 -positive phagosomes, which mature to express the phagolysosome <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1.

Exposure of HUVEC to SMER 28, an mTOR-independent inducer of autophagy, enhanced proLC 3 and LC 3 A, B-I protein expression and accelerated the autophagic flux. Pre-treatment of HUVEC with SMER 28 protected against the blockage of autophagic flux induced by IR and conferred radio-resistance.
