40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is, by using tree {{conductive}} Swedish newspapers, see how thesubmarine violations that Sweden suffered during 1980 s, was depicted in the Swedish press in terms of threats. Two major submarine violations will be investigated in this paper, U 137 -incident in Karlskrona archipelago in 1981 and Hårsfjärden-incident in Stockholm archipelago in 1982. To achieve the purpose, I use a qualitativ method and a threatperspective to answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> These <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> instance - From which nation, according to press reports, comes the threat? - What is, according to the press, threatened? The {{results show that the}} press saw the submarine violations as a major and serious threat that mainly come from Soviet Union. The relationship between Sweden and Soviet became strained because of the submarine violations. The submarine threat for example the population, neutrality and military areas. Antother result that can be seen is that readers of different newspapers have different preceptions of threat because the newspaper in many cases put their own interpretation of the threat. A clear example can be seen in that the reader´s preception will change, depending on how much criticism the press gives to the government an millitary...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study the view of six teachers, working in three {{different}} field areas, on ethics questions and ethics teaching in schools, from a global perspective. My second aim was to analyze whether there was any cooperation between these different field areas or between them and others, {{in order to improve}} the ethics teaching in schools. <b>My</b> research <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> intended <b>for</b> one teacher in a Swedish school, three teachers in a Brazilian school, one Swedish missionary and one Swedish senior lecturer in ethics. The research questions basically centre on how these teachers would define concepts such as ethics and global ethics, what kind of ethics <b>questions</b> they feel <b>are</b> important <b>for</b> the school to convey and if there is any form of cooperation between teachers in Swedish/Brazilian schools and different organizations, designed to improve the ethics teaching in schools from a global perspective. On the basis of the results of my questionnaires I find the definition of ethics more or less equal among the six teachers. They relate ethics to moral philosophy and other questions such as what is right, wrong, good and evil. The teachers also believe ethics contains a reflection on global matters, like the environment, poverty and peace. Five out of six teachers define global ethics with conceptions like global responsibility, respect for future generations, global consensus, comprehension and tolerance. One of the teachers does not believe in global ethics but in groups that could establish some common values to be achieved. All six teachers feel it is important to bring questions related to Human Rights to the fore in schools. These ethics questions would touch on increased egoism, responsibility, respect for the environment, respect for differences, solidarity, tolerance, attitudes and sexual morals. According to the teachers these matters should be practiced and studied from a micro, macro and gender perspective. My results show that cooperation does exist between the Swedish/Brazilian schools and different organizations and institutions. There is cooperation between The Church of Sweden Mission and Brazilian organizations, but there are no exchanges between Swedish schools and schools outside Europe. One way to improve ethics teaching and facilitate exchanges between schools from a global perspective could be to globalize the curriculum. With a globalized curriculum teachers could give the students the global context they need in global society...|$|R

40|$|In {{the studies}} of {{contemporary}} electronic media artifacts and their effects on society, television, satellites, and computers have been extensively investigated and their various impacts well documented. With regards to telecommunication technologies, academic scholarship is somewhat less, with most comment being restricted to either historic evolution, or technical description. Exceptions to this are, Marvin 2 ̆ 7 s reference to the telephone in her publication, When Old Technologies Were New: Thinking About Electronic Communication in the Late Nineteenth Century (1988, and Umble 2 ̆ 7 s The Amish and the telephone: resistance and reconstruction (1992). Both of these publications <b>are</b> used <b>for</b> supporting arguments in my thesis investigating the societal and cultural effects {{associated with the use}} of the mobile telephone. I have selected this subject for my thesis, as I can find no previous significant scholarship relating to this particular field, and my research will redress this imbalance. In my thesis I present a contextual overview of the mobile telephone dealing with its historical evolution and technological change, and how its convergence with other technologies is reshaping future expectations in personal electronic communication strategies. Also within the overview I look at what conditions determine the access to becoming a mobile telephone user, the service expectations of the users against what is provided by the service suppliers, and how the service suppliers 2 ̆ 7 advertising strategies are driving a burgeoning market in mobile communications. The main thrust of my research is contained within arguments concerning the three major research <b>questions.</b> <b>My</b> primary focus <b>is</b> on the relationships between place, time, and space with the mobile telephone. In past research, Meyrowitz (1985) and Giddens (1990) and (1991) have categorically stated that place is no longer important, as electronic media have permeated the confines of encapsulated areas, and transported social relationships away from the necessity for face to face interaction. I argue that the mobile telephone has re-instated the importance of place by its capacity to intrude into any place, at the will of its user, invading personal privacy of non-users within both private and public arenas. Further I argue that place is assuming importance through its exposure to environmental degradation, with the building of transmission towers to supply the mobile telephone service. My secondary focus is on how the mobile telephone is affecting the workplace. To investigate this problem i have researched the phenomenon of telecommuting, and used the findings as a base for my investigations into the mobile office. Many of the problems relate to control, where extreme difficulties arise for authorities to manage effectively their charges when determining workers 2 ̆ 7 welfare, health regulations, and supervisory duties. In the case of the employees, the freedom from direct supervision, and the flexibility to organise work times to suit their personal requirements are stated advantages. The growth of mobile office working has the potential to change the traditional values of encapsulated workplaces, and as such will require different rules and strategies to be negotiated between employers and employees to adequately safeguard each others’ interests. Prior to my final major focus, the mobile telephone and 2 ̆ 7 monopolies of knowledge 2 ̆ 7 (Innis, 1949, p. 5), I look at technological convergence, and change. I examine the convergence of media technologies to show that the phenomenon is not new, but historically, a driving force behind the development of new communication systems. In the section titled 2 ̆ 7 change 2 ̆ 7, I document how the mobile telephone has been accepted into many different societies and sub-cultures, bringing change to their communication habits and expectations. The sections on technological convergence, and change lead my research into the final major focus, where I examine the link between the mobile telephone and the creation of new ‘monopolies of knowledge 2 ̆ 7 (ibid), forming elite groups or sub-cultures which weaken the structure of community-based societies. To underpin my research focus I have used Umble (1992) to illustrate what happens when a new technology is introduced into a community-based lifestyle, creating elite groups or sub-cultures, which then challenge the basic values which support that community. Finally, in seeking information for my thesis I conducted a survey of 100 households, where I sought replies from both mobile telephone users and non-users. The response to my survey was better than most returns predicted in the literature which I read describing strategies for mail surveys. However, due to my research being original in its field, <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> general <b>for</b> the thesis subject matter, and so did not supply an abundance of information which could be used within the narrowed structure of the research questions. Nevertheless the aggregated results are included in the appendices of this thesis...|$|R
