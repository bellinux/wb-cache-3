One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy <b>milk</b> <b>proteins,</b> which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E

40|$|Associations between <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genotypes and <b>milk</b> {{production}} traits were estimated from 6803 first lactation records. Exact tests of associated hypotheses and unbiased estimates of genotype effects were from an animal model. <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> genotype effects were estimated using {{a model in}} which each <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> gene was analyzed separately (single-gene analysis) and a model in which all <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genes were analyzed simultaneously (multigene analysis). The results of the two models indicate that some effects ascribed to certain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genes in the single-gene analysis are not effects of the <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> gene itself but of linked genes. Results from this study and from literature indicate that the K-casein gene or a very closely linked gene affects protein percentage, and the ß-lactoglobulin gene or a very closely linked gene affects fat percentage. Furthermore, effects of ß-casein genotypes on milk production, fat percentage, and protein yield were significant, and ß-lactoglobulin genotypes had significant effects on <b>milk</b> production and <b>protein</b> yield.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{association}} between serum levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA antibodies and milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms in adults. METHODS: <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA antibodies were determined in serum samples of 400 subjects from five outpatient clinics in Southern Finland. Subjects {{were randomly selected from}} a total of 1900 adults undergoing laboratory investigations in primary care. All 400 participants had completed a questionnaire on abdominal symptoms and dairy consumption while waiting for the laboratory visit. The questionnaire covered the nature and frequency of gastrointestinal problems, the provoking food items, family history and allergies. Twelve serum samples were disqualified due to insufficient amount of sera. The levels of specific <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA were measured by using the ELISA technique. The association of the milk protein-specific antibody level was studied in relation to the milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms and dairy consumption. RESULTS: Subjects drinking milk (n = 265) had higher levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG in their sera than non-milk drinkers (n = 123, P < 0. 001). Subjects with gastrointestinal problems related to milk drinking (n = 119) consumed less milk but had higher <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels than those with no milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 198, P = 0. 02). Among the symptomatic subjects, those reporting dyspeptic symptoms had lower <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels than non-dyspeptics (P < 0. 05). However, dyspepsia was not associated with milk drinking (P = 0. 5). The association of high <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels with constipation was close to the level of statistical significance. Diarrhea had no association with <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG level (P = 0. 5). With regard to minor symptoms, flatulence and bloating (P = 0. 8), were not associated with <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG level. <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgA levels did not show any association with milk drinking or abdominal symptoms. The levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgA and IgG declined as the age of the subjects increased (P < 0. 004). CONCLUSION: <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG but not milk IgA seems to be associated with self-reported milk-induced gastrointestinal symptoms...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the role of insulin in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production in pasture-fed lactating ruminants (ewes and cows), using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (HEC) technique. Three experiments were carried out. In the first 2 experiments, the response of pasture-fed ewes and dairy cows to the HEC were established and compared to concentrate-fed ruminants (dairy cows and goats). Use of the HEC technique in pasture-fed ruminants did not result in an increase in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield or concentration. However, a reduction in feed intake along with maintenance of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield resulted in a change in efficiency of utilisation of dietary crude <b>protein</b> for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. This indicated that changes in blood insulin could result in changes in nutrient partitioning to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. In Experiment 3, mechanisms were examined that could maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production despite a reduction in feed intake. The arterio-venous concentration difference technique and a leucine tracer infusion were used to measure amino acid (AA) uptake and subsequent metabolism for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production under conditions imposed by the HEC. This experiment demonstrated that the HEC reduced AA supply to the mammary gland and there was a decrease in the uptake of some AA. There was no increase in mammary blood flow to compensate for this. The deficit in the ratio of AA uptake to their secretion in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> suggests the use of plasma free AA concentrations underestimates uptake of AA by the mammary gland and there are contributions by alternative sources such as peptide AA and erythrocytes. There was no decrease in leucine oxidation in the mammary gland, indicating that AA were not conserved for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production through an alteration in this mechanism. These results support the theory that the mammary gland has the ability to respond to modified precursor supply to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> output...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> {{production}} was investigated utilising two different approaches. The first model {{is one of}} intravenous infusion of atropine. Atropine, which decreases <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield, has been theorised to act either by decreasing blood somatotropin (ST) concentration or by decreasing blood amino acid (AA) concentration. Thus, the first experiment was designed to test which mechanism, or both, {{is responsible for the}} effects on <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield. Five lactating dairy cows were assigned to the following treatments which were administered intravenously: Saline (CONT), atropine (ATR), ATR + ST, ATR + AAs, and ATR + ST + AAs. Atropine treatment failed to decrease plasma ST concentration but did decrease plasma alpha-amino nitrogen concentration. Atropine treatment decreased <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield but neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs were able to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield at the CONT level when infused with ATR. It is clear that the treatments tested are not directly responsible for the decrease in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield due to ATR. Therefore, neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs appear to have direct control of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. Plasma insulin (INS) concentration was decreased and plasma IGF-I concentration was not decreased by ATR treatment. Insulin, therefore, presents itself as a candidate for direct control over <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. The second model is one of monitoring endocrine response to abomasal infusion of AAs mimicking the profile of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> with selective deletion of certain AAs. Six lactating dairy cows were subjected to the following treatments: Saline (negative control, NC), AAs (positive control, PC), PC minus methionine (PC-Met), PC minus lysine (PC-Lys), PC minus histidine (PC-His), and PC minus the branched-chain AAs (PC-BCAAs). All endocrine factors studied (ST, INS, glucagon & IGF-I) were affected by treatment. Plasma IGF-I concentration responded similarly, except for the PC-Met treatment, to <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield (Weekes and Cant, 20...|$|R
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P.

The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. <b>Milk</b> <b>proteins</b> such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

40|$|A {{positive}} phenotypic {{correlation between}} <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage and reproductive performance in dairy cattle, especially during early lactation has been recently reported. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantify the relationship between <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage and different measures of fertility in Irish, seasonal calving, dairy cattle using data from experiments comparing strains of Holstein-Friesian cows under different feeding systems. The relationships between body condition score, milk production and fertility were also investigated. The data used in this study consisted of 584 lactation records over a 5 -yr period. Principal component analysis and logistic regression was used to study the relationship between <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage and fertility performance of the cow. Greater <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage during the first 60 days post-calving was associated with better reproductive performance. The probability of a cow being submitted in the first 21 days of the breeding season increased with increased <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage during early lactation. Similarly, the probability of a cow becoming pregnant to its first service or to the whole breeding season also increased. Cows were classified as either high or low <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> percentage based on their protein percentage over the whole lactation. Cows in the high <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> group had a 7 % greater conception rate compared to cows in the low protein percentage group. In conclusion, cows with higher protein percentage, especially during early lactation are submitted earlier in the breeding season, and have a higher conception rate.
