40|$|Abstract—Given {{a set of}} {{positions}} for wireless nodes, the interference minimization problem is to assign a transmission radius (i. e., a power level) to each node such that the resulting communication graph is connected, while minimizing the maximum (respectively, average) interference. We consider the model introduced by von Rickenbach et al. (2005), in which each wireless node is represented by a point in Euclidean space on which is centred a transmission range represented by a ball, and edges in the corresponding graph are symmetric. The problem is NP-complete in two or more dimensions (Buchin 2008) and no polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known. We show how {{to solve the problem}} efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad hoc networks. If nodes are represented by a set P of n points selected uniformly and independently at random over a d-dimensional rectangular region, then the topology given by the closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of P has O(logn) <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> with high probability and O(1) expected interference. We extend the first bound to a general class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability distributions. We present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from this class; this is the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound on expected <b>maximum</b> <b>interference.</b> Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Devroye and Morin (2012) relating the <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree to the optimal <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> attainable.

The receiver-centric interference on a node is the number of other nodes whose transmission ranges cover the node. The problem of reducing interference through adjusting the nodes' transmission ranges in a connected network can be formulated as that of connecting the nodes by a spanning tree while minimizing interference. In this paper, we study minimization of the average interference and the <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> for the high-way model, where all the nodes are arbitrarily distributed on a line. Two exact algorithms are proposed. One constructs the optimal topology that minimizes the average interference among all the nodes in polynomial time, O(n 3 Δ 3), where n is the number of nodes and Δ is the maximum node degree.

40|$|The {{interference}} at {{a wireless}} node s can be modelled {{by the number}} of wireless nodes whose trans-mission ranges cover s. Given a set of positions for wireless nodes, the interference minimization problem is to assign a transmission radius (equivalently, a power level) to each node such that the resulting com-munication graph is connected, while minimizing the <b>maximum</b> <b>interference.</b> We consider the model introduced by von Rickenback et al. (2005), in which each transmission range is represented by a ball and edges in the communication graph are symmetric. The problem is NP-complete in two dimensions (Buchin 2008) and no polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known. Furthermore, even in one dimension (the highway model), the problem’s complexity is unknown and the <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> of a set of n wireless nodes can be as high as Θ(n) (von Rickenback et al. 2005). In this paper we show how to solve the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad hoc networks. In particular, we show that if node positions are represented by a set P of n points selected uniformly and independently at random over a d-dimensional rectangular region, for any fixed d, then the topology given by the closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of P has <b>maximum</b> <b>interference</b> O(logn) with high probabil-ity. We extend this bound to a general class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability distributions.

Having derived an asymptotic expression for the cumulative distribution function of the e 2 e-SNR, the asymptotic outage diversity is obtained under a limited maximum transmit power at the secondary source and relay while satisfying the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>interference</b> at the primary user. Notably, when the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>interference</b> is independent of a limited transmission power, an outage probability floor is observed. Moreover, under an unlimited transmit power at the secondary nodes, the asymptotic outage diversity is derived {{as a function of}} the interference. It can be seen that the same outage diversity gain can be achieved as in the non-spectrum-sharing CP-SC relaying system. Analytically derived asymptotic outage diversity gains for limited and unlimited transmission power cases are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|R
