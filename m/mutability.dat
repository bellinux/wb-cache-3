The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E

These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

The present paper deals with {{cases in which the}} above agents have induced well defined gene unstabilization. The term "gene unstabilization " denotes a phenomenon in which a gene mutates to one with a higher spontaneous rate of mutation. Examples of this phenomenon are: (i) the muta-tion of a stable enzyme producer to an unstable one, which mutates to enzyme nonproducer with a high spontaneous mutation rate, and (ii) the mutation of a stable prototroph to an auxotroph, which is unstable and reverts to prototrophy with a high spontaneous mutation rate. Induced mutants in both these categories will be described in this paper.

40|$|In this paper, {{theoretical}} {{examination of}} new ruin is complimented by epistemological findings garnered from a qualitative, site-specific research methodology. Chapter One examines {{the question of}} how a physically ruinous landscape might be depicted as metaphorical of broader, non-physical erosive forces, whether social, cultural or political. This query engages with aesthetic conceptualisations of new ruin in the writing of late-eighteenth century philosopher Denis Diderot and nineteenth century theorist George Simmel. I posit ruin as a point of aesthetic equilibrium between opposing forces of unity and disunity. Contemporary artists examined include Paris-born, United-States-based multimedia artist Cyprien Gaillard, and Singapore-born, Malay-Australian photomedia practitioner Simryn Gill, focusing in particular on the site-specific methodology employed by Gaillard in the video artwork Cities of Gold and Mirrors (2009). Chapter Two investigates ethnographic and art-historical precedents for artists working as foreigners, and describes my attempt to formulate an ethical research methodology in a foreign region. This chapter examines social, political and economic frameworks on Gili Meno, noting the pervasive impact of tourism.

40|$|That {{amino acid}} {{properties}} {{are responsible for}} the way protein molecules evolve is natural and is also reasonably well supported both by the structure of the genetic code and, to a large extent, by the experimental measures of the amino acid similarity. Nevertheless, there remains a significant gap between observed similarity matrices and their reconstructions from amino acid properties. Therefore, we introduce a simple theoretical model of amino acid similarity matrices, which allows splitting the matrix into two parts - one that depends only on <b>mutabilities</b> of amino acids and another that depends on pairwise similarities between them. Then the new synthetic amino acid properties are derived from the pairwise similarities and used to reconstruct similarity matrices covering a wide range of information entropies. Our model allows us to explain up to 94 % of the variability in the BLOSUM family of the amino acids similarity matrices in terms of amino acid properties. The new properties derived from amino acid similarity matrices correlate highly with properties known to be important for molecular evolution such as hydrophobicity, size, shape and charge of amino acids. This result closes the gap in our understanding of the influence of amino acids on evolution at the molecular level. The methods were applied to the single family of similarity matrices used often in general sequence homology searches, but it is general and can be used also for more specific matrices. The new synthetic properties can be used in analyzes of protein sequences in various biological applications...|$|R
40|$|Silent {{sites in}} mammals have classically been {{assumed to be}} free front {{selective}} pressures. Consequently, the synonymous substitution rate (K-s) is often used as it proxy for the Mutation rate. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates that the assumption is not valid, the mechanism by which selection acts remain Unclear. Recent work has revealed {{that the presence of}} exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in coding sequence might influence synonyomous evolution. ESEs are predominantly located near intron-exon junctions, which may explain the reduced single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density in these regions. Here we show that synonymous Sites in putative ESEs evolve more slowly than the remaining exonic sequence. Differential <b>mutabilities</b> of ESEs do not appear to explain this difference. We observe that Substitution frequency ill four-fold synonymous sites decreases its one approaches the ends of exons, consistent with the existing SNP data. This gradient is at least in part explained by ESEs being more abundant near junctions. Between-gene variation in K-s is hence partly explained by the proportion of the gene that acts as,in ESE. Given the relative abundance of ESEs and the reduced rates of synonymous divergence within them, we estimate that constraints on synonymous evolution within ESEs Causes the true mutation rate to be Underestimated by not more than similar to 8 %. We also find that K-s Outside of ESEs is much lower in alternatively spliced exons than in constitutive exons, implying that other causes of selection on synonymous mutations exist. Additionally, selection on ESEs appears to affect nonsynonymous sites and may explain why amino acid usage near intron-exon junctions is nonrandom...|$|R

Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the <b>mutability</b> of identity, how are we to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

The <b>mutability</b> of an amino acid is the ratio of the number of mutations it is involved in and the number of times it occurs in an alignment. <b>Mutability</b> measures how likely an amino acid is to mutate acceptably. Asparagine, an amino acid with a small polar side chain, was found to be the most mutable of the amino acids. [...] Cysteine and tryptophan were found to be the least mutable amino acids. The side chains for cysteine and tryptophan have less common structures: cysteine's side chain contains sulfur which participates in disulfide bonds with other cysteine molecules, and tryptophan's side chain is large and aromatic. Since there are several small polar amino acids, these extremes suggest that amino acids are more likely to acceptably mutate if their physical and chemical properties are more common among alternative amino acids.|$|E

The mutations were induced in four different regions of the X chromosome: (1) 1 A 1 - 3 E 8, (2) 6 D 1 - 8 A 5, (3) 9 E 1 - 11 A 7 and (4) 19 A 1 - 20 F 4, which together comprise {{more than one-third of the}} entire chromosome. —The analysis shows that the number of alleles found at different loci does not fit a Poisson distribution, even when the proper procedures are taken to accomodate the truncated nature of the data. However, the allele distribution fits a truncated negative binomial distribution quite well, with cytologically normal mutations fitting better than rearrangement mutations. This indicates that genes are not equimutable, as required for the data to fit a Poisson distribution. —Using the negative binomial parameters to estimate the number of genes that did not produce a detectable lethal mutation in our experiment (n 0) gave a larger number than that derived from the use of the Poisson parameter. Unfortunately, we cannot estimate the total numbers of nonvital loci, loci with undetectable phenotypes and loci having extremely low <b>mutabilities.</b> In any event, our estimate of the total vital gene number was far short of the total number of bands in the analyzed regions; yet, in several short intervals, we have found more vital genes than bands; in other intervals, fewer. We conclude that the one-band, one-gene hypothesis, in its literal sense, is not true; furthermore, it is difficult to support, even approximately. —The question of the total gene number in Drosophila will, not doubt, eventually be solved by molecular analyses, not by {{statistical analysis}} of mutation data or saturation studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} communal uneasiness and hermeneutic impasse created by suicide in twentieth-century US American literature by women. By considering how history is negotiated through suicidal acts and how literary texts are structured by self-inflicted death, I {{suggest that this}} intentional turn is most fundamentally readable through public spaces—the Middle Passage, Hiroshima, Harlem, San Francisco 2 ̆ 7 s Chinatown. My first chapter focuses on Ludwig Binswanger 2 ̆ 7 s The Case of Ellen West: An Anthropological-Clinical Study (1944), an existential analysis of a Jewish woman who killed herself in Switzerland when she was thirty-three. Along with Anne Sexton 2 ̆ 7 s poetry, West 2 ̆ 7 s writing acts {{as a prelude to}} my subsequent chapters because it makes the body inextricable from the imagination, and both inextricable from history, community, and politics. In Chapter Two, I trace the conflation of white femininity and suicide in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century literature before turning to modern novels in which women ambiguously fall to their deaths: Nella Larsen 2 ̆ 7 s Passing (1929), Mary McCarthy 2 ̆ 7 s The Group (1963), and Fae Myenne Ng 2 ̆ 7 s Bone (1993). These texts disperse intention over a field of inquiry, connecting the private act of suicide to culture less through consciousness than through public space—the fictional space of falling in public and the imagined space of a reading public. In Chapter Three, I examine revolutionary suicide in Toni Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s Beloved (1988), Sula (1973), and Song of Solomon (1977), integrating theories from Emmanuel Levinas and Huey Newton. Self-destruction operates on two revolutionary levels: within the story, as a political form of resistance and within the narrative structure, as a discursive strategy, an axis around which meanings revolve. Finally, in Chapter Four, I sketch the political terrain covered by female suicide in Adrienne Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s Funnyhouse of a Negro (1964), Velina Hasu Houston 2 ̆ 7 s Tea (1983), and Suzan-Lori Parks 2 ̆ 7 s Imperceptible <b>Mutabilities</b> in the Third Kingdom (1990). Each play extends the logic that I have traced in previous chapters, deploying the act of suicide to register the effects of colonialism, war, and white supremacy on contemporary American women 2 ̆ 7 s lives. ...|$|R
40|$|DNA repair-defective alleles of the mei- 9, mei- 41, mus- 104 and mus- 101 loci of Drosophila melanogaster were {{introduced}} into stocks bearing the UZ and SZ marker sets. Males with the UZ marker set, z 1 (zeste allele) and w+(TE) (genetically unstable white allele presumably {{caused by a}} transposable element), or the SZ marker set, z 1 and w+R (semistable white allele caused by partial duplication of the w+ locus plus transposon insert), were exposed to EMS at the first instar. After emergence, adult males bearing red spots on lemon-yellow eyes were scored as flies with somatic reversions of w+(TE) or w +R. The relative <b>mutabilities</b> (relative values of reversion frequency at an equal EMS dose) of either w+(TE) or w+R in a repair-proficient strain and in mei- 9, mei- 41, mus- 104 and mus- 101 strains were 1 :∼ 1. 2 : 0. 3 : 0. 3 : 0. 7, {{despite the fact that}} w+(TE) reverted two to three times as frequently as w+R under both the repair-proficient and repair-deficient genetic conditions. Similarly, after treatment with MMS, MNNG and ENNG, w+(TE) was somatically more mutable in the mei- 9 strain and less mutable in the mei- 41 and mus- 104 strains than in the repair-proficient strain. From these results, we propose that mutagenic lesions produced in DNA by treatment with these chemicals are converted to mutant DNA sequences via the error-prone repair mechanisms dependent on the products of the genes mei- 41 + (mei- 41 and mus- 104 being alleles of the same locus) and mus- 101 +, whereas they are eliminated by mei- 9 +-dependent excision repair. In contrast to the approximately linear responses of induced reversions of w+(TE) with ENNG in the repair-proficient, mei- 9, and mei- 41 strains, seemingly there were dosage insensitive ranges for induced reversion with MNNG in the repair-proficient and mei- 41 strains, but not for reversion in the mei- 9 strain; w+(TE) in the mus- 104 strain was virtually nonmutable with MNNG and ENNG. These results suggest that O 6 -methylguanine (O 6 MeG) produced in DNA with MNNG, but not O 6 -ethylguanine produced with ENNG, is almost completely repaired in a low dose range by constitutive activity of DNA O 6 MeG transmethylase. From the distribution of clone sizes of spontaneous revertant spots and other data, we propose that both w+(TE) and w+R have a similar tendency to spontaneously revert more frequently at early rather than at late developmental stages, probably reflecting a common property of their inserted transposons...|$|R
