60|$|People {{that build}} houses are often sore perplexed; {{but if they}} enjoy the strain of it, I'll advise them to build a boat like the Snark. Just consider, for a moment, the strain of detail. Take the engine. What is {{the best kind of}} engine--the two cycle? three cycle? four cycle? My lips are {{mutilated}} with all kinds of strange jargon, my mind is mutilated with still stranger ideas and is foot-sore and weary from travelling in new and rocky realms of thought.--Ignition methods; shall it be <b>make-and-break</b> or jump-spark? Shall dry cells or storage batteries be used? A storage battery commends itself, but it requires a dynamo. How powerful a dynamo? And when we have installed a dynamo and a storage battery, it is simply ridiculous not to light the boat with electricity. Then comes the discussion of how many lights and how many candle-power. It is a splendid idea. But electric lights will demand a more powerful storage battery, which, in turn, demands a more powerful dynamo.|$|E

5000|$|Johann Philipp Reis ( [...] ; January 7, 1834 [...] - [...] January 14, 1874) was a self-taught German {{scientist}} and inventor. In 1861, he constructed the first <b>make-and-break</b> telephone, today called the Reis telephone.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} started by a hand crank aided by the {{presence}} of a decompressor. The engine also incorporated a low-voltage magneto with <b>make-and-break</b> spark ignition. This was fitted at Jellinek's demand, replacing the antiquated hot tube system.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{nearside}} the vertically driven <b>make-and-break</b> and distributor {{is placed}} centrally {{and has a}} neat easily detachable cover over the top which also hides the sparking plugs and wiring. Here also are the water tap, the coil, pressure oil filter, dip rod, sump drain plug, starter and mechanical fuel pump" ...|$|E
50|$|A {{low tension}} <b>make-and-break</b> contact spindle rises diagonally from its {{camshaft}} {{through the main}} casting so it makes or breaks contact with the insulated contact pillar on the inlet valve cap. The necessary quick-break action comes from a coil spring {{at the bottom of}} the spindle. The high-tension sparking plugs are close alongside the contact pillars.|$|E
5000|$|Schloemer had {{to improvise}} on his [...] "motor wagon" [...] for an igniting system {{to fire the}} fuel, since at that time {{there was no such}} thing as a spark plug. He used a home-made <b>make-and-break</b> {{sparking}} mechanism consisting of two points of steel striking together causing a [...] "spark" [...] to ignite the gasoline fumes in the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Influenced by William Sturgeon and Michael Faraday, Callan {{began work}} {{on the idea of}} the {{induction}} coil in 1834. He invented the first induction coil in 1836. An induction coil produces an intermittent high-voltage alternating current from a low-voltage direct current supply. It has a primary coil consisting of a few turns of thick wire wound around an iron core and subjected to a low voltage (usually from a battery). Wound on top of this is a secondary coil made up of many turns of thin wire. An iron armature and <b>make-and-break</b> mechanism repeatedly interrupts the current to the primary coil, producing a high-voltage, rapidly alternating current in the secondary circuit.|$|E
40|$|An {{induction}} coil arrangement is demonstrated using the apparatus of Figure 1. The primary coil {{is powered by}} a DC power supply, and turned on and off by a magnetic <b>make-and-break</b> switch. The changing field in the secondary coil induces a large voltage in its windings, producing the long spark seen on the video. The operation of the {{induction coil}} is clearly explained in the video with the aid of animated graphics segments...|$|E
40|$|Tribological and arc erosion {{behaviors}} of Cu-Nb and Cu-Cr in situ composites were investigated in this dissertation. Dry sliding tests were {{performed in a}} pin-on-disk wear tester with the composites rubbing against a rotating tool steel disk under ambient conditions with a pressure of 0. 68 MPa, sliding speeds up to 2. 5 m/s, and electrical current densities up to 2. 89 MA/m[superscript] 2. Electrical arc erosion tests were performed in a <b>make-and-break</b> test set-up and a high-energy stationary arc gap test facility;Sliding friction and wear {{behaviors of}} Cu-Nb composites with and without electrical loads were studied {{in terms of the}} effects of composition, filament orientation, true deformation strain, sliding speed and annealing temperature. The Cu- 20 vol. %Nb composite had the best wear resistance among the compositions studied in both cases. Subsurface deformation was revealed by the presence of filaments {{and was one of the}} wear mechanisms for the composites. No debonding was observed in the composites during sliding. The presence of electrical current increased the temperature and promoted oxidation on wear surfaces;The contact behavior of Cu-Nb composites against tool steel was studied in terms of the contact resistance and temperature rise. Surface oxide film development, wear particle accumulation, and unsteady contact caused by sliding were found to be the major factors governing electrical contact resistance and, therefore, temperature rise. Arc erosion behavior of the composites was also investigated. It was concluded that, in low-energy <b>make-and-break</b> contacts, oxidation was the major mode of surface deterioration; and, in high-energy contact situation, melting was the major cause of surface damage. The Cu-refractory metal in situ composites had better arc erosion resistance in high-energy contacts than the commercially used Cu-W composite...|$|E
40|$|Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein {{thought to}} have descended from an alpha-actinin-like ancestor. It emerged during {{evolution}} of animals to promote integration of cells into tissues by assembling signalling and cell adhesion complexes, by enhancing the mechanical stability of membranes and by promoting assembly of specialized membrane domains. Spectrin functions as an (alphabeta([H])) (2) tetramer that cross-links transmembrane proteins, membrane lipids and the actin cytoskeleton, either directly or via adaptor proteins such as ankyrin and 4. 1. In the present paper, I review recent findings on the origins and adaptations in this system. (i) The genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis encodes alpha-, beta- and beta(Heavy) -spectrin, indicating that spectrins evolved in the immediate unicellular precursors of animals. (ii) Ankyrin and 4. 1 are not encoded in that genome, indicating that spectrin gained function during subsequent animal evolution. (iii) Protein 4. 1 gained a spectrin-binding activity {{in the evolution of}} vertebrates. (iv) Interaction of chicken or mammal beta-spectrin with PtdInsP(2) can be regulated by differential mRNA splicing, which can eliminate the PH (pleckstrin homology) domain in betaI- or betaII-spectrins; in the case of mammalian betaII-spectrin, the alternative C-terminal region encodes a phosphorylation site that regulates interaction with alpha-spectrin. (v) In mammalian evolution, the single pre-existing alpha-spectrin gene was duplicated, and one of the resulting pair (alphaI) neo-functionalized for rapid <b>make-and-break</b> of tetramers. I hypothesize that the elasticity of mammalian non-nucleated erythrocytes depends on the dynamic rearrangement of spectrin dimers/tetramers under the shearing forces experienced in circulation...|$|E
