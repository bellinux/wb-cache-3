40|$|We {{develop a}} new class of {{asynchronous}} distributed algorithms for the explicit rate control of elastic sessions in an integrated packet network. Sessions can request for minimum guaranteed rate allocations (e. g., <b>minimum</b> <b>cell</b> <b>rates</b> in the ATM context), and, under this constraint, we seek to allocate the max-min fair rates to the sessions. We capture the integrated network context by permitting the link bandwidths available to elastic sessions to be stochastically time varying. The available capacity of each link is viewed as some statistic of this stochastic process [e. g., a fraction of the mean, or a large deviations-based equivalent service capacity (ESC) ], The ESC is obtained so as to satisfy an overflow probability constraint on the buffer length. For fixed available capacity at each link, we show that the vector of max-min fair rates can be computed from the root of a certain vector equation. A distributed asynchronous stochastic approximation technique is then used to develop a provably convergent distributed algorithm for obtaining the root of the equation, even when the link flows and the available capacities are obtained from on-line measurements, The switch algorithm does not require per connection monitoring, nor does it require per connection marking of control packets. A virtual buffer based approach for on-line estimation of the ESC is utilized. We also propose techniques for handling large variations in the available capacity owing to the arrivals or departures of CBR/VBR sessions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} detection, recognition, and abundance estimation of objects representing the Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller (P. minimum) species in phytoplankton images. The species is known to cause harmful blooms in many estuarine and coastal environments. The proposed technique for solving the task exploits images of two types, namely, obtained using light and fluorescence microscopy. Various image preprocessing techniques are applied to extract a variety of features characterizing P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells</b> and cell contours. Relevant feature subsets are then selected and used in support vector machine (SVM) as well as random forest (RF) classifiers to distinguish between P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells</b> and other objects. To improve the cell abundance estimation accuracy, classification results are corrected based on probabilities of interclass misclassification. The developed algorithms were tested using 158 phytoplankton images. There were 920 P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells</b> in the images in total. The algorithms detected 98. 1 % of P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells</b> present in the images and correctly classified 98. 09 % of all detected objects. The classification accuracy of detected P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells</b> was equal to 98. 9 %, yielding a 97. 0 % overall recognition <b>rate</b> of P. <b>minimum</b> <b>cells.</b> The feature set used in this work has shown considerable tolerance to out-of-focus distortions.
