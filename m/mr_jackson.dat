25|$|St James Park was {{originally}} 'glebe land' belonging to St Paul's church and was {{divorced from the}} main church property by the laying of the Main North Railway line in the early 1870s. It {{is believed to have}} been farmed by James Triggs, the St Paul's Church verger, and part of it was developed as a cricket ground by the Papanui Cricket Club under the captaincy of John Matson with the permission of Rev. Lorenzo Moore. By 1874 the new incumbent at St Paul's, the Rev Brittan, had joined the Cricket Club as a player, but had also leased some of the land to <b>Mr</b> <b>Jackson,</b> another club member, for stock grazing. The land appears in an 1880 map as a cricket ground, but was later abandoned by the cricket club and sold to Ivorys Cool Stores in 1916. The land was purchased by the City in 1924 after residents, led by Rev Griffin, petitioned the council for a park and has both main entrances sited on St James Avenue. It was named in a Public Notice drawn up by the Christchurch City Council Bylaws and Finance committee chaired by Councilor Andrews on 30 April 1924. Rev Griffin did not live to see the park opened, and as a mark of respect Memorial Gates and a rose garden we jointly funded by the residents and the Council in his honour.|$|E

When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her front door to keep <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again.|$|E

She is trapped in her own home, her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will [...] "go distracted".

500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition â€“ that condition was that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> never admitted any wrongdoing. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go on with my life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E

Her efforts to keep her dwelling tidy are thwarted by insect and arachnid intruders who create all sorts of messes about the place: a lost beetle leaves dirty footprints in a passage and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet leaves bits of cobweb here and there. Her toad neighbour <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> lets himself into her parlour, stays for dinner, and searches her storerooms for honey but leaves a mess behind. Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse wonders if her home will ever be tidy again, but after a good night's sleep, she gives her house a fortnight's spring cleaning, polishes her little tin spoons, and holds a party for her friends.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt.

500|$|Potter's {{source for}} the {{wildlife}} and the insect drawings in Mrs. Tittlemouse were those she had executed in her early adulthood, either directly from nature or by observing specimens in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson.</b> [...] Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn for their own sake, or seem {{to be out of}} scale with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse in one picture and then smaller in another. The bees are sometimes out of scale with both the toad and the mouse.|$|E
500|$|Pop {{music critic}} Robert Hilburn {{described}} [...] "Speechless", and another song from Invincible ("Butterflies"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the acappellas in [...] "Speechless" [...] {{were enough to}} make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound. Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a [...] "shining [...] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was [...] "pure Jacksonâ€“ almost to a formulaic fault". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "produced by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> in bombastic style Ã  la Celine Dion". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, [...] "Ben".|$|E

There is real pain and pathos in these new songs... frets about painkillers, sexual promiscuity and public image. In many of them, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> seems like The Elephant Man, screaming that he is a human being...With beats crashing like metal sheets and synthesizer sounds hissing like pressurized gas, this is industrial funk." [...] He favorably compared Jackson's performance of [...] "Is It Scary" [...] to rock singer Marilyn Manson and noted the lyrics, [...] "If you want to see eccentric oddities, I'll be grotesque before your eyes". Strauss suggested that the predatory woman, [...] "Susie", from the title track, was a metaphor for AIDS. Finally, he described [...] "Morphine" [...] as [...] "chilling... <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jackson</b> sings seductively {{from the point of view}} of the drug itself...he intones sweetly".|$|E
