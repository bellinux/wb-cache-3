40|$|Neural {{systems are}} {{comprised}} of interacting units, and relevant information regarding their function or malfunction {{can be inferred}} by analyzing the statistical dependencies between the activity of each unit. Whilst correlations and mutual information are commonly used to characterize these dependencies, our objective here is to extend interactions to triplets of variables to better detect and characterize dynamic information transfer. Our approach relies on the measure of interaction information (II). The sign of II provides information as {{to the extent to}} which the interaction of variables in triplets is redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Here, based on this approach, we calculated the R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from drug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study the spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic zone (the area responsible for seizure propagation). In terms of spatial organization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S was distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made the largest contribution to high frequency bands (14 - 100 Hz), whilst S was expressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1 - 7 Hz). Thus, applying interaction information to such clinical data reveals new aspects of epileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy vs. synergy) and dynamics (fast vs. slow rhythms) of the interactions. We expect this methodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions in networks of interacting units in other setups with <b>multi-recording</b> data sets (and thus, not necessarily in epilepsy, the pathology we have approached here).

2500|$|In January 1938, Milt Gabler started {{recording}} {{for his new}} label, Commodore Records, and {{to allow}} for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: [...] "Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development." [...] The first two 12-inch recordings did {{not take advantage of}} the extra length: [...] "Carnegie Drag" [...] was 3m15s; [...] "Carnegie Jump", 2m41s. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: [...] "Embraceable You" [...] was 4m05s; [...] "Serenade to a Shylock", 4m32s. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded [...] "Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early <b>multi-record</b> release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" [...] in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about [...] minutes on a 10-inch 78rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "Soliloquy", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7m57s, longer than both sides of a standard 78rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945.|$|E
