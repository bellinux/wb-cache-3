2500|$|Marie-Anne Charlotte de Corday d'Armont (27 July 1768 – 17 July 1793), {{known as}} Charlotte Corday (...) , was {{a figure of}} the French Revolution. In 1793, she was {{executed}} by guillotine for the assassination of Jacobin leader Jean-Paul Marat, who was in part responsible for the more radical course the Revolution had taken through {{his role as a}} politician and journalist. Marat had played a substantial role in the political purge of the Girondins, with whom Corday sympathized. His murder was memorialized in the painting The Death of Marat by Jacques-Louis David, which shows Marat's dead body after Corday stabbed him in his <b>medicinal</b> <b>bath.</b> In 1847, writer Alphonse de Lamartine gave Corday the posthumous nickname l'ange de l'assassinat (the Angel of Assassination).|$|E
2500|$|Mirroring {{the actions}} {{in the first two}} quatrains of Sonnet 153, Sonnet 154 deals with an unnamed Cupid that Rowse defines as [...] "The little god of love" [...] who is {{vulnerable}} in sleep. [...] The conflict arises as a group of [...] "nymphs vowed to chastity" [...] walk by the sleeping Cupid. [...] The second quatrain explains that [...] "The fairest of them took in her hand the fire that had warmed legions of hearts". This causes a conflict because the disarmer is a virgin and has stolen the powerful torch and symbol of love (Shakespeare line 8). [...] The third quatrain introduces an even more devastating conflict as the virgin [...] "quenched this brand in a cool well near by". The plan to destroy the symbol backfires as the well takes [...] "perpetual heat from love's fire, becoming a <b>medicinal</b> <b>bath</b> for men diseased". [...] The couplet resolves these conflicts as Rowse explains, [...] "But I, my mistress' slave, came there for cure". [...] The message is learned with the concluding line that love is a strong force and cannot be conquered: [...] "Love's fire heats water, water cools not love." ...|$|E
