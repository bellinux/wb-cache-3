5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
25|$|Whatever its nature, it is {{generally}} agreed that <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which enables a being to have subjective awareness and intentionality towards their environment, to perceive and respond to stimuli {{with some kind of}} agency, and to have consciousness, including thinking and feeling.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{difference}} between {{the numbers of people}} whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday communication language. Another thing to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.|$|E

2500|$|Felicity Hampel SC, {{president}} {{of civil liberties}} group Liberty Victoria, replied in response to Hulls, [...] "Neither imprisonment in itself nor parole in itself {{is going to stop}} everybody from committing offences. What's important to bear in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a person has to be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and that might mean that somebody gets a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the dangerousness or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E
2500|$|For {{what we have}} to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the mother}} and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house. The fact that she does adds to the offensiveness of deducing that the mother can do nothing from the {{supposition}} that third parties can do nothing. [...] But it does more than this: it casts a bright light on the supposition that third parties can do nothing.|$|E

60|$|What time I was obeying him my <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> {{returning}} to <b>that</b> matter of Lampugnani's words, {{and it is}} not difficult to understand how I should arrive at the only possible conclusion they suggested. The hats of the other messengers from Vitelli, that the officer had mentioned, had been brought to Ramiro. The reason for this that at once arose in my <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> within the messenger's hat there was a second and more secret communication for the Governor.|$|R
2500|$|Time {{and memory}} have {{regularly}} {{been identified as}} two of the principal themes of Resnais's work, at least in his earlier films. He however consistently tried to modify this view of his concerns: [...] "I prefer {{to speak of the}} imaginary, or of consciousness. What interests me in the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> faculty we have to imagine {{what is going to happen}} in our heads, or to remember what has happened". He also described his films as an attempt, however imperfect, to approach the complexity of thought and its mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|Vitaly Yaroshevsky, {{deputy editor}} of Novaya Gazeta where she worked, said: [...] "The {{first thing that}} comes to <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Anna was killed for her {{professional}} activities. We don't see any other motive for this terrible crime." [...] He said Politkovskaya gave an interview to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty last week in which she said she was a witness in a criminal case against Ramzan Kadyrov in connection with abductions in Chechnya - a case based on her reporting. [...] In that same interview, she called Kadyrov the [...] "Stalin of our days".|$|E
2500|$|The primary quality {{attributed}} to the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{is considered to be}} radiant, or luminous (Pali: “pabhassara”). Teachers in the forest tradition assert that the mind is an immutable reality and that the mind is indestructible — that the mind simply “knows and does not die”. The mind is also a fixed-phenomenon (Pali: [...] "thiti-dhamma") — the mind itself does not “move” or follow out after its preoccupations, but rather receives them in place. Since the mind as a phenomenon often eludes attempts to define it, the mind is often simply described in terms of its activities: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thought}} {{which came to}} my <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Avenger <b>was</b> in great danger of being {{captured}} in short order, for I made no question but that the enemy would pursue Barney, and we were where we could not escape, save {{by way of the}} bay.|$|R
60|$|I made no reply. I was {{incapable}} of speaking, my <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> too confused. I must have time to think, I knew.

2500|$|A {{study in}} 2005 placed the Drudge Report [...] "slightly left of center". [...] "One thing people {{should keep in}} <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our data for the Drudge Report was based almost entirely on the {{articles}} that the Drudge Report lists on other Web sites", said Timothy Groseclose, {{the head of the}} study. [...] "Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media." [...] Professor Mark Liberman critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors' ties to conservative think tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Israelis {{marked the}} 40th {{anniversary of the}} Munich {{massacre}} in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, “What sticks in my <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sense of sacrilege {{and a feeling of}} horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics." [...] In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.|$|E

60|$|Sir Agravaine gulped. He {{was feeling}} more nervous {{than he had}} ever felt in his life. Never before had he risen to {{volunteer}} his services in a matter of this kind, and his state of <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of a small boy about to recite his first piece of poetry.|$|R
60|$|The idea in Randal's <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the name}} exactly fitted Mrs. Presty. He made no reply; his eyes rested in sympathy on his sister-in-law.

60|$|The two {{had come}} from Maryland to locate a homestead, and the only wonder in my <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the savages had not taken them captives before they got so far into the wilderness; for neither of them knew as much {{regarding}} woodcraft as had I on my tenth birthday.|$|R

2500|$|The {{recognized}} {{founder of}} empiricism was John Locke who proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) {{that the only}} true knowledge <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> accessible to the human <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> which <b>was</b> based on experience.

60|$|The {{resolve that}} Gwendolen {{had in her}} <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she would ask Deronda whether she ought to accept any of her husband's money--whether she might accept what would enable her to provide for her mother.

60|$|I DECLARE {{that it is}} {{impossible}} for me to describe what I felt when Priscilla's name confronted me like a written confession of guilt.
