40|$|The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) {{requires}} {{low noise}} SIS receivers for frequencies from about 80 GHz to 950 GHz with very large IF bandwidth (4 - 12 GHz). Additional requirements for these receivers are high reliability, low cost {{and the possibility}} of series production. In this paper we report on mixer designs based on standard Nb/A 10 x/Nb SIS junction technology and an optics design for ALMA band 9 (602 - 720 GHz). We present the design of a tunerless balanced waveguide SIS mixer and a quasi-optical double slot-antenna mixer as well as an optical design to couple the telescope beam to the mixer. The waveguide balanced mixer is based on a <b>magic</b> <b>T</b> with integrated RF and LO feed horns. Losses in the Nb film increase at frequencies above the Nb gap frequency of 690 GHz and limit the mixer sensitivity at the high end of ALMA band 9. In this paper we present a layout concept of the optics and the mixers as well as an analysis of its RF properties which shows that efficient mixer operation is still possible across this band without changing the material of tuning elements...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 42) There {{are numerous}} ways to achieve sum-difference magic tee performance in strip transmission line packages. The tandem-cascade magic tee first suggested by Carpenter is particularly adapted to realization in stripline and is closely examined here. The fundamentals of coupled transmission line theory are briefly reviewed and the scattering parameters for a transmission line coupler are introduced. Coupled striplines are introduced, and methods to achieve <b>magic</b> <b>T</b> performance are discussed. The tandem-cascade magic tee, an interconnection of three simple stripline couplers, {{is shown to}} have advantages due to its simplicity of fabrication. The tandem-cascade magic tee is discussed in detail. New scattering parameters are derived to include {{the effects of the}} transmission lines necessary to interconnect the three couplers which comprise the tee. These previously unpublished scattering parameters are incorporated into a computer program which is used to simulate the response of the tee to various modifications of design. The curved magic tee, a variation on the tandem-cascade design, is shown to have extremely short interconnecting lines. A curved tee was constructed and tested. In an octave bandwidth centered about 1. 0 GHz, the curved tee exhibited equal power split with an error of' ?? 0. 25 db, and sum-difference phase shift with a peak-to-peak phase error of approximately seven degrees...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Tomba (July 2012) for finding (n x n) magic squares (when n is divisible by 4) using basic Latin squares is re-discussed. The steps include fixing the column {{associated with the}} elements, adjacent to the pivot element and arranging in an orderly manner, making symmetric transformations that generates a <b>magic</b> parametric constant (<b>T)</b> and finally derived with minor adjustment on the pair-numbers of satisfying T [12]. Nordgren’s method can be applied {{so as to avoid}} symmetric transformation, adjustment on the pair numbers satisfying T and thereby shortening in 3 steps only. The improved technique for construction of doublyeven magic squares needs three steps with no symmetric transformation, minor adjustments etc. on the pair numbers satisfying T. As such, lot of labour and time is saved with the use of this improved technique.

40|$|In this {{supplementary}} note to [1] we derive {{an explicit}} formula, {{that we call}} the supernormalized formula, {{for the number of}} 3 × 3 supernormalized semimagic squares with specified magic sum s and specified value of a parameter α. This implies, through two more steps, an explicit formula for the number of 3 × 3 semimagic squares with specified <b>magic</b> sum <b>t,</b> i. e., the affine count in [1, Proposition 3. 1]. The supernormalized formula has the form of a single elaborate expression, with floor functions and with separate rules for various cases. It is complicated but the numbers it produces have been (partially) checked against other methods and appear to be correct. We think it is interesting that one can derive any such formula. The same thing should be feasible, though with more difficulty, for affine magilatin enumeration, thereby enabling one to derive the complete quasipolynomial from data as a check on the geometrical Ehrhart method. 3. Semimagic squares of order 3 We quote from [1, Proposition 3. 1] the general form of a reduced, normalized 3 × 3 semimagic square, in which the magic sum is s = 2 α + 2 β + γ: 0 β 2 α + β + γ (3. 1) α + β α + β + γ − δ δ α + β + γ α + δ β − δ Proposition 3. 1.

40|$|Abstract: Tomba (2012) {{introduced}} a technique for construction (n x n) magic squares (when n is odd) using basic Lat in Squares by fixing the pivot element and arranging other elements {{in an orderly}} manner [10]. However, even-order magic squares can’t be constructed using the same procedure because of duplication in diagonal elements. In this paper, a technique for constructing (n x n) magic squares (when n is doubly even) using basic Latin square is developed. Doubly even magic squares are made by fixing the column associated with the elements, adjacent to the pivot element and arranging {{in an orderly manner}} that generates a <b>magic</b> parametric constant (<b>T,</b> known as Tomba’s constant) and sub-magic parametric constants (Ti) and finally derived by minor adjustment on the values of Ti s. The technique can provide weak magic squares for singly even cases. The construction is illustrated with suitable examples.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo detect {{structural}} {{adaptations of}} collagen fiber matrix in compressed articular cartilage in individual sub-tissue zones by microscopic {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (μMRI) at 23 μm in-depth resolution. DesignEach of the six beagle humeral cartilage specimens {{was placed in a}} specially built nonmetallic compression device inside an in-situ rotation device, and was imaged four times at 7 T: without and during static compression, and at two orientations: 0 ° and 55 °. Proton intensity images and quantitative T 2 maps were constructed and analyzed. ResultsUpon compression at 55 ° (the magic angle), rather than appearing homogenous, T 2 -weighted intensity images of cartilage showed a distinct laminar appearance and the T 2 profiles exhibited two distinctive peaks. At both 0 ° and 55 ° orientations, lower values of T 2 were observed in compressed tissue. A significant correlation was established between changes in tissue T 2 at 55 ° and a thickness reduction due to compression. At a mean of 20 % strain value, modifications in cartilage structure were studied at each histological zone. We found that the percentage of superficial zone was significantly doubled, the percentage of radial zone was significantly decreased by 10 %, and no significant change in the transitional zone. ConclusionsExternal loading can induce a new kind of laminar appearance at the <b>magic</b> angle. μMRI <b>T</b> 2 anisotropy can be used to analyze the zone-specific alterations in collagen fibril organization in articular cartilage in response to mechanical compression...|$|R
