The termination of the capacitor bank, designed to minimize the destructive effects of the exploding coils, permitted a repetition rate of one shot per hour. Magnetic bremsstrahlung emitted by the electrons was recorded on X-ray film and nuclear emulsions.

40|$|Motivated by the {{possibility}} of explaining the 3. 5 keV line through dark matter decaying to axion-like particles that subsequently convert to photons, we study ALP-photon conversion for sightlines passing within 50 pc of the galactic centre. Conversion depends on the galactic centre magnetic field which is highly uncertain. For fields at low or mid-range of observational estimates (10 – 100 μG), no observable signal is possible. For fields at the high range of observational estimates (a pervasive poloidal <b>mG</b> <b>field</b> over the central 150 pc) it is possible to generate sufficient signal to explain recent observations of a 3. 5 keV line in the galactic centre. In this scenario, the galactic centre line signal comes predominantly from the region with  z >  20  pc, reconciling the results from the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes. The dark matter to ALP to photon scenario also naturally predicts the non-observation of the 3. 5 keV line in stacked galaxy spectra.

The overall spectral distribution exhibits peaks at 1500 and 1700 angstrom, while the UV light curves display a quasi-sinusoidal modulation over the binary orbit. Models of white dwarfs (WDs) with a hot spot and cyclotron emission were attempted to fit the spectral variations {{throughout the}} orbit. A non-magnetic WD with a temperature of similar to 10, 000 K and a hot spot with a central temperature of 15, 000 K generally match the broad absorptions at 1400 and 1600 angstrom with those expected for the quasi-molecular H features H- 2 and H- 2 (+). However, the flux {{in the core of}} the Ly alpha absorption does not go to zero, implying an additional component, and the flux variations throughout the orbit are not well matched at long wavelengths. Alternatively, a 9500 K WD with a 100 MG cyclotron component can fit the lowest (phase 0. 0) fluxes, but the highest fluxes (phase 0. 5) require an additional source of magnetic field or temperature.

40|$|Ion fast ignition, like laser fast ignition, can {{potentially}} reduce driver energy for high target gain by {{an order of}} magnitude, while reducing fuel capsule implosion velocity, convergence ratio, and required precisions in target fabrication and illumination symmetry, all of which should further improve and simplify IFE power plants. From fast-ignition target requirements, we determine requirements for ion beam acceleration, pulse-compression, and final focus for advanced accelerators that must be developed for much shorter pulses and higher voltage gradients than today's accelerators, to deliver the petawatt peak powers and small focal spots ({approx} 100 {micro}m) required. Although such peak powers and small focal spots are available today with lasers, development of such advanced accelerators is motivated by the greater likely efficiency of deep ion penetration and deposition into pre-compressed 1000 x liquid density DT cores. Ion ignitor beam parameters for acceleration, pulse compression, and final focus are estimated for two examples based on a Dielectric Wall Accelerator; (1) a small target with {rho}r {approx} 2 g/cm{sup 2 } for a small demo/pilot plant producing {approx} 40 MJ of fusion yield per target, and (2) a large target with {rho}r {approx} 10 g/cm{sup 2 } producing {approx} 1 GJ yield for multi-unit electricity/hydrogen plants, allowing internal T-breeding with low T/D ratios, > 75 % of the total fusion yield captured for plasma direct conversion, and simple liquid-protected chambers with gravity clearing.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{radiation}} magnetohydrodynamic simulations {{of the atmosphere}} of white dwarf stars. We demonstrate that convective energy transfer is seriously impeded by magnetic fields when the plasma-beta parameter, the thermal-to-magnetic-pressure ratio, becomes smaller than unity. The critical field strength that inhibits convection in the photosphere of white dwarfs is in the range B = 1 - 50 kG, which is {{much smaller than the}} typical 1 - 1000 <b>MG</b> <b>field</b> strengths observed in magnetic white dwarfs, implying that these objects have radiative atmospheres. We have employed evolutionary models to study the cooling process of high-field magnetic white dwarfs, where convection is entirely suppressed during the full evolution (B greater than or similar to 10 MG). We find that the inhibition of convection has no effect on cooling rates until the effective temperature (T-eff) reaches a value of around 5500 K. In this regime, the standard convective sequences start to deviate from the ones without convection due to the convective coupling between the outer layers and the degenerate reservoir of thermal energy. Since no magnetic white dwarfs are currently known at the low temperatures where this coupling significantly changes the evolution, the effects of magnetism on cooling rates are not expected to be observed. This result contrasts with a recent suggestion that magnetic white dwarfs with Teff less than or similar to 10, 000 K cool significantly slower than non-magnetic degenerates...|$|E

40|$|Alpha-chlorohydrin (EPIBLOC) {{introduces}} {{a new form}} of rodenticide - the toxicant-sterilant. EPIBLOC, as a pest control product registered and used in some countries, changes the concept of chemosterilants from theoretical to practical. The active ingredient also acts as an acute toxicant in the control of rodents. It is effective on both sexes and all age groups. Alpha-chlorohydrin is rapidly absorbed and metabolized; therefore, it is neither a secondary toxicant nor a cumulative toxicant. Another unique biological characteristic of this compound is its species specificity with regards to male sterility. First, only sexually mature males are rendered sterile through the development of lesions in the epididymis, and second, male sterility is restricted to rodent species. Adult males of some mammalian species become temporarily infertile when treated with nonlethal doses of alphachlorohydrin. These males regain their fertility shortly after the end of treatment. Males from seven rodent species are known to develop permanent sterility. Of all the species tested Rattus norvegicus has been subjected to the most research. The single oral dose which produces temporary infertility in this species is 15 - 20 mg/kg of body weight; the dose that produces permanent sterility is 90 - 100 mg; and the LD 50 is 150 - 160 <b>mg.</b> <b>Field</b> tests with EPIBLOC on a variety of rodent pests have provided a body of practical information.

A diagnose pelo DRIS indicou a seguinte ordem de limitação por deficiência: K > Ca > B, no coqueiral da fazenda Capivari. As classes de menor produtividade apresentaram índices DRIS de K e de B mais negativos que a classe de maior produtividade, havendo, também, um aparente desequilíbrio nutricional entre Ca e <b>Mg.</b> <b>Field</b> {{trials were}} conducted {{with the aim of}} establishing DRIS norms for green dwarf coconut in the North of the state of Rio de Janeiro as an alternative for the nutritional diagnosis of plants. Trials were conducted in the districts of São João da Barra, at São João farm and Quissamã, at Capivari farm, from March, 2000 to December, 2001. A high yielding crop at the São João farm, whose mean yield was 227 ± 16 fruits plant- 1 year- 1, had leaves samples taken at 132 days intervals during a two year period to establish DRIS norms. Lower yielding plants at the Capivari farm were nutritionally diagnosed by means of the generated DRIS norms. The plants to be diagnosed were divided into four yielding categories, 200 fruits plant- 1 year- 1. The diagnosis by means of DRIS indicated the following limitation order of deficiency: K> Ca> B, in the coconut culture at the Capivari farm. The classes of smaller productivity presented K and B DRIS indices more negative than the class of larger productivity. An apparent nutritional unbalance between Ca and Mg was indicated...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma {{control in}} any poultry company {{requires}} an integrated approach involving diligent biosecurity, animal husbandry and disease surveillance. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection is very costly to the broiler industry as it predisposes birds {{to a variety}} of primary and secondary respiratory diseases thus reducing production efficiency and profitability. Since the primary disease is rather insidious, relatively difficult to confirm (especially in vaccinated flocks), prone to becoming quiescent and vertically transmitted, control measures must begin at the breeder level and involve conscientious flock surveillance. While disease eradication is the best approach to MG control the economic pressures of modern broiler production often preclude such drastic measures. Vaccination programmes are often introduced to reduce the economic impact of the disease in breeder flocks and to minimize, or hopefully prevent vertical transmission. To prevent vertical transmission and lateral spread of field strain MG infection, early diagnosis is critical. Flock testing needs to be done every 2 - 4 weeks (depending on prevailing risk), on 90 birds (for an average flock of 7 000 birds) to satisfy statistical requirements for the detection of a 5 % infection-rate with 99 % confidence. The RSPA test provides an inexpensive, reliable and rapid means of evaluating the serological response to ts- 11 strain vaccination during the rearing phase. A floor pen trial confirmed that, three to ten weeks after ts- 11 vaccination at 10 weeks of age, the RSPA test reactor rate is between 30 % and 60 %. PCR was used to confirm the absence of field challenge. A retrospective analysis of 4 years of RSPA test data from broiler breeder flocks immunized with the live ts- 11 strain MG vaccine indicated that traditional RSPA test monitoring protocols were unreliable as a means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccination from field strain MG infection. Non-infected (PCR negative) vaccinated flocks reached sero-positive agglutination rates of 100 % making the differentiation of vaccine response and field infection impossible during the lay cycle. RSPA monitoring of broiler breeders during the pullet rearing stage (0 - 20 weeks) was in contrast still very effective. While previously reported trials indicated that the introduction and subsequent serological monitoring of in-contact non-vaccinated sentinels may enhance the efficacy of the RSPA monitoring procedure this trial indicated that it does not. The ts- 11 strain MG spread to in-contact sentinels so rapidly under field conditions that the serum agglutination pattern of these birds mimics that of the vaccinated pullets. The potential for ts- 11 strain MG to spread from bird to bird is a reality and even spread from pen to pen (within the same house) may be possible if biosecurity is inadequate. The decision to vaccinate should include consideration as to the consequence of ts- 11 strain MG spread to surrounding susceptible flocks. The use of molecular diagnostic techniques on pooled tracheal swabs taken from representative flock birds is a potentially cost effective and reliable means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccine strain from field strain MG. PCR amplification of DNA from tracheal swab samples and strain identification based on amplicon size was shown to be a reliable and sensitive means of detecting ts- 11 strain following vaccination. The proprietary PCR primer used in this trial was specifically designed to identify the ts- 11 strain by amplifying a 229 bp fragment that is characteristic and distinguishable from all other <b>MG</b> <b>field</b> strain isolates based on amplicon size. This technique provides the opportunity to differentiate field strain infection from vaccine strain MG, provided strain specific PCR primers are available. It is recommended that the RSPA assay is used to differentiate effective vaccination from field exposure during pullet rearing and PCR assay is used to monitor broiler breeder flocks for MG challenge during the laying cycle and confirm that point-of-lay broiler breeder pullets are free of field strain MG infection. Where possible flocks with a confirmed field strain challenge should be eliminated and all hatching eggs removed from the hatchery and destroyed. Dissertation (MMedVet (Altil.))
