60|$|For {{a moment}} I listened, then {{tightened}} <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on my crowbar, {{and led the}} way up the gallery.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too much!" [...] he groaned, almost screamed. [...] "I'm losing <b>my</b> <b>grip.</b> I've got to go. You can't save me. Keep {{away and}} save yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|And all {{the time}} I dared not look toward the land lest my heart should fail me. I {{released}} <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> at last and he ran forward as if fleeing for dear life.|$|E
6000|$|... "My hounds may a' rin masterless, My hawks may fly frae tree to tree; <b>My</b> lord may <b>grip</b> <b>my</b> vassal lands, For {{there again}} maun I never be." ...|$|R
50|$|When Benny {{and cast}} were {{preparing}} to board the train, Anderson and Benny had their first lines together, with the following exchange: Benny: “Hey redcap, carry <b>my</b> <b>grips</b> a little higher; {{there are some things}} hanging out.”Anderson: “Yes, sir.”Benny: “Just drop the grips down here until I get my crowd together.”Anderson: “Yes, Mr. Bunny.”Benny: “The name’s Benny.”Anderson: “Well, this is Easter.”There was a recurring gag wherein Benny's inquiries about their arrival in Albuquerque were met with skepticism by Anderson that such a place existed.|$|R
60|$|O les laches que les hommes! I was so frightened, that I scarce saw anything, but vaguely {{felt that}} Lady Castlewood's dark eyes were {{following}} me. <b>My</b> lord <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> {{arm in the}} corridor, we quickened our paces till our retreat became a disgraceful run. We did not breathe freely till {{we were in the}} open air in the courtyard, where the keepers and the dogs were waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{dear friends}} and that clear {{atmosphere}} seemed very sweet to me, very fine but remote. <b>My</b> <b>grip</b> was fixing now upon the world. I saw another door opening--the {{door of my}} career." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bill grinned comprehendingly. [...] "I'll tell Tom, {{but nobody}} else. We {{have our own}} little row with the vermin, {{and the next time}} I get <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on him there'll be an end of him!" ...|$|E
60|$|The possibility, {{indeed the}} probability, of Sam seeking out Buck and forming an {{alliance}} {{had occurred to}} me, and I was prepared for it. I shifted <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on the automatic pistol in my hand.|$|E
6000|$|Click! {{the king}} and I were handcuffed together! Our companions, those servants, had done it; <b>my</b> lord <b>Grip</b> stood looking on. The king burst out in a fury, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|She hid {{her tears}} from me. Something <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> heart at the thought.|$|R

60|$|Even {{during my}} sudden flight {{through the air}} I had not once {{released}} <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> upon my long-sword, and now I ran beneath the two battling monsters, jabbing the winged terror repeatedly with its sharp point.|$|E
60|$|But Buell said {{it would}} be better for him to go with me, though he did not explain. He kept with me, still he {{remained}} in the office while I went up-stairs. Somehow this suited me, for I did not want him to see the broken window. I took a few things from <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> and rolled them in a bundle. Then I took a little leather case of odds and ends I had always carried when camping and slipped it into my pocket. Hurrying down-stairs I left <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> with the porter, wrote and mailed a postal card to my father, and followed the impatient Buell.|$|E
6000|$|She made no answer, but {{hugged her}} tattered blanket round her, and {{shifting}} <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> from her arm, I seized it and rent it, showing her breast and shoulder; then I let her go, laughing, and said:-- ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had just}} put the last slice on when Bill sat up suddenly, and <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned over}} to me, and <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> hand where it lay on the {{saddle-bow}} clutching the reins.|$|R
60|$|I {{was shorter}} and I suppose {{a couple of}} years younger than he, but I had the improvised club in <b>my</b> pocket <b>gripped</b> ready, and I would have fought with him very cheerfully. But he fell a step {{backward}} as I came toward him.|$|R
6000|$|I {{gave the}} grasp of {{partnership}} [...] To one of other race-- A plane: he barked him strip by strip [...] From upper bough to base; And me therewith; for gone <b>my</b> <b>grip,</b> [...] My arms could not enlace.|$|E
60|$|Ah, {{it was so}} fine to have a horse {{between my}} thighs and a weapon in <b>my</b> <b>grip.</b> I waved it above my head and shouted in my exultation. The chief had come forward with that odious smiling face of his.|$|E
60|$|As I {{extended}} my hand {{to search}} for the controlling button, that cruel and mocking laugh rang out once more, so close to me this time that I involuntarily shrank back, tightening <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> upon the hilt of my great sword.|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} we all turned with one accord towards the cabin. I felt Farrar <b>gripping</b> <b>my</b> arm tightly from behind.|$|R
60|$|Then {{something}} {{seemed to}} <b>grip</b> <b>my</b> throat and I knew that I had died--for the world floated away from beneath me.|$|R
60|$|But I did not {{pause to}} think. In a moment I {{was across the}} garden, <b>my</b> hands <b>gripped</b> {{the top of the}} wooden fence, I hoisted myself up--with some difficulty, I confess--but at last I succeeded. I threw my leg over and gently dropped down on the other side.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] said Keller. [...] "All the same, I can't keep <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on the {{business}} long and want a man to help. But I'm not going to trust a stranger or a hired man. You see where this leads?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When Falkner {{returned}} he said hurriedly to his companion, [...] "Do {{you think}} it wise, George, to let those hell-hounds loose? Good God! I could scarcely let <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> of his throat go, when I thought {{of what they were}} hunting." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{a slight}} shudder under {{my hand and}} {{released}} <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> as if frightened by that sign of animation in her body. The scented air of the garden came to us in a warm wave like a voluptuous and perfumed sigh.|$|E
60|$|We {{were silent}} for several minutes. Suddenly <b>my</b> fingers <b>gripped</b> Louis' arm. Had I been blind {{all this time}} that they had escaped my notice? Then I {{saw that they were}} sitting at an extra table which had been hastily arranged, and I knew that they could have only just arrived.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated, {{awkward and}} bashful, {{shifted his weight}} from one leg to the other, then blunderingly <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> hand in a hearty shake.|$|R
6000|$|Or. [...] Who, who <b>grips</b> <b>my</b> arm! Who holds me back? O Madness! Ah Aegisthus! I see him; they {{drag him}} hither--Off with thee! ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{took the}} jay {{carefully}} from the trap he played possum, lying limp {{in my hand}} till <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> relaxed, when he flew to a branch over my head, squalling and upbraiding me for having {{anything to do with}} such abominable inventions.|$|E
6000|$|She {{found her}} father dressed. He {{did not know}} whether or not he wanted to go on. [...] "I seem to have lost <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on things. I used to be rather decisive. But we'll try it one more day, if you like," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{apparently}} no help for it, and I {{was not quite}} certain he would shoot, so balancing the long fork, lance fashion, I tightened <b>my</b> <b>grip</b> on the bridle, when Gordon drove his horse against me and gripped it violently. [...] "Hold on; the boys are coming!" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Though, indeed,' added Barnaby, laying {{his hand}} upon {{the neck of}} Lord George's horse, and {{speaking}} softly: 'you {{had good reason to}} ask me what he is, for sometimes it puzzles me--and I am used to him--to think he's only a bird. He's <b>my</b> brother, <b>Grip</b> is--always with me--always talking--always merry--eh, Grip?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Cantankerous Old Lady <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> arm hard. 'What {{an unusually}} {{intelligent}} girl!' she broke in. 'How {{on earth did}} you guess? It is Georgina.' ...|$|R
60|$|The child moved {{suddenly}} towards me. Her thin, shabbily gloved fingers <b>gripped</b> <b>my</b> {{arm with}} almost painful force. Her eyes {{were full of}} passionate appeal.|$|R
