30|$|Therefore, {{the higher}} shift in {{magnitude}} of compressive stress for the as-grown ultrathin than thin ZnO NW arrays and UHV annealed at 873  K {{indicates that the}} 15 -nm ZnO NW arrays are at higher compressive stress than the 100  nm. Micro-Raman results show the increase in E 2 (high) peak intensity, and the decrease in FWHM represents the increase in crystallite size and an improvement in the crystalline quality of NW arrays after the annealing treatment. These results demonstrate that 15 -nm ZnO NW have lower lasing power threshold than 100 -nm NW due to the higher crystallinity of the ultrathin ZnO NW arrays. The positive voltage for hot probe measurements {{points out that the}} grown ZnO NWs are n-type, and the higher values of voltage and vacancies for 15  nm as compared to those of the 100 -nm NWs indicate the higher number of majority charge carries for ultrathin NW arrays than that for thin. Therefore, by tuning the oxygen vacancies occupancy, one can control the electrical properties of the nano device, especially the threshold voltage of ZnO-based field effect transistors (FinFETs and MOSFETs). The VSM results reveal that the as-grown 15 -nm NWs have the higher magnetization approximately of the order of 4 as compared to the 100 -nm ZnO NW array. In fact, there is a shift in magnetization and a propensity of saturation of magnetization for 15 -nm ZnO NW arrays by factor 2 and at approximately 5, 000  Oe even after UHV annealing at 873  K. In contrast, a much larger change of 2 orders and a tendency of saturation of magnetization occur at approximately 10, 000  Oe for 100 -nm NW arrays. These studies will pave way for the use of high-aspect-ratio 15 -nm ZnO NWs as nanoscale spin-based devices, such as spin valves and spin FETs and 100 -nm ZnO NWs for deep UV <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>device</b> application.|$|E

30|$|However, Figure  18 {{shows the}} {{hysteretic}} behavior and non-saturation of the magnetization for thin NW arrays {{even after the}} UHV treatment. Further, there is a steady decrease of magnetization in 15 -nm {{as well as in}} 100 -nm ZnO NW arrays with the UHV annealing treatment at different temperatures as shown in the Figure  17 curves b, c, and d and Figure  18 curves b, c, and d. In contrast, the saturation of magnetization for ultrathin NWs occurs at relatively lower fields, approximately 5, 000  Oe. These results indicate a relatively small factor of 2 shifts in the magnetization of ultrathin (15  nm) ZnO NW arrays even after UHV annealing. In contrast, a much larger change of 2 orders is observed for thin (100  nm) NW arrays. In fact, the as-grown ultrathin NWs have higher magnetization, approximately of the order of 4 as compared to the thin ZnO NW array, though the observed magnetism in well-aligned ZnO NW arrays is unexpected, because neither Zn 2 + nor O 2 − is magnetic. Thus, there is no apparent source for magnetism in undoped ZnO [62]. As no magnetic impurities were present, it appears that the origin of ultrathin and thin NW array ferromagnetism may be the exchange interactions between localized electron spin moments resulting from oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of the ZnO NWs. Furthermore, the observed magnetization in the ZnO NW array may be probably due to the defects. We presumed that those defects are located close to each other and mostly are at the NW surfaces (skin effect), and after UHV treatment, reduction in magnetism indicates the {{decrease in the number of}} density defects as those in ultrathin films [63]. It supports our previous observation of XRD and Raman analyses.

30|$|Further, the tunable {{ferromagnetic}} {{properties of}} ZnO show {{great potential for}} the use in spintronic and magneto-optic-based devices. As the dimensions of ZnO nanostructures are {{comparable to that of}} its exciton Bohr radius (approximately 2.4  nm), interesting optical emissions have been observed due to the band gap engineering from 2.5 to 6  eV by alloying. Xu et al. [40] investigated magnetic properties of ZnO nanostructured film of approximately 15 -nm grain size deposited by a sol-gel technique at room temperature. However, the microscopic origin of this ferromagnetic transition is poorly understood. Moreover, the variation in crystallite size poses the serious consequences on mobility of nanostructures [41, 42].

However, it is unfortunate that although most of the Zn/Mn bulk and nanostructure materials exhibit RTFM, strong UV photoluminescence [PL] is hardly achieved. This {{may be due to the}} difficulty in controlling the interaction between the Mn dopant and intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies during the fabrication process [22 – 26]. So far, its luminescence mechanism has still been in discussion [22 – 26]. With the aim of providing further understanding of the optical nature of Mn-doped ZnO HMSs, UV-visible [vis] and PL spectra are used to study their optical characteristics, and the corresponding mechanism has been discussed. Also, the surface morphology of the products was investigated by scanning/transmission electron microscopy [SEM/TEM] or by high-resolution TEM [HRTEM].

This is made more urgent by the large and growing optical-electronic bandwidth mismatch {{as well as the}} rapid approach of device dimensions to the quantum limit. Fiber-based switches utilizing bismuth-substituted iron garnets as Faraday rotators in Mach-Zehnder and Sagnac interferometer configurations are proposed, analyzed and characterized. The issues and limitations of these switches are investigated and efforts are undertaken to model and optimize the field generating coil impedance parameters. While alleviating the concerns associated with free-space switches and being compatible with contemporary optical networks, the performance of the fiber-based interferometric switches is still below theoretical limits and could be improved. Moreover, the discrete components of a fiber-based implementation engender scalability concerns. In keeping with the spirit of Richard Feynman 2 ̆ 7 s lectures, the maturity of planar lithographic techniques that are widely used in microelectronics is leveraged to realize integrated versions of the fiber-based interferometric switches.

While the larger waveguide cross-section of the microphotonic switches enables efficient coupling to fiber and greatly reduces geometrical birefringence, the weak confinement results in longer device lengths.

The glass density is found increase and molar volume decrease {{with the increase of}} NPs concentration. The TEM micrographs reveal the presence of spherical NPs of average diameter ~ 26 nm with homogenous distribution. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra exhibit ten absorption bands centered at 376, 406, 448, 486, 522, 546, 652, 798, 976 and 1534 nm corresponding to the absorption from 4 I 15 / 2 ground state to various excited states of Er 3 + ions. The optical band gap energy for direct (4. 47 - 3. 64 eV) and indirect (4. 27 - 3. 53 eV) transitions and Urbach energy (0. 65 - 0. 15 eV) are found to decrease with the increase of Fe 3 O 4 contents. The decrease in band gap energy is ascribed to the creation of non bridging oxygen (NBO) ions in the glass network.

A study of the effect of compositional variation on structural, optical and magnetic properties of magneto optic garnet films was carried out and it demonstrated the feasibility of the multi-PLD approach, which was shown to be capable to grow complex crystalline oxide materials, such as YIG and yttrium ferrite (YFeO 3), from ablation of their precursor targets (Y 2 O 3 or Fe 2 O 3) with different ablation rates and deposition of material on different substrates and, in particular, yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG or Y 3 Al 5 O 12) and sapphire (Al 2 O 3). Some YIG films were also used to demonstrate Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) of crystalline materials and the applicability of PLD-grown YIG films in novel meta-material microwave devices...|$|R
