40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the estimation of structural VARs with sign restrictions. It is shown how sign restrictions solve the parametric identification problem present in structural systems but leave the model identification problem unresolved. A market and a macro model are used to illustrate these points. Suggestions have been made on how to find a unique model. These are reviewed, along with some of the difficulties that can arise in how one is to use the impulse responses found with sign restrictions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} sign {{languages}} attempts {{to create a}} coherent model that binds the expressive nature of signs conveyed in gestures to a linguistic framework. Gesture modelling offers an alternative that provides device independence, scalability and flexibility for the annotation and modelling of linguistic phenomena. This paper presents the requirements and initial experiments to build an input method editor for sign languages. The objective is to design interfaces backed up by computational methods that can infer and use linguistic guidance to <b>model</b> <b>sign</b> language gestures. This in turn produces a linguistically annotated corpus of gesture animations. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} panel {{vector autoregressive model}} for the member {{countries}} of the Euro Area to explore the role of banks during the slump of the real economy that followed the financial crisis. In particular, we seek to quantify the macroeconomic effects of adverse loan supply shocks, which are identified using sign restrictions. We find that loan supply shocks significantly contributed {{to the evolution of}} the loan volume and real GDP growth in all member countries during the financial crisis. However, concerning both, the timing and the magnitude of the shocks our results also indicate that the Euro Area was characterized by a considerable degree of cross–country heterogeneity.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} how we would express non-manual markers in NVSG element <b>model.</b> <b>Sign</b> {{language}} is a visual language for {{which there are no}} general methods of providing descriptions in text. That is why we are proposing a new NVSG element model that focuses on the linguistic structure of sign language. The NVSG element model defines four elements that describe sign language. Manual movements are expressed as N and V elements, and non-manual markers as S and G elements. We have mostly finalized the descriptive parameters for the N and V elements. Up until this point, we have described approximately 1, 500 words using the NVSG element model. As a result of this process, we have achieved a greater visual understanding of the hierarchical structures of morphological elements per word. Such descriptions of non-manual markers also enable us to write sentences...|$|E
40|$|Background. Staff may {{encourage}} individuals with intellectual disabilities to use manual signs by modeling its use, but implementing KWS during daily {{activities can be}} demanding. Method. Staff’s use of manual signs was observed in 4 special schools and 4 day centers for adults with intellectual disabilities during communicative group activities, non-communicative group activities, and mealtimes. Using in-situ partial interval coding, we measured staff’s communication rate, semantic diversity of manual signs, sign reinforcement, and sign imitation. With Chi Squared tests, associations were measured between these variables, the two settings, and the three activity types. Results. During communicative activities, staff used manual signs significantly more in adult services than special schools. During non-communicative activities and mealtimes, staff seldom used or reinforced signs. Conclusions. Staff communicated frequently but did not often <b>model</b> <b>sign</b> use during daily activities.

40|$|We use {{a dynamic}} factor model {{to provide a}} semi-structural {{representation}} for 101 quarterly US macroeconomic series. We find that (i) the US economy is well described {{by a number of}} structural shocks between two and six. Focusing on the four-shock specification, we identify, using sign re- strictions, two non-policy shocks, demand and supply, and two policy shocks, monetary and fiscal. We obtain the following results. (ii) Both supply and demand shocks are important sources of fluc- tuations; supply prevails for GDP, while demand prevails for employment and inflation. (ii) Policy matters, Both monetary and fiscal policy shocks have sizeable effects on output and prices, with little evidence of crowding out; both monetary and fiscal authorities implement important system- atic countercyclical policies reacting to demand shocks. (iii) Negative demand shocks have a large long-run positive effect on productivity, consistently with the Schumpeterian "cleansing" view of recessions. structural factor <b>model,</b> <b>sign</b> restrictions, monetary policy, fiscal policy, demand, supply...|$|E

40|$|Hand gesture {{segmentation}} is {{a difficult}} problem that must be overcome if gestural interfaces are to be practical. This paper sets out a recognition-led approach {{that focuses on the}} actual recognition techniques required for gestural interaction. Within this approach, a holistic view of the gesture input data stream is taken that considers what links the low-level and high-level features of gestural communication. Using this view, a theory is proposed that a state of high hand tension {{can be used as a}} gesture segmentation cue for certain classes of gestures. A model of hand tension is developed and then applied successfully to segment two British Sign Language sentence fragments.

It begins with an analysis of sign models and the way they can take into account the sign variability. Then, we review the most popular technics dedicated to automatic sign language processing and we focus on their adaptation to <b>model</b> <b>sign</b> variability. We present a new method to provide a parametric description of the sign as a set of continuous and discrete parameters. Signs are classified according to there categories (ballistic movements, circles [...] .), the symmetry between the hand movements, hand absolute and relative locations. Membership grades to sign categories and continuous parameter comparisons can be combined to estimate the similarity between two signs. We set out our system and we evaluate how much time can be saved when looking for a sign in a french sign language video. By now, our formalism only uses hand 2 D locations, we finally discuss about the way of integrating other parameters as hand shape or facial expression in our framework. 1...|$|E

On one side, [Lidell 90] broke down signs into hold and movement phases (muli-segmental model). This sign representation gives rise to sign temporal organization and parameter synchronization. It models any gesture, even if it is incompatible with SL phonology. On the other side, [Channon 02] proposed a mono-segmental sign model where a sign can be depicted as a set of features like the repetition, the dominant/non dominant hand relationship, th...|$|E
