40|$|<b>Methylotrophs</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{microorganisms}} that use compounds without a carbon–carbon bond as a sole source of carbon and energy for growth. <b>Methylotrophs</b> {{play an important role in}} most environments, including terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats. Several approaches to detect and identify <b>methylotrophs</b> in environmental samples have been developed. A common approach is to target protein-encoding genes since <b>methylotrophs</b> are phylogenetically diverse, making the design of 16 S rRNA primers and probes with wide coverage difficult or impossible. The mxaF gene encoding the active subunit of the methanol dehydrogenase is one of the more universal targets for <b>methylotrophs,</b> as are some of the genes involved in C 1 -transfer reactions, such as fhcD gene of methanopterin-linked pathway. The pmoA gene, encoding the beta-subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase, is a common target for methanotrophs. In many cases the evolution of these functional genes is congruent with the 16 S rRNA and other phylogenetic markers, making them suitable for inferring taxonomy.

Understanding methanol degraders such as <b>methylotrophs</b> can help better our understanding of Earth’s systems to help us combat and understand climate change as well as soil ecosystem health. This study creates a basis for future examinations of the physiological attributes of specific methylotrophs; studies that would further our understanding of the <b>methylotroph’s</b> role in methanol exchange. We grew methylotrophic bacteria by plating a dilution of the soil onto methylotrophic specific media. The colonies on the plates were counted and sequenced for identification.

The generalizations relating P/O ratios and cell yields, which have been used previously for such calculations, are not always applicable to methylo-trophs. In particular, for the majority of <b>methylotrophs</b> the growth yield is determined by NAD(P) H supply as well as ATP supply, and for some <b>methylotrophs</b> growth yields may be exclusively NAD(P) H-limited.

40|$|Oligodeoxynucleotide {{sequences}} that uniquely complemented 16 S rRNAs of {{each group}} of <b>methylotrophs</b> were synthesized and used as hybridization probes for the identification of methylotrophic bacteria possessing the serine and ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathways for formaldehyde fixation. The specificity of the probes was determined by hybridizing radiolabeled probes with slot-blotted RNAs of <b>methylotrophs</b> and other eubacteria followed by autoradiography. The washing temperature was determined experimentally to be 50 and 52 degrees C for 9 -alpha (serine pathway) and 10 -gamma (RuMP pathway) probes, respectively. RNAs isolated from serine pathway <b>methylotrophs</b> bound to probe 9 -alpha, and RNAs from RuMP pathway <b>methylotrophs</b> bound to probe 10 -gamma. Nonmethylotrophic eubacterial RNAs did not bind to either probe. The probes were also labeled with fluorescent dyes. Cells fixed to microscope slides were hybridized with these probes, washed, and examined in a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets. Cells of methylotrophic bacteria possessing the serine or RuMP pathway specifically bind probes designed for each group.

5000|$|<b>Methylotrophs</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{microorganisms}} that can use reduced one-carbon compounds, such as methanol or methane, as the carbon source for their growth; and multi-carbon compounds that contain no carbon bonds, such as dimethyl ether and dimethylamine. This group of microorganisms also includes those capable of assimilating reduced one-carbon compounds by way of carbon dioxide using the ribulose bisphosphate pathway. [...] These organisms {{should not be confused with}} methanogens which on the contrary produce methane as a by-product from various one-carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide.Some <b>methylotrophs</b> can degrade the greenhouse gas methane, and in this case they are called methanotrophs. The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus is used to degrade methane and other pollutants. The abundance, purity, and low price of methanol compared to commonly used sugars make <b>methylotrophs</b> competent organisms for production of amino acids, vitamins, recombinant proteins, single-cell proteins, co-enzymes and cytochromes.|$|R
50|$|One such {{important}} <b>methylotroph</b> {{of interest}} is Methylobacillus flagellatus KT strain. Methylobacillus flagellatus was first isolated in the early 1980s in sewerage pipes of a metropolitan sanitary sewer. “M. flagellatus is most closely related to {{other members of the}} family Methylophilaceae.” The shape of M. flagellatus is an oval shape, with multiple flagella originating from opposite poles of the bacteria. Using small-subunit 16S rRNAs and comparing metabolic/phylogenic similarities and differences< between M. flagellatus and its relatives, scientists have determined that Methylobacillus flagellatus (betaproteobacteria) is more closely related to Methylobacterium extorquens (alphaproteobacteria) and Methylococcus capsulatus (gammaproteobacteria), than to Methylibium petroleiphilum (betaproteobacteria).|$|E
50|$|Specific {{characteristics}} of M. flagellatus {{such as its}} high coefficient of conversion of oxidizers (methanol) to its own biomass allows for practical applications such as inexpensive industrial productions of commercially needed compounds. These compounds can range from heterologous proteins and amino-acids to vitamins. Some methylotrophs within the genus of Methylobacillus can even use organic compounds such as the pesticide carbofuran and choline as carbon raw materials; they use these carbon sources to fulfill their energy and carbon requirements. As early as the late 1980s researchers had known that some methylotrophs possess enzymes such as dichloromethane dehalogenase, or methane monooxygenase (MMO), which degrade various environmental pollutants (i.e.: alkanes, alkenes, and mono- and poly-substituted aromatic compounds). Another common environmental pollutant that results from industrial processes is formaldehyde. Recently, a company called BIP Ltd has been cultivating a pink-pigmented <b>methylotroph,</b> strain BIP, for the specific purpose of remediating formaldehyde-contaminated industrial wastes.|$|E

Extracts had relatively low levels of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was not detected. Comparisons were made with a facultative <b>methylotroph</b> isolated from the same enrichment cultures. The new obligate <b>methylotroph</b> contained hexose phosphate synthetase, a key enzyme in the ribose phosphate cycle of methyl metabolism...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifteen cultures, {{including}} obligate, restricted facultative and facultative <b>methylotrophs</b> {{and members of}} possibly related taxa, were tested for 135 characters based on morphology, physiology and biochemistry {{and the results were}} subjected to computer analysis. The polar lipid composition of all the strains was examined. The isoprenoid quinone composition and the mol % G + C value of the DNA were determined for all the obligate and restricted facultative bacteria, and also for some of the other strains representative of the clusters formed in the numerical taxonomic study. The results indicate that the obligate methanol-utilizing bacteria all exhibit a high phenotypic similarity and are taxonomically distinct from the restricted facultative and the facultative methanol-utilizing bacteria examined and from the pseudomonad reference strains. The results also indicate that the obligate <b>methylotrophs</b> and the restricted facultative <b>methylotrophs</b> represent two distinct taxa of generic status: Methylobacillus and a taxon which can be equated with the organisms currently referred to as ‘Methylophilus’...|$|R
50|$|Methylobacillus is a {{group of}} methylotrophic aerobic bacteria, and they can be found in large numbers in marine and fresh water ecosystems. These organisms are one of Earth’s most {{important}} carbon recyclers, and they recycle such important carbon compounds as methane, methanol, and methylated amines on Earth. “In general <b>methylotrophs</b> can use green-house gases such as carbon dioxide and methane as substrates to fulfill their energy and carbon needs.” Furthermore, strong scientific evidences indicate that a subset group of <b>methylotrophs,</b> the methanotrophs, play huge roles in global warming and groundwater contamination. According to Bonnie et al., methane gas is far more efficient at absorbing infrared radiation than carbon dioxide gas, and “the concentration of methane has been increasing at an alarming rate of 1% per year for the last 150 year to 200 years.” The role that these <b>methylotrophs</b> play in carbon cycling may help us understand, and eventually combat global warming. Thus, it is imperative for researchers to classify, and study methylotrophic bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Movile Cave is an unusual, {{isolated}} ecosystem which harbours {{a complex}} population of microorganisms, fungi and endemic invertebrates. In {{the absence of}} light and with no fixed carbon entering the cave, life is sustained by non-phototrophic microorganisms such as sulfur and methane oxidisers. Also present are <b>methylotrophs</b> that use one-carbon compounds such as methanol and methylated amines as their sole source of carbon and energy. Produced during putrefaction, methylated amines {{are likely to be}} major degradation products in Movile Cave. Further to being methylotrophic substrates, they are also a nitrogen source for many non-methylotrophic bacteria. The role of methylated amines as carbon and nitrogen sources for Movile Cave bacteria was investigated using a combination of DNA stable isotope probing and cultivation studies. Both, well-characterised and novel <b>methylotrophs</b> were identified: Methylotenera mobilis dominated 13 C-monomethylamine SIP enrichments, while members of Catellibacterium, Cupriavidus and Altererythrobacter were also active. Cultivation studies consolidated SIP results in obtaining the first methylotrophic isolates from the genera Catellibacterium and Mesorhizobium. Pathways for monomethylamine (MMA) metabolism were investigated using new PCR primers designed to target gmaS, the gene for gammaglutamylmethylamide synthetase, a key enzyme of the recently characterised indirect MMA oxidation pathway. This pathway is also present in bacteria that use MMA only as a nitrogen source, while the well-characterised, direct MMA oxidation pathway involving methylamine dehydrogenase (mauA) is found only in <b>methylotrophs.</b> gmaS was present in all MMAutilising isolates, while mauA was found only in some <b>methylotrophs,</b> suggesting the indirect pathway is the major mode of MMA oxidation both in <b>methylotrophs</b> and non-methylotrophs from Movile Cave. Preliminary gmaS surveys revealed a high diversity of gmaS-containing bacteria. The roles of N 2 fixers and nitrifiers were also investigated.

Methanol can be inexpensively manufactured from natural gas (which is abundant in the deep sea of our planet) and can also be renewably obtained through reduction of carbon dioxide (Räuchle et al. 2016). Meanwhile, methanol possesses a higher degree of reduction than traditional sugars do (Whitaker et al. 2015). Although efforts have been focused on engineering native or synthetic <b>methylotrophs</b> to convert methanol for the production of biochemical metabolites, the effects are still at the rudimentary level owing to the limited genetic tools for native <b>methylotrophs</b> and the weak methanol consumption abilities of the artificial modified <b>methylotrophs</b> (Whitaker et al. 2015; Price et al. 2016).

It has been researched for years, and a variety of genetic tools and expression vectors has been commercialized (Cregg et al. 2000).
