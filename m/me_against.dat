5|$|<b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, {{released}} while Shakur was imprisoned, made {{an immediate}} {{impact on the}} charts, debuting at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200. This made Shakur the first artist to have an album debut at number one on Billboard 200 while serving time in prison. The album served as one of Shakur's most positively reviewed albums, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest and most influential hip hop albums of all-time. <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E
25|$|Aquino had {{her share}} of box office bombs. Her 2003 movie with actor Robin Padilla, You and <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, was an {{outright}} box office flop. Made for P25,000,000 and released immediately after Aquino won acting awards for her performance in 2002's Mano Po, You and <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World made only P4,389,005. The film's producers lost an estimated P23,000,000, even accounting for home videos. Because You and <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World failed to attract an audience, several movie theaters pulled the film {{and replaced it with}} another film. Some theaters reportedly did this on the movie's second day of play.|$|E

25|$|On February 13, 1996, Shakur {{released}} his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me. This double album {{was the first}} and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums Still I Rise, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz, Loyal to the Game and Pac's Life. He also began the process of recording an album, One Nation, with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.|$|E
500|$|<b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop artist 2Pac. It was {{released}} March 14, 1995 on the Interscope Records label. Drawing lyrical inspiration from his impending prison sentence, troubles with the police, and poverty, the record is described as 2Pac's most introspective album. Steve Huey of AllMusic noted that with <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, the rapper became markedly more [...] "confessional", [...] "reflective", and [...] "soul-baring".|$|E

500|$|Some {{saw him as}} [...] "a {{ruthless}} and manipulative empire builder who brooked no opposition". Brigadier-General James M. Gavin, {{the assistant}} division commander (ADC) of the 82nd Airborne Division, recalled that when he travelled to England in November 1943, the 82nd's commander, Major General Ridgway [...] "cautioned <b>me</b> <b>against</b> the machinations and scheming of General F. M. Browning, who was the senior British airborne officer, and well he should have." [...] Major-General Ray Barker told him that Browning was [...] "an empire builder", an assessment with which Gavin came to agree.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Temptations" [...] began in late 1993 when record {{producer}} Easy Mo Bee came to Shakur {{while he was}} on the set of Above the Rim (1994). At Rucker Park in New York City, Mo Bee approached Shakur with several different songs they could sample from in the <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World album. Out of the pieces he showed the rapper, Shakur favored the Zapp song [...] "Computer Love." [...] Despite being frequently sampled in the past by other artists, Shakur proposed that they simply speed up the tempo of [...] "Computer Love" [...] and use a low frequency automatic filter to retrieve the song's bassline.|$|E

500|$|... "Temptations" [...] {{is a song}} by rap artist Tupac Shakur (2Pac) {{from the}} album <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World. It was {{released}} as a single on August 29, 1995, and was released as a CD, cassette, and 12" [...] promo. While rapping is solely performed by Shakur, Erick Sermon and producer Easy Mo Bee are also featured in the song, primarily as background vocalists. The song uses the bassline from the [...] "Computer Love", and the theme focuses on relationship and infidelity issues. Debuting at number sixty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, the song did fairly well in the United States. It was also well received by critics, with many writers commenting on its romantic tone.|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff yelled at him {{to turn it off}} before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E
500|$|The up-tempo [...] "The Don" [...] samples Super Cat's 1982 song [...] "Dance inna New York" [...] {{and has a}} 1990s hip hop sound. Its lyrics extol both Nas' rapping prowess and New York City. According to No Ripcord's James McKenna, [...] "Stay" [...] mixes {{soul and}} jazz elements, [...] "bringing to mind Low End Theory era A Tribe Called Quest and Tupac's <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World, and lyrics [...] "questioning the line between love and hate". [...] "Cherry Wine" [...] {{features}} vocals by Amy Winehouse and a narrative between ill-fated lovers. The song was titled after Winehouse's guitar, which she called [...] "cherry". Jesal Padania of RapReviews cites it as [...] "quite possibly the best 'ladies number' that Nas has ever delivered, though it is infinitely classier than that label." [...] On [...] "Bye Baby", Nas' lyrics address his ex-wife and recount their marriage in a narrative that follows the wedding, counseling sessions, marriage counseling, and the legal process of their divorce.|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Cheo H. Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur's best {{and said it}} was [...] "by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation [...] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head-on". Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, called Shakur the [...] "St. Augustine of gangster rap" [...] due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle. In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that Shakur is [...] "witless" [...] when dealing with fundamental hip hop themes of persecution and accused him of [...] "self-pity": [...] "The subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard". [...] "This may be the first hip-hop blues LP," [...] observed Matt Hall in Select. [...] "Not so much in the music, although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin' Wolf than Tupac's previous two solo efforts, but more with Shakur's vocals, which are at once rebellious and resigned... <b>Me</b> <b>Against</b> the World is a statement of intent, a note from the depths of America, and a fine, thoughtful LP." ...|$|E

Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: [...] "It's always good to be nominated, especially for something {{as big as the}} Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. But you want that little gold record player. You just want to take it home." [...] The award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was presented to Nelly at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television. His performances of [...] "Hot in Herre" [...] and [...] "Dilemma" [...] alongside Rowland at the awards ceremony included pyrotechnics.
