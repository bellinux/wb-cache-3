40|$|The authors {{present a}} case of an 80 -year-old Caucasian male with {{multiple}} gastric and rectal metastases from malignant melanoma presenting with hypochromic anemia as the sole symptom of disease without evidence of cutaneous and ocular tumor localization. The patient had a medical history positive for <b>malignant</b> <b>lentigo</b> melanoma of the occipital region of the scalp and early stage laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and prostatic carcinoma treated with radiation therapy. The authors make some considerations on intestinal involvement by metastatic melanoma and discuss the choice of not treating with endoscopic procedures the gastric metastatic lesions most likely responsible for the clinical sign present at diagnosis. The patient was referred to clinical oncologists and received immunotherapy with ipilimumab and pembrolizumab...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the clinical and histological characteristics of melanoma in transplant recipients, the mutation profile (BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT genes), and the immune tolerance of the tumour microenvironment by immunohistochemical study of the expression of IDO, PD 1, PD-L 1, CD 8 and FoxP 3. The study population comprised patients who had undergone a renal transplant in Nantes University Hospital who developed post-transplantation melanoma. Twenty cases of melanoma out of 4, 663 transplant recipients were studied. The results differed from the usual data with respect to melanoma site: 40 % were located on the face and were of the <b>malignant</b> <b>lentigo</b> type. The mutation profile was concordant with that of the immunocompetent population. IDO was expressed in all the sections tested, while CD 8, FoxP 3, PD 1 and PD-L 1 were poorly expressed. This reflected a highly immunodepressed tumour environment, raising the question of the inductive role of IDO on tumour immune tolerance in patients presenting with long-term immunodepression...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> {{melanoma}} is a melanoma subtype {{of chronic}} sun-damaged skin in elderly Caucasians. Amelanotic variants of <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: This {{is a case}} report of an 80 -year-old male patient who presented with a non-pigmented exophytic tumour of his bald head. After complete surgical excision under the suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, three-dimensional histologic examination confirmed an amelanotic <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma with a tumour thickness of 1. 76 mm, resected R 0. Five years later he developed the first relapse, the other year a satellite metastasis was surgically removed. One year later, this patient had developed a large relapsing <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma with skull roof invasion. There {{was no evidence of}} distant metastatic spread. Amelanotic <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma is a very rare tumour. CONCLUSIONS: Serial excision or slow Mohs and Mohs micrographic surgery are the treatments of choice especially {{in the head and neck}} area. These tumours may be locally very aggressive as it is shown by skull invasion in the present case...|$|R
40|$|Lentigo maligna, a precancerous lesion, is a brown-black irregularly {{pigmented}} freckle, usually occurring on {{the face}} of the elderly subject. In a series of 99 patients with <b>malignant</b> melanomas, <b>lentigo</b> maligna was the pre-existing lesion in 21. The clinical and histological findings, and previous publications on the subject are reviewed. Lentigo maligna itself is not a superficial malignant melanoma. After the development of <b>malignant</b> melanoma from <b>lentigo</b> maligna, eight of 21 patients developed metastatic disease. This seems to indicate that once malignant melanoma has developed (whether de novo from the junctional portion of a pre-existing nevus, or from a lentigo maligna), the outlook is the same. During the development of <b>malignant</b> melanoma from <b>lentigo</b> maligna there is an indefinite period when it is virtually impossible to determine histologically whether malignant melanoma is present. Naturally, the inclusion of these indefinite cases will greatly influence reported results of treatment...|$|R
50|$|Nasal defects mostly {{result from}} {{excision}} of (malignant) skin tumours as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, <b>malignant</b> melanoma, keratoacanthoma, <b>lentigo</b> maligna, lymphoma, and sweat gland carcinoma. Other acquired nasal defects are usually caused by trauma, burns or sepsis.|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} hypothesized that lesions {{that have been}} termed lentigo maligna {{can be divided into}} 2 categories: 1 represents a pigmented lesion that is a precursor to melanoma, and the other melanoma in situ. We and others have hypothesized that there is a progressive acquisition of attributes in pigmented lesions that results in malignant melanoma. Based on these 2 hypotheses, we have predicted that the intraepidermal component of invasive <b>malignant</b> melanomas, <b>lentigo</b> maligna type, should be similar to those lesions that we have termed malignant melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type rather than lentigo maligna. The intraepidermal component of 42 consecutive cases of invasive <b>malignant</b> melanoma, <b>lentigo</b> maligna type was evaluated by all of the authors. Malignant melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type is characterized by pagetoid spread, confluence, and nesting of atypical melanocytes. All of the cases evaluated showed features diagnostic of malignant melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, in the epidermis overlying the invasive dermal component. We conclude that invasive lentigo maligna melanoma arises in association with those lesions that we have termed malignant melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, which may represent a step in the progression between atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (lentigo maligna) and invasive melanoma. This fording supports the distinction of these entities and may have therapeutic implications. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Intermittent or {{recreational}} {{exposure to}} sunlight {{is thought to}} contribute to development of human cutaneous melanoma. We investigated the incidence of ras oncogene mutation in human cutaneous melanoma in connection to sun-exposed body sites in the patient, using a large series of DNA samples derived from paraffin-embedded material {{as well as from}} fresh tumor samples and cell lines. We first show that, of the ras family, predominantly N-ras is activated (15 %), whereas rarely H-ras or K-ras are mutated. The occurrence of N-ras mutations correlates with continuous exposure to sunlight of the primary tumor site. Of all tumors initiated on chronically sun-exposed body sites, 26 % contained mutated N-ras, in contrast to 0 % of sun-protected melanomas. Melanoma lesions obtained from patients from North or Central Europe contained fewer N-ras mutations (12 %) as compared with patients from Australia (24 %). Mutations were specifically associated with nodular melanoma {{and to a lesser extent}} with <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma. N-ras mutations did not correlate with metastasis or survival parameters. This study identifies a subset of cutaneous melanomas that contain in the primary lesion ultraviolet-induced N-ras mutations, which are maintained through further progression...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{case-control study}} of 232 cases of {{cutaneous}} malignant melanoma and 232 matched controls {{was performed to}} assess the association of the disease with nonmelanotic skin tumors-basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and solar keratoses. There was a fourfold increase in risk of melanoma of all types when actinic tumors were present on the face. The risk was not restricted to the <b>lentigo</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma class {{as might be expected}} but was significantly raised for superficial spreading melanoma and nodular melanoma as well (relative risk, 2. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 7. 2). This relationship with lesions known to be associated with high-dose solar UV irradiation was supported by quantitative evidence that heavy sun exposure was associated with an increased risk of malignant melanoma. -JNCI 1985; 74 : 977 - 980. Epidemiologic studies provide much circumstantial evidence that solar UV irradiation {{plays an important role in}} the etiology of cutaneous malignant melanoma (1 - 3). However, the occurrence of many melanomas on areas of the skin only irregularly exposed to the sun suggests that the relationship is not as clear as the relationship of nonmelanoma skin cancers to chronic sun exposure in which the causative role has been established in epidemiologic (4, 5) and experimental (6, 7) studies. In explanation of the apparently different disease-exposure relationships, complex hypotheses and mathematicai models have been proposed regarding the action of solar UV irradiation in the pathogenesis of melanoma (8, 9). The aim of the present investigation was to obtain more specific information about the relationship of UV dose with cutaneous malignant melanoma by examining the frequency of occurrence in melanoma patients of BCC, SCC, and solar keratoses. A positive association between melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers suggests that cumulative sun exposure plays a common etiologic role. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data presented here were collected in the course of a case-control study of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Eligible case subjects were all persons resident in Queens-land who had a first primary cutaneous melanoma reported at routine diagnosis by a pathologist from Jul...|$|R
