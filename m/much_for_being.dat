25|$|AET {{salaries}} {{have also}} {{been a matter of}} controversy. In 2013 the press reported that the number of staff paid six figure salaries in AET had risen almost fivefold in a two-year period. Despite overall numbers of staffing dropping in 2014, the numbers of staff paid at the highest levels went up. So in 2013 there were 22 staff recorded with salaries between £100,000 and £229,000. In 2014 there were 26 staff paid in the same range. Jon Richards, the Education officer of the union UNISON said “The explosion in senior pay across many academy trusts {{over the past few years}} is completely disproportionate... In the same period, school support staff have endured year upon year of pay freezes and real-term pay cuts.” In a review of CEO pay in 2015 it was also noted publicly that Ian Comfort, the CEO of AET is responsible for 67 schools and was paid £220,000. However the CEO of Plymouth Cast Multi Academy Trust was paid £53,000 and is responsible for 35 schools. In terms of responsibilities for schools comparing these chains, Ian Comfort is therefore paid four times as <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> responsible for less than twice as many schools. By 2016 it was noted that Ian Comfort was earning £225,000, which represents a 2% increase on the £220,000 reported as salary in the previous year. At the same time, classroom teachers were limited to pay rises of just 1%.|$|E

Collum called Lazzara and Nolan's vocal delivery [...] "rapid-fire" [...] in a [...] "back-and-forth way, {{as if they were}} carrying on a dialogue, [...] allows you to really attach to and {{get a sense of the}} raw emotion behind the songs". In a retrospective review for Alternative Press, Brendan Manley wrote that the album [...] "is as close as it gets to a modern masterpiece, capturing not just a band at their apex, but an entire scene". According to Manley, Tell All Your Friends was [...] "the crossover breaking point, finally bringing what had been percolating for years in East Coast VFW Halls to the attention of the masses". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic wrote that the album features [...] "power chords and clean strums and palm muting and reverb". About whether this was negative, Freeman said, [...] "With songs this good, it shouldn't be ... It's all here, solid and undeniably catchy". Jonathan Bradley wrote for Stylus Magazine that although the album [...] "is notable not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a blueprint as it is a playbook", it would [...] "provide the perfect How-To guide for teenagers with guitars all over the United States and beyond." ...|$|E

60|$|The genuine English patriot {{will know}} that the {{strength}} of England has never depended upon any of these things; that the glory of England has never {{had anything to do}} with them, except in the opinion of a large section of the rich and a loose section of the poor which copies the idleness of the rich. These people will, of course, think too much of our failure, just as they thought too much of our success.

The truth is that athletics, like all other things, especially modern, are insanely individualistic. The Englishmen who win sporting prizes are exceptional among Englishmen, for the simple reason that they are exceptional even among men. English athletes represent England just about as much as Mr. Barnum's freaks represent America. There are so few of such people in the whole world that it is almost a toss-up whether they are found in this or that country.|$|E

And as {{my journey}} {{is almost always}} in the springtime, the twisted spire of the cathedral usually shows itself against the first grey of dawn, as we run out again southwards: and resolving to watch the sunrise, I fall more complacently asleep,--and the sun is really up by the time one has to change carriages, and get morning coffee at Macon. And from Amberieux, through the Jura valley, one {{is more or less}} feverishly happy and thankful, not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> in sight of Mont Blanc again, as in having got through the nasty and gloomy night journey; and then the sight of the Rhone and the Salève seems only like a dream, {{presently}} to end in nothingness; till, covered with dust, and feeling as if one never should be fit for anything any more, one staggers down the hill to the Hotel des Bergues, and sees the dirtied Rhone, with its new iron bridge, and the smoke of a new factory exactly dividing the line of the aiguilles of Chamouni.|$|E

After that had come the triumph of Brooke's visit, and then the terrible sadness of her aunt's displeasure. But now everything was good and glorious. She did not care for money herself. She thought that she never could care <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> rich. But had she made Brooke poor by marrying him, that must always have been to her matter of regret, if not of remorse. But now it was all to be smooth and sweet. Now a paradise was to be opened to her, with no apples which she might not eat;--no apples which might not, but still must, be eaten. She thought that it would be impossible that she should sleep again that night; but she did sleep, and dreamed that Brooke was holding her in Niddon Park, tighter than ever.|$|E
