50|$|The {{driving force}} behind the mill's {{construction}} was Hamilton Smith (1804-1875), a prominent attorney from Louisville, Kentucky. Smith's vision was to create a western <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> to rival Lowell, Massachusetts, but using steam-powered machinery fired by locally produced coal instead of the hydropower that ran the Lowell mills. The task proved too difficult for Smith and his associates, one of whom was Salmon P. Chase, later United States Secretary of the Treasury and Chief Justice of the United States, who became Smith's friend when both were students at Dartmouth College. Another was Indiana federal judge Elisha Mills Huntington. In 1851, control of the mill passed to brothers Dwight Newcomb (1820-1892) and Horatio Dalton Newcomb (1809-1874) who operated it successfully.|$|E
50|$|The {{fields of}} Richfield proved {{bountiful}} for the settlers. Early crops included corn, wheat and oats. Wheat immediately became the “cash” crop, {{sold in the}} area’s first major market, St. Paul. Those in the southern parts of Hennepin County found it more profitable to haul their wheat crop to St. Paul than to the St. Anthony Falls district. This occurred {{in the days before}} “King Wheat” and the evolution of Minneapolis into a <b>milling</b> <b>center.</b> In 1860 H. H. Hopkins of Richfield wrote to Minnesota Farmer and Gardener claiming he was getting a good yield of twenty-seven bushels of wheat per acre while handling the threshing himself. His oat yield varied from forty to seventy-five bushels per acre.|$|E

5000|$|Industrial mills {{began to}} appear along the Mississippi River near Saint Anthony Falls in the early 19th century. Utilizing the natural water power {{provided}} by the falls as well as cutting edge technological advances - the area quickly made Minneapolis the <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> of the upper Midwest. Within decades, the riverfront was literally lined with flour mills - including future corporate giants General Mills and Pillsbury. At its zenith, Minneapolis’ Mill District was the largest producer of flour in the world. The Mill District {{was part of the}} greater flour milling industry tied around Saint Anthony Falls. With mills stretching from the current Mill District {{to the other side of}} the Mississippi to Nicollet Island these mills prospered from the late-19th century to the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Following the war, Castleton {{continued}} to grow as an agricultural community. Farmers raised cattle, and then turned {{for a while to}} sheep. Saw mills and gristmills were the first industries established in town. During the 19th century the slate and marble industries thrived in and around Castleton. The railroad came in 1854, and {{the last half of the}} century saw the development of tourism around Lake Bomoseen. In the 19th century Castleton flourished, and many residents built elaborate houses to replace their log cabins and primitive frame houses. Several luxury hotels were built around the west end of the lake. A trolley system ran from the center of town to Lake Bomoseen, a destination for tourists vacationing during the summer. The Hydeville area flourished in the mid-19th century as a slate quarrying and <b>milling</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the late 1940s, discussions began about merging Ormsby County and Carson City. By this time, the county {{was little more than}} Carson City and a few hamlets to the west. However, the effort did not pay off until 1966, when a statewide {{referendum}} formally approved the merger. The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968. On April 1, 1969; Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as Empire City, which had grown up in the 1860s as a <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> along the Carson River and current U.S. Route 50. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its 146 sq mi of city limits.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1840s, {{the area}} around lake Manistee began {{attracting}} lumber and mill industries. Although the lake offered a fine natural harbor, access from Lake Michigan was limited due {{to a series of}} sand bars. To improve access, in 1854 a new channel was cut across the split of land to the west of Lake Manistee, at the location of the present channel. In 1867, legislation was passed allowing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to improve and maintain the channel, including reconstructing the piers at the entryway. The Manistee area remained an important logging and <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> {{through the rest of the}} 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Manistee was producing upwards of 138,000,000 ft of lumber and 28,000,000 shingles per year, most of which was shipped through the harbor.|$|E
5000|$|Washburn Library, {{formerly}} Washburn Community Library, is {{a public}} library in the Hennepin County Library system. Opened in September 1970, Washburn Library, located at 5244 Lyndale Avenue South, began with a footprint of 14451 sq ft and approximately 18,000 books. Designed by Brooks Cavin, an architect who studied under Walter Gropius and Eero Saarinen, Washburn reflected mid-century modernism. Set near Minnehaha Creek, Washburn {{meets the needs of}} Southwest Minneapolis in a picturesque neighborhood. Patron traffic quickly rose and broke all records: to meet demand, library staff requested other branches to share their materials. Phonograph albums and children's books were particularly popular. In the first year of service, Washburn circulated 273,000 books, higher than any other Minneapolis Public Library branch at the time. [...] Named for William D. Washburn, who was a founder of Washburn-Crosby Milling Company, and a United States Senator, Washburn Library's public art includes a millstone, honoring Minneapolis' heritage as a grain <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Washburn-Crosby Milling Company is now known as General Mills.|$|E
5000|$|Dayton is at {{the western}} end of the Twenty-Six Mile Desert at a bend in the Carson River. Immigrants {{stopping}} there for water would consider whether to follow the river south or continue west, giving the location its first name, Ponderers Rest. In 1849, Abner Blackburn, while heading for California, discovered a gold nugget in nearby Gold Creek, one of the tributaries of the Carson River. By 1850, placer miners settled at the mouth of Gold Cañon, working sand bars deposited over the millennia along the path of the creek. At first the settlement was just called Gold Cañon or Gold Cañon Flat. Throughout the 1850s, Dayton served as the commercial hub for miners working in the canyon. In 1857 many Chinese miners came to the area to avoid mining taxes directed at the Chinese in California. With the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode, newly founded Gold Hill and Virginia City, six miles to the north, assumed prominence and most miners headed up the cañon. By 1860 the town was primarily occupied by Chinese miners and it was called [...] "China Town" [...] in the U.S. census of that year. However, soon people began to realize there was more profit in providing milling, goods, and services to the miners and thus came or returned to the area. In 1861, the town officially adopted the name Dayton, after John Day, a local surveyor who later became Surveyor General of Nevada. On November 29, 1861, Dayton became the governmental seat for Lyon County. [...] Because of the availability of water from the Carson River, it soon became the first major <b>milling</b> <b>center</b> of the Comstock, and grew rapidly—from 78 residents in 1860 to 2500 in 1865. Its 1864 courthouse {{was one of the first}} in Nevada. [...] In 1866 and 1870 devastating [...] "Great Fires" [...] in Dayton greatly reduced the size of the town. The 1869 opening of the Virginia & Truckee Railroad shifted ore processing upstream to the Carson River Canyon, but Dayton continued to serve as a lesser center of commerce and government. Nonetheless, in the 1870s it was a much quieter, less prosperous town. The coming of the Carson & Colorado Railroad in 1881 brought back some prosperity to Dayton, but the population nonetheless hovered around 500 residents until after World War I.|$|E
