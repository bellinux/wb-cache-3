As a necessary evacuation route, it's very important for both evacuation and firefighting to ensure the effectiveness of smoke exhaust in corridor. While in mechanical exhaust system in corridor, the height of the exhaust port is a main factor that influences the smoke exhaust effect.

The surface azimuth had greater effect on solar radiation collection in high latitude regions. For deviation of the surface slope angle within ± 20 ° around the optimized angle, the variation of the total annual collecting solar radiation was less than 5 %. However, with deviation of 70 ° to 90 °, the variation was up to 20 %. The effects of water cycle mode, reverse slope placement of solar collector, and water tank <b>installation</b> <b>height</b> on system efficiency were experimentally studied. The thermal efficiencies of solar water heater with single row horizontal arrangement all-glass evacuated tubular collector were higher than those with vertical arrangement at the fixed surface slope angle of 90 °.

Tall and large spaces typically contain large fire loads {{that can lead}} to a rapid increase in temperatures during an accidental fire. Conventional {{fire suppression}} systems are not able to extinguish fires in tall and large atria. The water droplets distinguished from sprinkler systems can either be vaporized or carried away by the fire-induced hot air currents in tall and large spaces. In this thesis, the fundamental principles of rapid and effective fire extinguishment, the major findings and limitations of existing sprinkler systems widely used were identified first. A side-wall long-throw sprinkler system is then proposed. The characteristics of the system including their structure, flow coefficient, operating pressure, sprinkler head distance and <b>installation</b> <b>height</b> were then studied. The experimental portion of the study was started by establishing the key experiment parameters for the long-throw sprinkler, including the use of a 10 MW fire. Appropriate wood cribs were selected as the experimental fire in this study. The heat release rate characteristics for different arrangements of wood cribs with different numbers of wood cribs and placements were explored. Tests were conducted on the water distribution qualities of sprinklers in a hall with different <b>installation</b> <b>heights</b> of 6 m, 8 m and 10 m under operating pressures of 0. 2 MPa, 0. 35 MPa, and 0. 5 MPa respectively. The results were used to justify numerical simulations. Experimental results are then correlated with the most desirable water distribution characteristics for proposing design practices. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was then used to study the performance of proposed side-wall long-throw sprinkler systems. Two sets of four scenarios on sprinkler fire were adopted for CFD-FDS simulation. The size distribution of water droplets, sprinkler flow effectiveness, sprinkler head design, fire extinguishing system activation time and heat transfer characteristics between smoke and sprinkler water droplets were studied. For medium hazard classes, sprinklers with flow coefficients 115 and 161, <b>installation</b> <b>heights</b> higher than 10 m and operating pressure of 0. 5 MPa are found to be appropriate for extinguishing fires. Full-scale experiments were conducted on sprinkler fire for justifying CFD-FDS predictions. Important technical requirements for designing sprinkler for tall and large halls are the proportion of large water droplets discharged from the sprinkler system reaching the fire. The concept of Actual Delivered Density and Required Delivered Density were applied to evaluate the performance of sprinkler systems. Results from full-scale experiments are consistent with those from the mathematical models. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of fixed weirs in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different <b>installation</b> locations and <b>heights.</b> As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of fixed weirs, their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps.
