All <b>modules</b> have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different <b>modules</b> share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independentlyâ€”the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other <b>modules.</b>|$|E
