5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and <b>mental</b> <b>impairment,</b> while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey of}} Youth Offending Teams by the British Institute for Brain Injured Children in 2005 showed that 38% of ASBOs went {{to young people}} with {{significant}} mental disorders.

In fiscal year 2011, the most prevalent primary <b>mental</b> <b>impairments</b> among children found medically eligible were (1) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, (2) speech and language delay, and (3) autism, with autism claims growing most rapidly since fiscal year 2000.

It is argued that capacity-based mental health laws, rather than providing a progressive approach to law reform, may simply reinforce presumptions that those with <b>mental</b> <b>impairments</b> completely lack decision-making capacity and thereby should not be afforded legal capacity. A better approach may be to shift the current focus on notions of capacity to socio-economic obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities...|$|R
25|$|McGruder’s {{second term}} (2112–2116) was {{initially}} successful, despite {{the mental health}} problems which she had acquired during the interval, but her <b>mental</b> <b>impairment</b> became worse over time. She suspended the Council of Five (as noted above) in favour of calling forums of senior judges if and when needed. Among several misguided policies was a controversial scheme to use robot judges to alleviate a serious shortage of human judges, continually trying to force the scheme through even though the robots repeatedly malfunctioned and killed people. After a robot attempted to kill her, she was eventually persuaded to resign again. An Interim Council of three judges ruled briefly until a new chief judge was elected.|$|E
25|$|The term consent is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or <b>mental</b> <b>impairment.</b> There {{are two types of}} consent being reviewed; explicit consent and presumed consent. Explicit consent consists of the donor giving direct consent through proper registration depending on the country. The second consent process is presumed consent, which does not need direct consent from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed consent assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated twenty-five percent of families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. Consent is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals. However, this definition is hard to enforce in accordance with organ donation because, in most cases, organs are donated from the deceased, and can no longer provide consent for themselves.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this paper, the term {{disability}} will encompass the following impairments: disability that can increase vulnerability to abuse resulting from physical, sensory, or <b>mental</b> <b>impairments,</b> or a combination of impairments; physical disability resulting from injury (e. g., spinal cord injury, amputation), chronic disease (e. g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), or congenital conditions (e. g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy); sensory impairments consisting of hearing or visual impairments; and <b>mental</b> <b>impairments</b> comprising developmental conditions (e. g., <b>mental</b> retardation), cognitive <b>impairment</b> (e. g., traumatic brain injury), or mental illness. Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} questions that arose during negotiations on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons (CRPD) concerned whether or not health interventions could ever be performed without the recipient’s consent. This is particularly important in relation to persons with severe <b>mental</b> <b>impairments</b> whose consent to or refusal of treatment may be rendered irrelevant under mental health or guardianship legislation. In its General Comment No 1, the United Nations CRPD Committee has stated that States Parties have an obligation to require mental health practitioners to obtain the free and informed consent of persons with disabilities prior to any treatment. This article analyses recent case law in Australia that indicates that while there has been some attention paid to human rights breaches in relation to the detention of persons with <b>mental</b> <b>impairments</b> for treatment purposes, there is a large gap between what the CRPD Committee requires and the ‘weak’ protection that continues to be afforded in relation to informed consent to medical treatment...|$|R

It will be concluded that an interdisciplinary study is needed in order to achieve appropriate guidelines which take the wishes and vulnerability of the severely mentally impaired as well as their carers and parents into account...|$|R
