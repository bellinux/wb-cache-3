5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
25|$|Would you ask <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} have asked <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> run the Naval Reactors Program, {{so that they might}} find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E

2500|$|Albanese {{was noted}} {{for the grace}} with which she {{performed}} La traviata under the maestro's famously intense direction. [...] "Maria Callas once asked <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> ever got through it, but Toscanini wanted it that way," [...] Albanese later recalled. [...] "'It should be like champagne,' he said. I complained to him, and he said, 'You can do it.' Before I sang the part, I went to a hospital to study the behavior of people with tuberculosis and I learned that sometimes they can be hysterical." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{supplement}} his income, {{the young}} Domingo {{played the piano}} for a ballet company, [...] {{as well as for}} a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for Los Camisas Negras in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: [...] "Today, when people ask <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then." ...|$|E
