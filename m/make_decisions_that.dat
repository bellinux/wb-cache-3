25|$|Collaborative {{planning}} {{arose in}} the US {{in response to the}} inadequacy of traditional public participation techniques to provide real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities. Collaborative planning is a method designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision-makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies, to solicit ideas, active involvement, and participation in the community planning process. Active public involvement can help planners achieve better outcomes by making them aware of the public’s needs and preferences and by using local knowledge to inform projects. When properly administered, collaboration can result in more meaningful participation and better, more creative outcomes to persistent problems than can traditional participation methods. It enables planners to <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> reflect community needs and values, it fosters faith in the wisdom and utility of the resulting project, and the community is given a personal stake in its success.|$|E

25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes.

25|$|The {{landings}} of Allied forces (the British) and the provocation {{from the}} Dutch, caused {{some of the}} pemuda into a panic. On 13 October 1945, the pemuda decided to react strongly by resorting to violence towards the Allied forces. During the fight, two Indonesians and one Ambonese woman were killed. The tide of pemuda violence then spread from Medan to Pematang Siantar within two days and many including the Dutch, Ambonese, pemuda and Swiss were killed {{as a result of}} the fight. On 18 October 1945, the control of Medan became British’s responsibility, immediately after official orders were issued by Republican leaders for pemuda to surrender their weapons to the British troops. Nonetheless, the pemuda of East Sumatra managed to acquire some weapons that were left over by Japanese soldiers after the surrender and used them to confront the British in the south of Medan on 10 December 1945. A strong sense of contingency was said to be present in the British policy as the political circumstances in Indonesia has forced them to <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> were seemingly neither pro-Dutch nor pro-Indonesian.

After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years.

500|$|Elías also {{discussed}} the three different strategies seen within the independence movement, electoral participation, civil mobilization and clandestine struggle. Ojeda Ríos reaffirmed his stance that independence {{would not be}} achieved in elections, but conceded that things beneficial to it could be, suggesting that the electoral opposition needed to [...] "radicalize" [...] its opposition and asking Rúben Berrios to discuss his differences with other organizations within the independence movement. On the other hand, he expressed that the civil society was progressing slowly {{due to a lack}} of leadership and coherence. Ojeda Ríos justified the vigency of armed resistance, also distancing itself from terrorism, dictatorship or coups. He {{also discussed}} his close friendship with Rafael Cancel Miranda and confided that the EPB had been covertly publishing documents about armed resistance that in his view were gathering this tactic support from the public. When questioned by Elías about the reason behind the move from a mostly paramilitary strategy to also include activism, Ojeda Ríos quoted that several other armed organizations had spent prolonged periods in preparation before stricking, citing 15 years of inactivity by the zapatistas while it gathered the support of Amerindian groups, the initial movements in Vietnam during the 1930s and the organization of the French Revolution as examples. Ojeda Ríos gave his opinion of then-Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño to this journalist, labeling him as [...] "a person with no dignity", [...] "who is totally submitted to the will of the United States government" [...] and [...] "does not <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> favor the people".

2500|$|Among {{the goals}} of BioShock 2s {{developers}} was to capitalize or improve aspects of the first game that were received less positively.

Thomas said that even players who enjoyed the minigames became [...] "numb" [...] to it after repetition; {{the replacement of the}} mini game with hacking that didn't allow you to pause the game added more urgency to the gameplay. Another aspect was the choice to harvest or save Little Sisters; by allowing players to adopt the Little Sisters before deciding their fate, Thomas hoped it would help players form a bond with the characters and think about their choice. Among the other goals the developers had for the sequel was adding more unspliced characters and give players a greater chance to <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> impacted the course of the game.

Further, Western RPGs {{are more likely to}} allow players to create and customize characters from scratch, and since the late 1990s have had a stronger focus on extensive dialog tree systems (e.g. [...] ).
