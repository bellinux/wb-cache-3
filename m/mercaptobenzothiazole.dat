40|$|We report 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and its analogs as a {{class of}} new {{matrices}} for matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) at 337 nm. MBT has been used successfully for the desorption of proteins up to 100, 000 u. A comparison with sinapinic acid and α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid indicates that MBT provides {{the same level of}} sensitivity and resolution, but offers the advantage of higher tolerance to sample contaminants such as ionic detergents. 5 -Chloro- 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (CMBT), an analog of MBT, has been found not only effective for the analysis of peptides, low-mass proteins, and glycolipids, but also superior to conventional matrices for the analysis of muropeptides and at least some oligosaccharides. CMBT also exhibits excellent experimental reproducibility of MALDI-MS results owing to the homogeneous crystallization of the analyte/matrix mixture over the entire sample surface area.

50|$|Of {{the primary}} accelerators the major group used in tire {{manufacture}} is formed by sulfenamides.

Such a slow accelerator is required in the steel cord adhesion compound mentioned above, because for optimal adhesion a slow cure is required.Another important group of primary accelerators is formed by the thiazoles. The two main products are mercaptobenzthiazole (MBT) and mercaptobenzthiazole disulfide (MBTS), a product formed by oxidative coupling of two MBT molecules. The thiazoles are used for the vulcanization of thick articles, and as basic accelerator in EPDM compounds (ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers), in combination with mixtures of ultra-accelerators.|$|E
5000|$|Anaphylaxis to ionic (high osmolar) {{contrast}} agent injections occurred in two clusters of reactions {{on two occasions}} (1983 and 1987) in a single radiology clinic in London, Ontario. On each occasion, these anaphylactic reactions were associated with contamination of the injection by natural rubber components (disposable plastic syringes {{in the first case}} and rubber ampoule seals in the second case). The allergenic-toxic rubber leachate was MBT (<b>mercaptobenzothiazole).</b> This is a known allergen that becomes bound to plasma proteins, creating a hapten-protein complex - a signature mechanism in true IgE drug allergy and true anaphylactic reactions (not [...] "anaphylactoid" [...] reactions). [...] A Japanese syringe manufacturer, Terumo, implicated in syringe-related toxic laboratory cell culture effects in Australia in 1981, was instrumental in pro-actively making Japanese disposable syringes and ampoule seals free of natural rubber. Katayama's 1990 article in Radiology showed that a new type of nonionic (low osmolar) {{contrast agent}} was associated with significantly fewer severe life-threatening reactions than the older ionic (high osmolar) contrast agents.

40|$|Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde eine analytische Methode für den Nachweis von Benzothiazolen entwickelt. Da Bakterien oft eine große Rolle bei der Transformation von organischen Stoffen in Wasser spielen, wurde der Bio-Abbau (anaerob/aerob) der Verbindungen untersucht. Desweitern wurde das photolytische Abbauverhalten der Verbindungen untersucht. Die polaren Benzothiazole wie Benzothiazol Sulfonsäure (BTSA) und Hydroxybenzothiazol (OHBT) können mit guten Wiederfindungsraten über polare Polymer-Phasen (EN-Phase) extrahiert werden. Die andere Analyten zeigten gute Wiederfindungen auf Silicagel-Kartuschen. Aufgrund der hohen Kapazität wurden RP 18 und EN Material für eine sequentielle Fest-Phasen-Extraktion der Benzothiazole gewählt. Geringfügig niedrigere Wiederfindungsraten wurden für die Extraktion der Benzothiazole aus komplexer Matrix (Kläranlagenzu- und ablauf) festgestellt. Mischkulturen aerober Bakterien können Benzothiazole als Kohlenstoff-, Stickstoff- und Energiequelle nutzen. In separaten Batch-Tests mit Mischkulturen aerober Bakterien wurde das Verhalten von Benzothiazol (BT), Hydroxybenzothiazol (OHBT), Mercaptobenzothiazol (MBT) und Methylthiobenzothiazol (MTBT) untersucht. BT und OHBT können in wässrigen Medien mikrobiell in verhältnismäßig kurz Zeit abgebaut werden. MTBT erwies sich unter analogen Bedingungen als stabil. MBT wird unter aeroben Bedingungen zu MTBT methyliert. In einem Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) konnten Benzothiazol Sulfonsäure (BTSA), Methylthiobenzothiazol (MTBT) und geringe Mengen an Dithiobisbenzothiazol (MBTS) nachgewiesen werden. Anaerobe Behandlungen zeigten keine Transformation von Hydroxybenzothiazol, während Methylthiobenzothiazol zum Teil abgebaut wurde. Mercaptobenzothiazol wurde zum Teil metabolisiert zu Hydroxybenzothiazol. Benzothiazol Sulfonsäure wurde zum Teil umgewandelt zu Hydroxybenzothiazol. OHBT konnte erst nach 5 Wochen zusammen mit anderen unbekannten Substanzen nachgewiesen werden. Bezüglich Thiocyanomethylthiobenzothiazol (TCMTB), ist OHBT neben MBT somit ein wichtiger Metabolit. Unter photolytischen Bedingungen sind Mercaptobenzothiazol und methylthiobenzothiazole nicht stabil. In Wasser und Abwasser konnten zwei stabile Photoprodukte, Benzothiazol (BT) and Hydroxybenzothiazol (OHBT), nachgewiesen werden. In {{the present}} study, an {{analytical}} method for the determination and extraction of benzothiazoles {{in water and}} wastewater was developed. Because bacteria are important agents in transforming most organic compounds, their specific roles in biotransformation of benzothiazole compounds in water was explored. The biodegradability of these compounds by using aerobic and anaerobic conditions was investigated. Additionally, the photochemical degradation of benzothiazoles was studied. The polar benzothiazole compounds such as benzothiazole sulfonic acid (BTSA) and hydroxybenzothiazole (OHBT) are well recovered from the polar polymer phases. The other analytes show good recoveries on the silicagel-cartridges. Based on their high capacity, RP 18 and EN were chosen for a sequential solid phases-extraction of benzothiazoles. The recovery rates of the solid-phase extraction (SPE) from sewage treatment plants effluents and influents are slightly decreased compared to those obtained with tap water but remained acceptable and are full satisfied. Aerobic mixed cultures are capable of utilising benzothiazoles as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. Benzothiazole (BT), hydroxybenzothiazole (OHBT), <b>mercaptobenzothiazole</b> (MBT) and methylthiobenzothiazole (MTBT) were investigated in separate batch tests. Benzothiazole and hydroxybenzothiazole can be microbially degraded in water {{in a relatively short}} time, whereas methylthiobenzothiazole was proved to be stable under aerobic conditions. <b>Mercaptobenzothiazole</b> was methylated to methylthiobenzothiazole. By using the Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR), <b>mercaptobenzothiazole</b> was transformed to benzothiazole sulfonic acid (BTSA), methylthiobenzothiazole (MTBT) and traces of dithiobisbenzothiazole (MBTS). Anaerobic treatment revealed no transformation of hydroxybenzothiazole whereas, methylthiobenzothiazole was partly degraded. <b>Mercaptobenzothiazole</b> was partly metabolised to BT and BTSA was partially transformed to OHBT, which was not observable earlier than 5 weeks together with other unknown substances that were not identified. Concerning thiocyanomethylthiobenzothiazole (TCMTB), BT is beside MBT an important metabolite.

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} to rubber {{is caused by}} residues of chemicals used in manufacturing a rubber product. Several different additives are used to achieve a final product of the desired characteristics. Accelerators such as thiurams, dithiocarbamates, and mercaptobenzothiazoles are often among the additives responsible for allergic reactions recognized by dermatologists. The chemistry of the vulcanization process is complicated; as it occurs at an elevated temperature {{with a mixture of}} reactive chemicals, the compositions of the initial and final products differ. This paper investigates the changes in composition of common allergens during vulcanization, doing so by chemically analysing various rubber formulations at different stages of the process. Major changes were found in which added chemicals were consumed and new ones produced. An important observation is that thiuram disulfides rarely appear in the final rubber although they may have been used as additives.

40|$|The first hyperpolarizability (beta) of {{a series}} of half-sandwich Ru {{complexes}} with a <b>mercaptobenzothiazole</b> ligand bearing a halogen atom substitution in the para-position has been investigated by hyper-Rayleigh scattering and quantum chemical calculations. The heterocyclic ligand with a bromine atom in the para position makes it a very good donor and charge flows to the Ru center enhancing the beta value of the complex by a factor of 2 compared to the complex with the ligand without the halogen substitution. The resonance (+R) and the inductive (-I) effects exerted by the halogen atom in the para position push electrons in opposing directions in the complex. For the Br and Cl atoms the resonance effect dominates which enables the ligand to donate electrons to the metal center thereby increasing the hyperpolarizability whereas for the fluorine atom, the inductive effect is dominant which reduces the charge flow to the metal and the hyperpolarizability drops even below that of the unsubstituted ligand. This unprecedented halogen atom effect on beta of metal complexes is reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|E

Electron transfer kinetics of negatively charged redox probes like ferrocyanide ions is blocked when the surface pKa pHmedium reversible features is observed for negatively charged probes. An exactly reverse effect is observed in the case of positively charged redox species like [Ru(NH 3) 6] 2 +/ 3 +. Cu under potential deposition studies reflects the structural integrity and compactness of the SAM layer. The utility of these monolayers and mixedmonolayer for selective sensing of dopamine is discussed based on their ability to discriminate between positively and negatively charged redox species at different pH...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{rates of}} Cu single crystal { 100 }​, { 110 }​, and { 111 } planes were detd. in a stirred 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4 soln. contg. 10 -​ 6 -​ 10 -​ 3 mol <b>mercaptobenzothiazole</b> (I) by using wt. loss and polarization techniques. The corrosion rate {{controlled by a}} surface reaction was a function of crystallog. orientation, temp., and I concn. Stability of the 3 crystal orientations in the uninhibited acid soln. was in the order { 111 〉 > { 100 } > { 110 }​. However, at the crit. I concn. of 10 -​ 3 mol, the stability order was { 110 } > { 100 } > { 111 }​. The obsd. corrosion data indicated inhibition by surface adsorption of inhibitor mols., following the Bockris-​Swinkels adsorption isotherm (1964) ​. The wt. loss and polarization techniques gave similar inhibitor efficiency values. The order of stability of the crystal planes was further confirmed by a thermodn. study of inhibitor mol. adsorption. The formation of I-​Cu(I) films from the surface reaction of cuprous ions with adsorbed I acts as a barrier against the corrosive environment...|$|E
40|$|Neutral half-sandwich {{organometallic}} ruthenium(II) complexes of {{the type}} (? 6 -cymene) RuCl 2 (L) ] (H 1 H 10), where L represents a heterocyclic ligand, have been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. The structures of five complexes were also established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirming a piano-stool geometry with ? 6 coordination of the arene ligand. Hydrogen bonding between the N?H group of the heterocycle and a chlorine atom attached to Ru stabilizes the metalligand interaction. Complexes coordinated to a <b>mercaptobenzothiazole</b> framework (H 1) or mercaptobenzoxazole (H 6) showed high cytotoxicity against several cancer cells but not against normal cells. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} the inhibition of cancer cell growth involves primarily G 1 -phase arrest as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The complexes are found to bind DNA in a non-intercalative fashion and cause unwinding of plasmid DNA in a cell-free medium. Surprisingly, the cytotoxic complexes H 1 and H 6 differ in their interaction with DNA, as observed by biophysical studies, they either cause a biphasic melting of the DNA or the inhibition of topoisomerase IIa activity, respectively. Substitution of the aromatic ring of the heterocycle or adding a second hydrogen-bond donor on the heterocycle reduces the cytotoxicity...|$|E
