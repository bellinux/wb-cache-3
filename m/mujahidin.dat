Individual ′iṣābāt began forming in the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances, but Hananu gradually consolidated them into his network.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, {{the roles}} of Pakistan and Afghanistan reversed, despite the fresh {{crackdown}} on Baloch and Pashtun nationalists {{by the government of}} Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Pakistan government decided to retaliate against the Afghan government's Pashtunistan policy by supporting Islamist opponents of the Afghan government including future <b>Mujahidin</b> leaders Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud. This operation was remarkably successful, and by 1977 the Afghan government of Mohammed Daoud Khan was willing to settle all outstanding issues in exchange for a lifting of the ban on the National Awami Party and a commitment towards provincial autonomy for Pashtuns, which was already guaranteed by Pakistan's Constitution, but stripped by the Bhutto government when the One Unit scheme was introduced.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{military}} expertise, formal military {{language and}} style {{was important to}} rebel commanders as they sought to instill in their soldiers the [...] "spirit, self-image and shape of an army", according to historian Nadine Méouchy. During meetings of the rebel leadership, the <b>mujahidin</b> of the host leader assumed military formation by lining up along the road of the host village and saluting the visiting commanders. The rebels referred to themselves as junūd al-thawra (sing. jundi), meaning [...] "soldiers of revolt", which represented a more noble image than the term iṣābā, which was associated with banditry, and the term al-askar, which referred to the military and had negative connotations due to its association with conscription and repression. Each mujahid received a salary depending on his rank, with cavalrymen (fursan) or officers receiving higher pay than foot soldiers (mushāt).|$|E
500|$|Hananu {{gained the}} backing of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, which {{consisted}} of numerous educated professionals, wealthy merchants and Muslim religious leaders. The committee provided him with arms and funds, and helped promote his armed campaign among the city's Muslim scholars as well as put Hananu in touch with Ibrahim al-Shaghuri, head of the Arab Army's Second Division. On orders from the Arab government in Damascus, Hananu formed an ′iṣābā in Aleppo consisting of seven men from his native Kafr Takharim, who he armed with hand-held bombs and rifles. With al-Shaghuri's assistance, Hananu later expanded his ′iṣābā to forty fighters, known as <b>mujahidin</b> (fighters of a holy struggle), from Kafr Takharim and organized them into four equal-sized units. According to historian Dalal Arsuzi-Elamir, {{the small size of}} each unit made them highly mobile and [...] "able to inflict chaos on French troops". Hananu used his family's farm in the regional administrative center of Harim as the headquarters of his branch of the Committee of National Defense.|$|E

There is widespread dissent among the masses against the activities of Christian missionaries. These missions exploit the poverty of Afghan people and they pay them to convert. These activities will only translate into fierce reaction as Afghans do not tolerate anything against their religion. Since Abdul Rahman comes from Panjshir, people of the area are coming down to Kabul to show their dissent against him and demand that the court execute him." ...|$|E

He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual Fathul <b>Mujahidin,</b> and is considered a pioneer in the use of rocket artillery. He deployed the rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Seringapatam.
