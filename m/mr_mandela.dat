2500|$|... : Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{released}} a statement, [...] "With {{the death of}} Nelson Mandela, the world has lost one of its great moral leaders and statesmen. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mandela</b> was imprisoned for 27 years by the former Government of South Africa, {{for his part in}} the struggle that would ultimately end the system of apartheid. Despite his long years of captivity, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mandela</b> left prison with a heart closed to calls for a settling of scores. Instead, he was filled by a longing for truth and reconciliation, and for an understanding between all peoples. He demonstrated that the only path forward for the nation was to reject the appeal of bitterness. His forbearance was legendary: his magnanimity spared all South Africans incalculable suffering. Nelson Mandela's enduring legacy for his country, and the world, is the example he set through his own 'long walk to freedom.' With grace and humility, he modelled how peoples can transform their own times and in doing so, their own lives. On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, Laureen and I extend our condolences to Mr. Mandela's widow, Graça Machel, his entire family and all citizens of South Africa. Canada, a nation that granted <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mandela</b> honorary citizenship in 2001, mourns with you and the entire world today." ...|$|E
