40|$|This article {{presents}} the current problems with measuring distance in goods wagons. The main pro-blem where goods wagons are concerned is {{their lack of}} power supply. Owing to this, a distance-me-asuring system is hard to install. Meanwhile, the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> and the service processes dependent on this measurement {{are becoming more and}} more important. Moreover, the railway accident in Viareggio on June 29, 2009 has resulted in increased interest in determining the accurate mileage of a wagon or, to be exact, of a wheelset. One has to realise, that a goods wagon is actually a combination of numerous elements (such as the body, the underframe, the carriage, the wheelsets, etc.) that can differ in mileage and can be exchanged between different wagons. This makes it necessary to register not only the mileage of the whole wagon, but also, at a minimum, of the carria-ge. This article is an attempt at outlining the current state of this issue...|$|E
40|$|The {{blind person}} cannot often take {{advantage}} of skilled learned, such as taking care of day to day needs without the capacity to successfully travel. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for navigation aids to help the blind to be independant from the help of a normal sighted person, and to be able to walk journeys which have not previously been rehearsed. As part of this, there is a particular need for a device to enable the distance travelled by a blind walker to be determined continiously as the journey progresses. In this paper, the proposed method of measuring distance is to use the acceleration of a moving body which in this case is the blind person. The technique well known in air-craft navigation systems of using an accelerometer and double integrating its output gives a <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> This method suffers from drift of the integrators and offset of the accelerometer. An innovation in the present paper is a suggested way to overcome this problem by the use of a footswitch when the blind walks...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There {{are clear}} personal, social and {{environmental}} benefits of cycling. However, safety concerns are among the frequently cited barriers to cycling. In Australia, there are no exposure-based measures of the rates of crash or ‘near miss’ experienced by cyclists. Design and setting: A prospective cohort study over 12 months, with all data collected via web-based online data entry. Participants: Two thousand adults aged 18 years and older, living in New South Wales (Australia), who usually bicycle {{at least once a}} month, will be recruited from March to November 2011. Methods: In the 12 months following enrolment, cyclists will be surveyed on 6 occasions (weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 from the week of the enrolment survey). In these survey weeks, cyclists will be asked to provide daily reports of distance travelled; time, location and duration of trips; infrastructure used; crashes, near misses and crash-related injuries. Information on crashes and injuries will also be sought for the intervening period between the last and current survey. A subsample of participants will receive bicycle trip computers to provide objective <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> Discussion: This study protocol describes the prospective cohort study developed to assess near misses, crashes and injuries among cyclists by time and distance travelled and by type of infrastructure used, with recruited participants entering data remotely using the internet. We expect to be able to calculate event rate according to exposure overall and for different infrastructure types and to report in-depth information about event causation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the aqueous extract of Achillea millefolium on recognition memory in mice. Methods: Male mice (35) were used. The aqueous extract of A. millefolium was prepared using a Soxhlet apparatus and injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 50, 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg daily for 20 days. The control group was treated with saline 1 ml/mouse/day. Tactile learning was assessed using the novel object recognition test (NORT) in a dark room which entailed <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> during trial and test phases. Results: Treatment with different doses of A. millefolium did not affect activity levels (based on the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> during trial and test phases). The total time and frequency of visits to the sample objects in trial and test phases were not statistically significant between control and A. millefolium treated groups (p> 0. 05). A comparison of the discrimination ratio between the experimental groups revealed no difference. Administration of A. millefolium extract for 20 days did not decrease body weight or cause death in the treated animals. Conclusion: The result of this study demonstrates that chronic treatment with different doses of th...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the mobile}} mapping {{activity}} in Australia {{has been applied}} to the mapping of railways. Over the last decade the process has evolved from one narrowly focused upon establishing the position of track centrelines to one which includes the position and geometry of the track, imagery and detailed attributes of all trackside features. This broader perspective has been required as the mobile mapping processes have become a core requirement for the development of railway asset management systems. Positioning sensors installed on the mapping platform include GPS receivers (differential pseudo-range), shaft encoders for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>travelled</b> <b>distance,</b> direction sensors and tilt meters. Measurements from these sensors are taken at regular epochs and a Kalman filter is employed to integrate these and compute strings of 3 D coordinates to locate the track centerline. The location of trackside features is achieved through photogrammetry, the number and configuration of the cameras being determined by the level of detail required. The preferred form of representing railway track geometry is as a continuous series of straights and curves with defined tangent points. Whilst the need for this form of geometry arises out of a business requirement for the management of the track as an asset, the representation of the track in this format has additional benefits. These include improving the accuracy of the track centreline position and providing a simple mechanism for combining a number of sets of track centreline data into a single spatial database. This paper reviews the processes used to map track centrelines and discusses the algorithms employed in reducing the coordinate strings to the required geometric format. In the horizontal plane, the string of coordinates provided by the Kalman filter is reduced t...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{sediment}} mobility {{in a large}} gravel-bed river (Tagliamento River, northeastern Italy). Field {{data were}} used to identify the morphological effectiveness {{of a range of}} flows (floods with recurrence interval b 1 to 3. 5 year) and for a detailed analysis of the partial transport condition. The analyses were carried out on three cross sections where a number of areas representative of different morphological units (main and secondary channels, low and high bars, islands) were painted. Grain size of the painted area was measured using a photographic method. Monitoring of bed mobility during the study period supplied new photographs of the painted areas, <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> size and <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the mobilized particles, and estimate of flow depth after each flood event. Our analyses have shown that with dimensionless shear stress around 0. 073 (17 N m− 2), the morphological effect over the painted areas was primarily partial transport; while with stresses N 0. 1 (25 N m− 2), the bed experienced full mobility, i. e., all the painted particles were transported or totally buried. Full sediment mobility was observed on lower morphological units (i. e., main and secondary channels) under floods with very high frequency (RIb 1 y), whereas on the low bars full mobility occurred under floods with a recurrence interval slightly N 1 year. Instead, fine deposition and partial transport conditions were observed on the higher bars even after the largest of the monitored floods (RI= 3. 5 y). The analysis of the partial transport condition relies on more than 3500 <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> particle <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> (<b>travel</b> <b>distances</b> range from a few centimetres up to 22 m). The transported particles were generally finer than the painted sediments, and the analysis of the sediment transport ratio revealed that partial transport occurred under equal-mobility conditions for particles finer than 32 mm and under sizeselective mobility for coarser fractions. This appears to be corroborated (for Db 32 mm) by the insensitiveness <b>of</b> particle transport <b>distance</b> to particle sizes, even if the exponent (≈ 1) {{of the relationship between the}} dimensionless shear stress and the maximum transported diameter would suggest that all fractions are transported under equal-mobility conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that time series {{analyses}} of road safety and risk can be improved by using demographic data. We demonstrate that the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by drivers or riders of a certain age reflects the fluctuations over the years of the number of people of that age within the population. We further demonstrate that the change over time <b>of</b> per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> i. e. <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> per person, is often less subject to stochastic fluctuations, and therefore more smooth than the total <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for drivers <b>of</b> that age. This smoothness is used to obtain forecasts <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> or to average out year-to-year fluctuations <b>of</b> data <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> such data stratified by age group, gender or both reveals that, for most travel modes, per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> is to a large extent constant or slowly changing over time. The consequences for the evaluation of risk, i. e. casualties per <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> with and without the use of population data, are explored. Dutch data are used to illustrate the model concept. It is shown that the analyses and forecasts <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> could gain substantially by incorporating demographic data, as compared to an analysis with data <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> alone. The paper further shows that, for an analysis of risk and therefore for traffic safety forecasts in the absence of any data <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> stratified analysis <b>of</b> mortality, i. e. casualties per inhabitant, may be a reasonable alternative.

In this paper, model-based estimates <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities measure of accessibility. Multivariate, spatially expanded models produce estimates <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> that are specific to both geographical location and type of individual.

The indicators proposed are demonstrated with a case study of food deserts in the city of Montreal, Canada. The results of the analysis illustrate the variations in accessibility between individuals in low-income households and the reference group, and the effect of vehicle ownership for accessibility to food services, thus highlighting the social exclusion implications of these factors. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the drifts of Inertial Navigation System (INS) {{solutions}} are inevitable and also grow over time, a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) {{is used to}} aid the INS to restrain its error growth.

In the present study, using a similar experimental procedure, this result was confirmed. It was also established that combining the translational optical flow with simulated head oscillations (similar to those during natural walking) improved the subjects’ perception <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> in comparison with a purely translational flow. This improvement may be attributable to the fact that an optic flow pattern resembling that associated with walking enhances the path integration process. In a subsequent experiment, we investigated whether it was the biological or the rhythmical characteristics of the simulation that enhanced the subjects’ estimates <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> The results obtained confirm that adding rhythmic components to the optic flow pattern improved the accuracy of subjects’ perception <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> However, no significant differences between biological and rhythmical oscillations were detected. These results relate to recent studies on the effects of smooth and jittering optic flows on vection onset and strength. One possible conclusion is that oscillations may increase the global retinal motion and thus improve the vection and path integration processes. Another possibility is that the nonmonotonous pattern of retinal motion induced by oscillatory inputs may maintain optimum sensitivity to the optic flow over time and thus improve the accuracy of subjects’ perception <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled...</b>|$|R
