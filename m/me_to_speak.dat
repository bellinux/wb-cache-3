The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.|$|E
500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, they want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E
500|$|Knights of Labor leader Terence Powderly {{wrote in}} a letter to W.W. Stone (excerpts of which he {{included}} in a report to the U.S. Congress) that, [...] "It is not necessary for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of the numerous reasons given for the opposition to this particular race – their habits, religion, customs and practices..." [...] Powderly blamed the [...] "problem" [...] of Chinese immigration on the failings of the 1882 Exclusion Act. He faulted lax law enforcement, not those involved in the riots, for the attacks at Rock Springs. Powderly wrote that the U.S. Congress should stop [...] "winking at violations of this statute" [...] and reform the laws which barred Chinese immigration, which he believed could have prevented incidents such as [...] "the recent assault upon the Chinese at Rock Springs".|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{operation}} MASK (19341937), an MI5 counterspy infiltrated the party, and {{was for a}} time Pollitt's {{assistant and}} a clandestine radio operator. [...] This allowed John Tiltman and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between Moscow {{and some of its}} foreign parties, such as the CPGB. [...] They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. [...] Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. [...] "At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign". Pollitt went on to complain that he was [...] "kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal".|$|E
