5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
25|$|As a result, C60 {{in water}} tends {{to pick up}} two more {{electrons}} and become an anion. The nC60 described below {{may be the result}} of C60 trying to form a loose <b>metallic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E

50|$|Otherwise, <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> {{can be very}} strong, even in molten metals, such as Gallium. Even though gallium will melt {{from the}} heat of one's hand just above room temperature, its boiling point is not far from that of copper. Molten gallium is {{therefore}} a very nonvolatile liquid thanks to its strong <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bonded cover wafers must be {{attached}} with an adhesive. Two options are used, a glass frit bond ring or a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> ring. The glass frit {{has been found}} to generate too much contamination, and thus drift, and is no longer commonly used.|$|E
500|$|The {{melting point}} of a {{substance}} is {{the point where it}} changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling {{point of a}} substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.) ...|$|E

25|$|The charged {{components}} {{that make up}} ionic solids cannot exist in the high-density sea of delocalized electrons characteristic of strong <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding.</b> Some molecular salts, however, feature both ionic bonding among molecules and substantial one-dimensional conductivity, indicating a degree of <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> among structural components along the axis of conductivity.

50|$|The strong bonding {{of metals}} in the liquid form {{demonstrates}} that the energy of a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> is not a strong function of {{the direction of the}} metallic bond; this lack of bond directionality is a direct consequence of electron delocalization, and is best understood in contrast to the directional bonding of covalent bonds. The energy of a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> is thus mostly a function of the amount of electrons which surround the metallic atom, as exemplified by the Embedded atom model. This typically results in metals assuming relatively simple, close-packed crystal structures, such as FCC, BCC, and HCP.|$|E

5000|$|Forge welding is {{a process}} of joining metals by heating them beyond a certain {{threshold}} and forcing them together with enough pressure to cause deformation of the weld surfaces, creating a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> between the atoms of the metals.

50|$|Atoms {{of metals}} readily lose their outer shell electrons, {{resulting}} in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement. This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity. While this flow of electrons occurs, the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud. This type of bond is called a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E

50|$|For in-situ bonded face sheets {{the core}} is {{closed-cell}} foam. The goal of in-situ bonding {{is to create}} a metallic bonding between the foam core and face sheets. This is achieved in three ways. A foamable precursor is expanded between two face sheets. When the liquid foam comes in contact with the solid face sheets a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond</b> is established. This is difficult to realize as the oxidation of both aluminium face sheets and foam prevent forming a sound bonding. There is also a risk of melting the face sheets. This procedure is successful when steel is used as face sheets instead of aluminium, while the foam core is aluminium.|$|E

50|$|Colloidal or {{eutectic}} soldering {{was used}} by the Etruscans, and employs a colloidal mixture of tragacanth gum and copper salts. The mixture lowers the melting points of both granules and base, and causes the copper to diffuse into both at the point of contact, creating a strong <b>metallic</b> <b>bond.</b> The colloidal solder is painted onto the surface of the base, and the granules arranged on the wet solder using a fine brush, after which the piece is left to dry. It is then fired in a reducing kiln causing the tragacanth to burn off and release the copper salt. At the eutectic temperature (890 °C) the copper diffuses into the granules and base, joining them together.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of a non-crystalline form of a gold-silicon alloy by the method of splat quenching from the melt led to further considerations {{of the influence of}} electronic structure on glass forming ability, based on the properties of the <b>metallic</b> <b>bond.</b> Other work indicates that the mobility of localized electrons is enhanced by the presence of dynamic phonon modes. One claim against such a model is that if chemical bonds are important, the nearly free electron models should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge distribution between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.|$|E
5000|$|When light falls onto a {{block of}} metal, it {{encounters}} atoms that are tightly packed in a regular lattice and a [...] "sea of electrons" [...] moving randomly between the atoms.

In a <b>metallic</b> <b>bond,</b> any potential bonding electrons can easily be lost by the atoms in a crystalline structure.

50|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> {{is a type}} of {{chemical}} bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions.

50|$|Metal {{aromaticity}} {{in metal}} clusters {{is another example}} of delocalization, this time often in three-dimensional entities. Metals take the delocalization principle to its extreme and one could say that a crystal of a metal represents a single molecule over which all conduction electrons are delocalized in all three dimensions. This means that inside the metal one can generally not distinguish molecules, so that the <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> is neither intra- nor intermolecular. 'Nonmolecular' would perhaps be a better term. <b>Metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> is mostly non-polar, because even in alloys there is little difference among the electronegativities of the atoms participating in the bonding interaction (and, in pure elemental metals, none at all). Thus, <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> is an extremely delocalized communal form of covalent bonding. In a sense, <b>metallic</b> <b>bonding</b> is not a 'new' type of bonding at all, therefore, and it describes the bonding only as present in a chunk of condensed matter, be it crystalline solid, liquid, or even glass. Metallic vapors by contrast are often atomic (Hg) or at times contain molecules like Na2 held together by a more conventional covalent bond. This is why it is not correct to speak of a single 'metallic bond'.|$|R
