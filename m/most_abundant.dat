5|$|Carbon is the 15th <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> {{element in}} the Earth's crust, and the fourth <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> {{element in the}} {{universe}} by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element {{in the human body}} and the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the {{physiology}} and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> {{element in}} the Earth's crust and the 25th <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in its oceans, {{with an average of}} 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> {{element in the}} Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission {{discovered}} a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> iron isotope 56Fe is of {{particular}} interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in the core of red giants, and is the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight. Iron is the sixth <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in Earth's crust and the third <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, one of the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E

5|$|Many metals are geologically <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> as ionic {{compounds}} within ores. To {{obtain the}} elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or electrolysis, in which redox reactions occur (often with a reducing agent such as carbon) {{such that the}} metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element on Earth, but only the fourth <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-98 is the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> isotope, {{comprising}} 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life {{of about}} 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns.

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element overall and the <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
