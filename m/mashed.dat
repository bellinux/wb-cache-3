5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are <b>mashed</b> into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans <b>mashed</b> with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
40|$|<b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2, {{mammalian}} homologues of the Drosophila neural determination genes achaete-scute, {{are members}} of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. We show here that murine P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells {{can be used as a}} model system to study the regulation and function of these genes. <b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2 display complementary patterns of expression during the retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of P 19 cells. <b>MASH</b> 1 mRNA is undetectable in undifferentiated P 19 cells but is induced to high levels by retinoic acid coincident with neuronal differentiation. In contrast, <b>MASH</b> 2 mRNA is expressed in undifferentiated P 19 cells and is repressed by retinoic acid treatment. These complementary expression patterns suggest distinct functions for <b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2 in development, despite their sequence homology. In retinoic-acid-treated P 19 cells, <b>MASH</b> 1 protein expression precedes and then overlaps expression of neuronal markers. However, <b>MASH</b> 1 is expressed by a smaller proportion of cells than expresses such markers. <b>MASH</b> 1 immunoreactivity is not detected in differentiated cells displaying a neuronal morphology, suggesting that its expression is transient. These features of <b>MASH</b> 1 expression are similar to those observed in vivo, and suggest that P 19 cells represent a good model system in which to study the regulation of this gene. Forced expression of <b>MASH</b> 1 was achieved in undifferentiated P 19 cells by transfection of a cDNA expression construct. The transfected cells expressing exogenous <b>MASH</b> 1 protein contained E-box-binding activity that could be super-shifted by an anti-MASH 1 antibody, but exhibited no detectable phenotypic changes. Thus, unlike myogenic bHLH genes, such as MyoD, which are sufficient to induce muscle differentiation, expression of <b>MASH</b> 1 appears insufficient to promote neurogenesis...|$|R

5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was <b>mashed</b> between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone.|$|E

5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} <b>mashed</b> potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E

5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup.

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from <b>mashed</b> cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
