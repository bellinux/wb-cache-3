40|$|Abstract—Spectrum sensing is a low-complex and {{interesting}} {{way to find}} unused white spaces for secondary users transmission in cognitive radio. Because radio frequencies are strategic resource, their reallocation is required to ensure enough capacity for future communication devices. In addition to commonly used frequencies, <b>millimetric</b> <b>waves</b> have been proposed {{to be used for}} communication to fulfill upcoming needs. Because of broad operating area, adaptive spectrum sensing methods are needed to manage in different noise environments. For that reason, noise measurements were performed at several frequency areas between 10 MHz and 39 GHz. The goal was to study the noise properties in different frequency areas. Statistical properties of measured noise areas were analyzed and compared also with theoretically generated noise. The results show that histograms, PSDs and CDFs are almost equal. However, it was noticed that there is a huge difference between the noise levels, so sensing method that adaptively sets the detection threshold is required. The localization algorithm based on the double-thresholding (LAD) method was used as a blind and adaptive sensing method. The LAD method {{is based on the assumption}} that the noise is Gaussian. The probability of detection and false alarm were studied. It was shown that the LAD method operates well in all studied frequency areas.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. In {{order to}} address rain {{attenuation}} scattering of <b>millimetric</b> <b>waves</b> and microwave sin Botswana, we have employed a comparison technique to determine the Ro. o 1 at fourteen diverse locations in Botswana. In addition we have identified two rain climatic zones for Botswana. We note that Matzler employs Mie Scattering technique to determine the specific attenuation due to rain in Central Europe. Both Matzler and Olsen use the exponential distribution of N(D) to calculate y. In this dissertation we use the Mie scattering approach, but assume several distributions, including the log-normal distribution of N(D) as expounded by Ajayi et aI., to determine y for tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The {{results show that the}} extinction coefficients depend more strongly on temperature at lower frequencies than at higher frequencies for lognormal distribution: at selected frequencies, we record high attenuation values at rising SHF bands: at 300 GHz, tropical showers take on values of 12, 12. 5, 11. 9 and 14 dB/km for Gaborone, Francistown, Kasane and Selebi-Phikwe, respectively. The absorption coefficient is significant but decreases exponentially with rain temperature at lower microwave frequencies. The application of the proposed model (Continental Thunderstorm is shown using practical results from Durban) is corroborated using practical results from Durban. Further, based on attenuation measurements, it is found that the lognormal distribution is suitable for Durban at rain rates {{greater than or equal to}} 21 mm/h. At rain rates below this, the loss-Thunderstorm is the better fit. Finally in this dissertation the results show that for rainfall intensity below about 10 mm/h for Marshall-Palmer (MP), Joss-Drizzle (JD), Joss-Thunderstorm (JT) and Law-Parson (LP) distributions, and below about 4 mm/h for Continental-Showers (CS), Tropical Showers (TS), Continental Thunderstorms (CT) and Tropical Thunderstorm (TT) distributions, the specific rain backscattering follows Rayleigh scattering law where the rain drops are small with respect to the wavelength when the frequency is 19. 5 GHz. At rain rates above 10 mm/h for exponential distribution, and above 4 mm/h for lognormal distribution, the specific backscattering follows Mie scattering law. When the received echo power from rain becomes significant, it contributes to the rise in the noise floor and the radar receiver can lose its target. In addition, the result shows that Mie backscattering efficiency is highest at a raindrop diameter of 4. 7 mm...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of <b>millimetric</b> <b>waves</b> in satellite communications requires {{the use of}} advanced transmission techniques known as Propagation Impairments Mitigation Techniques (PIMT) to counteract severe atmospheric phenomena without excessive power expenditures. Among these PIMTs we remind Adaptive Code Modulation (ACM), reconfigurable antenna pattern, site diversity, up/down link power control and others. The possibility to exploit profitably this concept is based on the knowledge coming from the propagation science, i. e. on accurate models for the space- and time-distribution of impairments such as rain attenuation and to allow their experimental validation through measurements. The TDP 5 Q/V Band Propagation Payload, which has been renamed as Alphasat Aldo payload to the memory of Prof. Aldo Paraboni, who conceived and greatly contributed to its realization, will allow in the near future further propagation and telecom measurements across Europe. The mission will allow a direct assessment of the advantages obtainable from PIMTs like the ACM or reconfigurable on-board antenna. The payload has been supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as in-kind contribution to the Alphasat project which is executed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the ARTES 8 Telecom programme. Alphasat will be launched in 2013. The Aldo payload will permit simultaneous measurements of attenuation and depolarisation at 20 and 40 GHz during a long period (some years) all over Europe. In addition the Aldo payload will enable telecom Q/V experiments at the stations located within the 3 narrow spot beams covering Austria, North and South Italy. As for the ground segment, ASI assumed directly the commitment to realize the deployment and realization of the Earth terminals in Italy with the support of Politecnico di Milano and Univ. Tor Vergata as Principal Investigators for the propagation and telecommunication experiments, respectively. One of these terminals will be placed at the experimental station of Spino d'Adda (near Milan, North of Italy); another one will be installed in Tito Scalo (South of Italy). A third Earth Terminal for the telecom experiment is being developed by Joanneum Research (in the framework of an ESA ARTES 8 activity {{with the support of the}} Austrian Aeronautics and Space Agency) and it will be installed in Graz, Austria. As well, in order to enlarge the significance of this experiment, the development of additional propagation ground terminals for Alphasat has been assigned by ESA within the ARTES- 5 programme for Telecom technology development to Joanneum Research and Graz University of Technology.
