We have explored the potential of using the velocity fields of seismic S- and P-waves to delineate the wet and gassy (relatively dry, gas/air-filled) zones inside a landfill. We have analyzed shallow S- and P-wave reflection data and seismic surface-wave data acquired at a very heterogeneous landfill site, where biogas was extracted. A joint interpretation of the independently estimated velocity fields from these various approaches has allowed us to localize anomalously low- and high-velocity zones in the landfill.

A good metal laminate is formed when the wettability between the dropping metal powder and the substrate adheres.

40|$|A batch {{fabrication}} {{process at the}} wafer-level integrating ring microelectrodes into atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips is presented. The {{fabrication process}} results in bifunctional scanning probes combining atomic force microscopy with scanning electrochemical microscopy (AFM-SECM) with a ring microelectrode integrated at a defined distance above {{the apex of the}} AFM tip. Silicon carbide is used as AFM tip material, resulting in reduced <b>mechanical</b> <b>tip</b> wear for extended usage. The presented approach for the probe fabrication is based on batch processing using standard microfabrication techniques, which provides bifunctional scanning probes at a wafer scale and at low cost Additional benefits of batch fabrication include the high processing reproducibility, uniformity, and tuning of the physical properties of the cantilever for optimized AFM dynamic mode operation. The performance of batch-fabricated bifunctional probes was demonstrated by simultaneous imaging micropatterned platinum structures at a silicon dioxide substrate in intermittent (dynamic) and contact mode, respectively, and feedback mode SECM. In both, intermittent and contact mode, the bifunctional probes provided reliable correlated electrochemical and topographical data.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) imaging at the {{nanoscale}} {{is a key}} {{to understanding}} of nanomaterials and complex systems. While scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been the workhorse of nanoscale metrology, its slow scanning speed by a single probe tip can limit the application of SPM to wide-field imaging of 3 D complex nanostructures. Both electron microscopy and optical tomography allow 3 D imaging, but are limited to the use in vacuum environment due to electron scattering and to optical resolution in micron scales, respectively. Here we demonstrate plasmonic Brownian microscopy (PBM) as a way to improve the imaging speed of SPM. Unlike photonic force microscopy where a single trapped particle is used for a serial scanning, PBM utilizes a massive number of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) under Brownian diffusion in solution to scan in parallel around the unlabeled sample object. The motion of NPs under an evanescent field is three-dimensionally localized to reconstruct the super-resolution topology of 3 D dielectric objects.

40|$|Liquefaction - hazard {{assessment}} is often accomplished {{by means of}} simplified procedures, {{which are based on}} CPT. The CPT liquefaction procedures, generally, require cone penetration test with electrical tip or the measure of u (CPTu); however, in most countries, as Italy, penetrometric tests are carried out with <b>mechanical</b> <b>tip</b> (CPTm). Generally, CPTm leads to an estimate of the Liquefaction Potential lower than that inferred from CPTu. Moreover, CPTm has a reduced resolution in soil profiling. While the cone – shape effects on qc are not very relevant, those on fs can strongly influence the FSL calculation, {{especially in the case of}} silty sands. Within this framework, the main aim of this work is to identify the differences in liquefaction - hazard evaluation and soil profile interpretation in pairs of CPTm/CPTu. After that, two methodologies were used to correct CPTm results. At first, it was developed an empirical correlation between the sleeve friction measured with CPTm and that measured with electrical CPT/CPTu. After that, a method developed in literature was applied to the same CPTm/CPTu pairs. The two corrections were compared in order to see which one led to the best results in terms of enhancement of the liquefaction {{hazard assessment}} and soil profile reconstruction.

40|$|Abstract—Current {{approaches}} {{to study the}} system response of the different modes of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) use model simplification such as single mode approximations or {{are based on the}} nontrivial solution of the equation of motion. As an alternative to these approaches, the transfer function analysis gives a more complete description of system dynamics considering the cantilever as an extended vibrating structure. In order to describe the dynamics correctly, the precise experimental configuration has to be taken into account. This includes distinguishing between point loads (<b>mechanical</b> <b>tip</b> sample interaction) and distributed loads induced, e. g., by inertial driving or electrostatic forces. In this work we focus on a transfer function study of two different AFM configurations, the point force and distributed force driven cantilever. Exact analytical expressions of the infinite dimensional transfer function are derived for both possible system outputs: cantilever deflection and slope, which correspond to an interfero-metric and a light lever deflection detection system, respectively. Frequency response and transfer function infinite product expan-sion are obtained for the case where system outputs are set at the free end of the cantilever. In the frequency response, it is reflected the full complexity of cantilever dynamics affected by the presence of an infinite number of poles and zeros. An analytical expression for all the zeros and poles of the system is obtained. Using the transfer function, system dynamics are analyzed obtaining modal and antiresonant cantilever shapes along with its step response. From the frequency response, pole-zero investigations, and system dynamics, it is shown that both cantilever actuation and output measurement affect AFM operation. Transfer function analysis of AFM cantilevers improves the possibility of model-based AFM operation to increase imaging and manipulation performance.

The subject {{of the project was}} the imaging of glowing workpieces in a measurement range of 1 m [...] . 2 m. Traditionally the workpieces are measured with high time-expenditure after cooling with <b>mechanical</b> <b>tips.</b> Using a new-developed modulation schema of ultra-high carrier injection for SH lasers (single-heterostructure laser) ultra-short optical super-spikes could be generated (e. g. 90 W peak power, 44 ps pulse-width) improving the ranging accuracy essentually. Moreover, the averaged emitted optical power is also for high repetition rates less than 1 mW meaning that the laser emission is eye-safe (class 1 -laser). The nonlinearity of the photodetectors results in signaldynamic dependent ranging values. For MSM-, PIN-and avalanche-photodiodes nonlinear device models have been derived {{on the basis of a}} physical and experimental modelling approach which allow an amplitude-dependent measurement error correction. This is exemplarily demonstrated for a MSM photodiode. The realised laser radar with a repetition frequency of 40 kHz has a radial measurement uncertainty of 300 #mu#m. The standard deviation is 86. 1 #mu#m. A lateral resolution of #<=# 1 mm has been obtained. The maximum temperature of the glowing test subjects was 850 C. For reason of the applied sampling principle the system should be used for precise single-point 3 D-measurements. In conclusion, it has been shown for the first time, that pulsed laser radar systems are well-suited for measuring tasks in the micrometer range. Further improvements due to measurement velocity and accuracy are possible (broadband laser radar with single-pulse evaluation). The results concerning the ultra-high carrier injection are also interesting for the ultra-short laser spectroscopy to generate extremely high optical power and pulse energies in the #mu#J region.

Design of the sensor is modular since each individual sensing element could be easily changed, tested and calibrated. All parts of sensor has been fabricated by mechanical micromachining and precisely assembled, which increases design and manufacturing exibility. In this thesis, the mechanical design of the sensor that uses the piezoelectric e ect for detection of sound is presented. First, a computational analysis method which predicts the dynamic response of the designed sensor is developed. Then, a tigthly controlled vibration experiment platform is set up to emulate the e ect of {{the motion of the}} acoustic particle. The computational simulations are then validated with initial experiments and the design of the sensor is nalized. by Alper Yasin Tiftikçi. M. S...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Impaction {{grafting}} with bone particles is {{a successful}} technique to restore bone stock loss during hip revision surgery. Allograft shortage is expected within the near future. This study investigates the feasibility of porous titanium particles (TiP) to replace bone particles (BoP) and to compare <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>TiP</b> and a commercially available porous ceramic bone graft extender (CeP). Impactability and time-dependent mechanical properties (stability and stiffness during physiologic loading (0. 1 - 2. 5 MPa)) were assessed by standardized impaction and a confined compression test. Loaded samples were used for particle release analysis. FINDINGS: TiP were more impactable than BoP and created a stable, highly entangled macroporous construct. CeP were crushed during impaction, resulting in non-cohesive specimens of small ceramic particles. TiP showed very little deformation {{at the end of}} physiological loading. Impacted TiP were stiffer than BoP but more elastic than CeP. TiP generated a low volume of microparticles (0. 2 % of original TiP weight) with a bimodal size distribution (diameter range, 7 - 2000 microm). CONCLUSION: TiP are impactable and create a stable, elastic and highly entangled, macroporous layer. Further in-vitro testing and biological studies are warranted to verify whether the promising results are maintained with THA reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|The {{fascinating}} {{capability of}} cellular self-organization during tissue development and repair {{is a central}} question in developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Understanding the dynamic morphogenic and regenerative processes of biological tissues will have important implications in biology and medicine. Nevertheless, the elucidation of the cellular self-organization processes is hindered {{by a lack of}} effective tools for monitoring the spatiotemporal gene expression distribution and a lack of ability to perturb the self-organization processes in living cells and tissues. Multimodal modularities that allow both single cell perturbation and gene detection are required to enable a new paradigm in the investigation of complex tissue morphogenic processes. To address this critical challenge in the field of developmental and regenerative medicine, we are developing a multimodal gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid (GNR-LNA) composite for single cell gene expression analysis in living cells and tissues at the transcriptional level. Using antisense RNA sequences, we design LNA probes for detecting specific molecular targets in living cells. The LNA probes bind to the GNR spontaneously due to the intrinsic affinity between the GNR and LNA. In close proximity, the fluorescent probes are effectively quenched by the GNR. Therefore, a fluorescent signal is only observed when the specific target thermodynamically displaces the LNA probe from the GNR. Furthermore, the GNR also serves as a transducer for photothermal ablation. Thus, we established a novel modularity for imaging the spatiotemporal gene expression distribution in living cells and tissues. The single cell analysis capability of our techniques enables us to adopt a unique approach to study the tissue regenerative processes during normal development and diseases, and this will have a profound impact on regenerative medicine and disease treatment in future. Moreover, we applied this GNR-LNA probe to explore the endothelial cell mRNA dynamics during capillary morphogenesis. Three different types of cells were identified due to their different roles during endothelial cell capillary-like formation process. Our findings indicated that the endothelial cell behavior {{is directly related to the}} Dll 4 mRNA expression, and Dll 4 expression in ECs determine the cell fate. Our GNR-LNA probe enable us to investigate the correlations between Dll 4 mRNA expression and cell behavior during capillary morphogenesis. Experimental results indicated that: (1) When the endothelial cells aggregate, the cells migrate with certain displacement, the Dll 4 mRNA expression decreases. (2) When the endothelial cells sprout, the cells migrate with small displacement but the cell shape changes to an ellipse shape, the Dll 4 mRNA expression begin to increase. (3) When the endothelial cells elongate and form cell-cell contract with adjacent cells, the Dll 4 expression decreased to a certain level and keep stable until the cell activity change to another stage. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated endothelial cells compete for the leader cell position during wound healing, collective cell migration, and tip cell formation during angiogenic process. It has been demonstrated that endothelial cells compete for the tip cell formation through Notch signaling pathway. However, how the <b>mechanical</b> force regulates <b>tip</b> cell formation is still unclear, and if mechanoregulation of tip cell formation through Notch pathway still unknown. Mechanical and chemical regulations of tissue morphogenesis and angiogenesis are being investigated in both in vitro capillary-like network formation assay and in vivo mice retina angiogenesis assay. Here, we investigated the mechanoregulation of mechanotransduction of tissue morphogenesis and angiogenesis using both in vitro endothelial cell tube formation model and in vivo mice retina blood vessel development model. Our results demonstrated that (1) Notch pathway negatively regulates tip cell formation: inhibition of Notch pathway (DAPT) enhances tip cell formation, induces Dll 4 and Notch 1 activity, activation of Notch pathway (Jag 1 peptide) inhibits tip cell formation, suppresses Dll 4 and Notch 1 activity. (2) Mechanical force negatively regulate tip cell formation: (a) Decrease mechanical force via Rho kinase inhibitor Y- 27632, myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin, or laser ablation, enhances tip cell formation and induces Dll 4 activity through mediation of Dll 4 -Notch 1 lateral inhibition, (b) increase mechanical force via traction force inducer Nocodazole and Calyculin A, suppresses tip cell formation and inhibits Dll 4 activity through activation of Notch pathway. (3) Mechanical force negatively regulates tip cell formation partially via mediation of Notch pathway. Mechanical force is necessary for tip cell formation and negatively regulate tip/stalk selection via Dll 4 -Notch 1 lateral inhibition. Interruption of <b>mechanical</b> force enhance <b>tip</b> cell formation via suppression of Dll 4 -Notch 1 lateral inhibition, thus resulting the increase of Dll 4 expression. Enhance of <b>mechanical</b> force inhibits <b>tip</b> cell formation via activation of Dll 4 -Notch 1 lateral inhibition, thus resulting the decreases of Dll 4 expression. All these finding wills have great significance for various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, cancer, and drug screening...|$|R
40|$|Materials exhibiting {{a strong}} {{piezoelectric}} effect {{may be used}} in many applications, where they serve as sensors, actuators or transducers. These applications range from for sub-millimeter length scales in MEMs (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) up to large scales in the the design of smart wings in the aerospace industry. As for regular materials subjected to high mechanical stresses, the knowledge of fracture behavior for these smart materials is often crucial within the design of parts under high electrical and mechanical loading. The Extended Finite Element Method [1] has been originally designed for crack growth analysis in isotropic elastic materials. In association with level-sets [2] as a mean for representing the crack geometry, it is a powerful {{way to get rid of}} the costly constrained remeshing needed with conventional techniques. Under certain circumstances, this method is also able to achieve regular convergence rates in the energy error even for a cracked domain [3]. Piezoelectric materials exhibit an transversely isotropic mechanical characteristic, as well as a coupling between mechanical and electrical variables. This leads to different near-crack <b>tip</b> <b>mechanical</b> fields and the presence of singularities in the electrical variables [4][5]. To treat this new problem in the X-FEM, specific crack analysis tools and changes in the enrichment functions are needed which allows to represent the crack- both in the mechanical and electrical functional spaces. In this work, we will present these techniques and perform a convergence analysis to ensure that the crack tip behavior is accurately taken into account. Finally, we suggest a simple propagation model for crack growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{polycrystal}} {{finite element}} (FE) model describing the temperature evolution of {{low carbon steel}} is proposed in order to forecast the local mechanical fields {{as a function of}} temperature, for bainitic microstructure submitted to tri-axial loading. The model is designed for finite strains, large lattice rotations and temperatures ranging into the brittle–ductile transition domain. The dislocation densities are the internal variables. At low temperature in Body Centred Cubic (BCC) materials, plasticity is governed by double kink nucleation of screw dislocations, whereas at high temperature, plasticity depends on interactions between mobile dislocations and the forest dislocations. In this paper, the constitutive law and the evolution of the dislocation densities are written as a function of temperature and describe low and high temperature mechanisms. The studied aggregates are built from Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) images of real bainitic steel. The aggregate is submitted to a tri-axial loading in order to describe the material at a crack <b>tip.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> parameters are deduced from mechanical tests. The local strain and stress fields, computed for different applied loadings, present local variations which depend on temperature and on tri-axial ratio. The distribution curves of the maximal principal stresses show that heterogeneities respectively increase with temperature and decrease with tri-axial ratio. A direct application of this model provides the evaluation of the rupture probability within the aggregate, which is treated as the elementary volume in the weak link theory. A comparison with the Beremin criterion calibrated on experimental data, shows that the computed fracture probability dispersion induced by the stress heterogeneities is of the same order than the measured dispersion. Temperature and stress tri-axiality ratio effects are also investigated. It is shown that these two parameters have a strong effect on fracture owing to their influence on the heterogeneous plastic strain. These inhomogeneities can initiate cleavage fracture...|$|R
