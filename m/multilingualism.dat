5|$|As European Commissioner for <b>Multilingualism</b> in the Barroso Commission, Orban was {{responsible}} for the language policy of the European Union, i.e. promoting <b>multilingualism</b> for the citizens and the institutions of the European Union. He was the first to hold this portfolio. <b>Multilingualism</b> has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and <b>Multilingualism,</b> Ján Figeľ, the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included <b>multilingualism.</b>|$|E

5|$|Leonard Orban (born 28 June 1961) is a Romanian {{independent}} technocrat {{who served}} as the Commissioner for <b>Multilingualism</b> in the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU). He was responsible for the EU language policy and was the first Romanian Commissioner and the first member of the Commission whose portfolio is exclusively <b>multilingualism.</b> His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in engineering and economics, Orban has taken up various posts working for the accession of Romania to the European Union, most prominently as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The Babatha Archive is a suggestive {{example of}} <b>multilingualism</b> in the Empire. These papyri, {{named for a}} Jewish woman in the {{province}} of Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.|$|E
5|$|Administratively, Orban was {{in charge}} of the Directorate-General (DG) for Translation, the DG for Interpretation and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, as well as the <b>Multilingualism</b> policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the DG for Education and Culture. In total, Orban is {{responsible}} for overseeing 3,400 staff (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 2006, in {{agreement}} with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of <b>multilingualism.</b> Before Orban, Varujan Vosganian, a former Romanian National Liberal Party Minister of Economy and Commerce, had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under Ceauşescu and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu refused a nomination.|$|E
5|$|Steering the <b>multilingualism</b> {{language}} {{policy of}} the EU, Orban focused on promoting foreign language learning through EU programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.|$|E
5|$|Trilingualism {{was perhaps}} not {{uncommon}} among educated {{people who came}} from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother. The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical <b>multilingualism.</b> These papyri, named for a Jewish woman {{in the province of}} Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.|$|E
5|$|<b>Multilingualism</b> {{had been}} {{characteristic}} of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While {{the slave trade}} during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions {{are far more likely}} to be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough that it would have been acquired through everyday personal interaction. The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew. There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. <b>Multilingualism</b> is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 2001, Orban {{served as}} a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was {{responsible}} for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for <b>Multilingualism</b> for Romania in the Barroso commission. He wrote numerous newspaper articles and analyses and gave several speeches on European affairs.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{example of}} <b>multilingualism</b> {{as well as}} multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically {{in the manner of}} Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.|$|E
5|$|The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War {{that started}} in 1975 and the Iranian {{revolution}} of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled <b>multilingualism,</b> while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. This wave of newcomers revitalized the Armenian American community, especially in the Los Angeles area, where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled. In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000. Although the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest {{in other parts of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} <b>multilingualism</b> {{have been studied}} {{in the field of}} neurology. These include the {{representation}} of different language systems in the brain, the effects of <b>multilingualism</b> on the brain's structural plasticity, aphasia in multilingual individuals, and bimodal bilinguals (people who can speak one sign language and one oral language). Neurological studies of <b>multilingualism</b> are carried out with functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and through observation of people who have suffered brain damage.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the growth}} of <b>multilingualism</b> in {{different}} parts of the world, there are controversies on the positive and negative impacts of bilingualism on the education of children. Studies have brought part of the answer to frequent questions such as: are bilingual children distressed? Does <b>multilingualism</b> make children smarter? Defenders of <b>multilingualism</b> assert that speaking another language contributes to an intelligent and healthy brain whereas opponents of <b>multilingualism</b> vehemently insist that speaking another language does not make children smarter and that on the contrary, it can disturb their learning journey. Researcher Ellen Bialystok examined the effect of <b>multilingualism</b> on Alzheimer's disease and found that it delays its onset by about 4 years. The researcher's study found that those who spoke two or more languages showed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at a later time than speakers of a single language. Interestingly, the study found that the more languages the multilingual knows, the later the onset of Alzheimer's disease. <b>Multilingualism</b> aids in the building up of cognitive reserves in the brain; these cognitive reserves force the brain to work harder—they, themselves, restructure the brain. <b>Multilingualism</b> leads to greater efficiency of use in the brain, and organizes the brain to be more efficient and conservative in using energy. More research is required to determine whether learning another language later in life has the same protective effects; nonetheless, it is evident from the variety of studies performed on the effects of <b>multilingualism</b> and bilingualism on the brain, that learning and knowing multiple languages sets the stage for a cognitive healthy life.|$|E

25|$|Invisible <b>multilingualism.</b> Place-names {{which only}} survive in Old English form {{could have had}} Brittonic {{counterparts}} for long periods without those being recorded. For example, the Welsh name of York, Efrog, derives independently from the Roman Eboracum.|$|E
25|$|While {{statistical}} learning improves and strengthens <b>multilingualism,</b> {{it appears}} that the inverse is not true. In a study by Yim and Rudoy it was found that both monolingual and bilingual children perform statistical learning tasks equally well.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Babeș-Bolyai University {{introduced}} an educational system {{backed by the}} High Commissioner on National Minorities and based on multiculturalism and <b>multilingualism,</b> with three lines of study (Romanian, Hungarian and German) {{at all levels of}} academic degrees.|$|E
25|$|Today, the university's Language Policy {{promotes}} <b>multilingualism</b> as a {{means to}} increase equitable access for all students and staff. Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa are used in academic, administrative, professional and social contexts, and classes are offered in Afrikaans and English.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} evident signs of <b>multilingualism</b> in Singapore's {{linguistic}} landscape include danger/warning signs at construction sites, as well as road signs for tourist attractions.

25|$|<b>Multilingualism</b> and the {{protection}} of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today.

25|$|The new portfolios, {{as well as}} {{splitting}} {{home affairs}} from civil liberties, merges enlargement with the neighbourhood policy, creates a post for climate change and scraps or merges weak dossiers such as communication (which was also open to charges of propaganda) and <b>multilingualism.</b> There are still some weak posts however, such as humanitarian aid and institutional relations.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the National Geographic Channel {{reported}} that Kabul's population {{was composed of}} the following ethnic groups: 45% Tajik, 25% Hazara, 25% Pashtun, 2% Uzbek, 1% Baloch, 1% Turkmen, and 1% Afghan Hindu. Dari and Pashto language are widely used in the region although Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the lingua franca. <b>Multilingualism</b> is common throughout the area, particularly among the Pashtun people.|$|E
25|$|Tunisian Arabic {{is mostly}} intelligible to {{speakers}} of other Maghrebi dialects but {{is hard to}} understand or is unintelligible for speakers of Middle Eastern Arabic. <b>Multilingualism</b> within Tunisia and in the Tunisian diaspora makes it common for Tunisians to code-switch, mixing Tunisian with French, English, Standard Arabic or other languages in daily speech. Within some circles, Tunisian Arabic has thereby integrated new French and English words, notably in technical fields, or replaced old French and Italian loans with standard Arabic words.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{language}} {{policy is}} the responsibility of member states, EU institutions promote <b>multilingualism</b> among its citizens. English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being understood by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers. German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (spoken by 16% of the EU population.) More than a half (56%) of EU citizens is able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.|$|E
25|$|A greater {{density of}} grey {{matter in the}} {{inferior}} parietal cortex is present in multilingual individuals. It {{has been found that}} <b>multilingualism</b> affects the structure, and essentially, the cytoarchitecture of the brain. Learning multiple languages re-structures the brain and some researchers argue that it increases the brain's capacity for plasticity. Most of these differences in brain structures in multilinguals may be genetic at the core. Consensus is still muddled; it may be a mixture of both—experiential (acquiring languages during life) and genetic (predisposition to brain plasticity).|$|E
25|$|In this respect, Kalaw Lagaw Ya {{appears to}} be a classic case of shift, whereby {{speakers}} of one language, {{over a long period of}} time, retained <b>multilingualism</b> while taking over aspects of the target language. The Austronesian and Papuan overlay changed the originally Australian phonology and syntax profoundly. The contrast of Australian laminal nh/ny and lh/ly and apical n and l has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and s, z, t, d, o and òò have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, such that these 'foreign' sounds occur in such words.|$|E
25|$|Some {{organizations}} or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing {{a more inclusive}} language policy either via official <b>multilingualism,</b> or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as to intrude minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to {{discrimination on the basis}} of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom “to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.” Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Mother tongue : The first {{language}} learned by a person, {{which may or}} may not still be used by that individual in adulthood, is a basic measure of a population's language. However, with the high number of mixed francophone-anglophone marriages and the reality of <b>multilingualism</b> in Montreal, this description does not give a true linguistic portrait of Quebec. It is, however, still essential, for example in order to calculate the assimilation rate. Statistics Canada defines mother tongue as the {{first language}} learned in childhood and still spoken; it does not presuppose literacy in that or any language.|$|E
25|$|Romania {{originally}} proposed Senator Varujan Vosganian, however {{he quickly}} met with opposition from Socialists and the Commission itself {{due to his}} far right views and having no experience of the EU or profile outside Romania. That nomination was replaced by Leonard Orban who was given the portfolio of <b>Multilingualism,</b> previously part of Education, Training & Culture. This however was met a cool reception {{for being such a}} slim portfolio. PES Group leader Martin Schulz MEP suggested it should instead focus on ethnic minorities but this was rejected by Barroso. Orban was approved by Parliament with 595 votes in favour, 16 against and 29 abstentions.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a growing}} concern over the {{treatment}} of <b>multilingualism</b> in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized. Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several (native) languages. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity. Some states prefer incorporating different languages {{in order to help}} students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.|$|E
