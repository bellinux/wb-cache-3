25|$|He was the director, writer, producer, and {{production}} designer for Xenogenesis (1978). He then became an uncredited production assistant on Rock and Roll High School in 1979. While continuing to educate himself in filmmaking techniques, Cameron started {{working as a}} miniature <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> at Roger Corman Studios. Making rapidly produced, low-budget productions taught Cameron to work efficiently. He soon found employment as an art director in the sci-fi movie Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). He did special effects work design and direction on John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981), acted as production designer on Galaxy of Terror (1981), and consulted {{on the design of}} Android (1982).|$|E
25|$|Stanton's role in Manny's legal trio {{was as a}} researcher. Though he {{admitted}} that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win McCormick v. Manny for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began on September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and McCormick v. Manny, was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case {{found their way to}} the floor of Congress.|$|E
500|$|The Excelsior was a {{new design}} that ILM felt was a better {{rendition}} of a Federation starship—sleeker and more modern than the Enterprise. The art department created concept sketches to show to Paramount, and at an art director's urging <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> William George submitted another design, {{based on what he}} thought the Enterprise would look like if designed by the Japanese. Nimoy picked George's angular and simplified take for production. While in the film, the Excelsior is supposed to be larger than its predecessor, the physical model was [...] smaller than the Enterprise.|$|E

500|$|Star Trek was {{the first}} film ILM worked on using entirely digital ships. Enterprise was {{intended}} by Abrams to be a merging of its design in the series and the refitted version from the original film. Abrams had fond memories of the revelation of Enterprises refit in , because it {{was the first}} time the ship felt tangible and real to him. The iridescent pattern on the ship from The Motion Picture was maintained to give the ship depth, while <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> Roger Goodson also applied the [...] "Aztec" [...] pattern from The Next Generation. Goodson recalled Abrams also wanted to bring a [...] "hot rod" [...] aesthetic to the ship. Effects supervisor Roger Guyett wanted the ship to have more moving parts, which stemmed from his childhood dissatisfaction with the ship's design: The new Enterprises dish can expand and move, while the fins on its engines split slightly when they begin warping. Enterprise was originally redesigned by Ryan Church using features of the original, at [...] long, but was doubled in size to [...] long to make it seem [...] "grander", while the Romulan Narada is five miles long and several miles wide. The filmmakers had to simulate lens flares on the ships in keeping with the film's cinematography.|$|E
2500|$|The show's vehicles, {{including}} the Eagle space shuttle and the , were represented {{with a mixture}} of full-sized props, photographic blow-ups, and detailed scale models.

2500|$|Cursor {{started making}} ultra {{detailed}} 1:40 scale plastic replicas of 1880-1920 era Mercedes-Benzes and Daimlers about 1969. The first models were produced by <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> Wiking and then immediately {{taken over by}} Cursor (Force 1990, 122). Models produced (sometimes marked with the initials C.R.) were mostly of vehicles on exhibit at the Mercedes-Benz museum, like the 1886 [...] "Dreirad" [...] three-wheeler and Daimler's gas powered horse-buggy style [...] "Motorwagen" [...] of the same year. These were the first gas powered vehicles ever produced. Also made were an 1895 Erster Benz omnibus and an 1896 firewagon, and a 1904 MAN Bussing omnibus (Sinclair's 1977). David Sinclair, an influential dealer to the diecast collecting hobby, imported {{some of the first}} Cursor Models to the United States in the mid-1970s; previous to this they were unknown in the United States (Levine 2009).|$|E

5000|$|Mock-ups are {{generally}} used {{as part of}} the design process to help convey each new iteration. Some <b>model</b> <b>makers</b> specialize in [...] "scale models" [...] that allow an easier grasp of the whole design or for portability of the model to a trade show or an architect or client's office. Other scale models are used in museum displays and in the movie special effects industry. <b>Model</b> <b>makers</b> work in many environments from private studio/shops to corporate design and engineering facilities to research laboratories.|$|R
50|$|The {{scale models}} {{construction}} process includes several stages. At first, the architectural {{drawings of the}} building or monument are used to create new drawings at a scale 1:33 {{in the case of}} Barcelona city and 1:25 for the other buildings. The precision demanded by <b>model</b> <b>makers</b> requires highly accurate drawings as well as detailed photographs. After that, the <b>model</b> <b>makers</b> start working on the structure that will hold up the model. Doors and windows are created using silicon moulds where polyurethane is injected to obtain the desired shape.|$|R
2500|$|ArcGIS 9 was {{released}} in May 2004, which included ArcGIS Server and ArcGIS Engine for developers. The ArcGIS 9 release includes a geoprocessing environment that allows execution of traditional GIS processing tools (such as clipping, overlay, and spatial analysis) interactively or from any scripting language that supports COM standards. [...] Although {{the most popular of}} these is Python, others have been used, especially Perl and VBScript. [...] ArcGIS 9 includes a visual programming environment, similar to ERDAS IMAGINE's <b>Model</b> <b>Maker</b> (released in 1994, v8.0.2). The Esri version is called ModelBuilder and as does the ERDAS IMAGINE version allows users to graphically link geoprocessing tools into new tools called models. [...] These models can be executed directly or exported to scripting languages which can then execute in batch mode (launched from a command line), or they can undergo further editing to add branching or looping.|$|E
2500|$|On most Jo-Han models, {{especially}} on friction models, chassis detail was often absent - which lowered tooling expense {{for a company}} not quite so large as AMT or the later MPC. Commonly, the chassis base was just an indented slab with the Jo-Han company name and [...] "Detroit, Michigan", but sometimes the company name was completely absent and only the GM or other car logo was present - emphasizing the real manufacturer instead of Jo-Han, the <b>model</b> <b>maker.</b> Some later contracts, however, added complete chassis detail {{as seen in the}} 1970 Ford Maverick, and the Cadillac Coupe DeVille and Eldorado promotionals from the later 1970s. On the 1965 and 1966 full sized Chrysler promos, Jo-Han outdid themselves by offering working torsion bars, but these were dropped for 1967 [...] Apart from the often plain chassis, models were exact duplicates of the real thing in 1/25 scale. Wheels also carried accurate detail, including authentic and official logos and scripts in hubcap centers.|$|E
2500|$|Partly out of {{fear for}} the Tolkien tourism effect, on 25 October 2010, {{thousands}} of New Zealanders organised protest rallies imploring that production remain in New Zealand, arguing that shifting production to locations outside New Zealand would potentially cost the country's economy up to $1.5billion. After two days of talks with the New Zealand government (including involvement by Prime Minister John Key), Warner Bros. executives decided on 27 October to film The Hobbit in New Zealand as originally planned. In return, the government agreed to introduce legislation to remove the right of workers to organise trade unions in the film production industry, and to give money to big budget films made in New Zealand. The legislation reversed {{a decision by the}} New Zealand Supreme Court called Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd holding that under the Employment Relations Act 2000, a <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> named Mr Bryson was an [...] "employee" [...] who could organise a union to defend his interests. The Employment Relations (Film Production Work) Amendment Bill passed all three readings under urgency on 29 October 2010, 66 votes in favour to 50 opposed. The government's legislation has been criticised as breaching the International Labour Organization's core ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association, and giving an unfair subsidy to protect multinational business interests.|$|E

2500|$|The grave {{design process}} was placed under tight secrecy. An {{extensive}} research project {{was conducted in}} which hundreds of famous tombs (such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and Grant's Tomb) {{as well as all}} existing presidential burial sites. Warnecke discussed design concepts with more than 40 architects, sculptors, painters, landscape architects, stonemasons, calligraphers, and liturgical experts—including the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, architectural <b>model</b> <b>maker</b> Theodore Conrad, and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Noguchi counseled Warnecke to add a large sculptural cross to the site and to eliminate the eternal flame (which he felt was kitschy). Warnecke consulted with Mrs. Kennedy about the design of the grave many times over the following year. Hundreds of architectural drawings and models were produced to explore design ideas. On April 6, 1964, Warnecke sent a memorandum to Mrs. Kennedy in which he outlined his desire to retain the eternal flame as the centerpiece of the burial site and to keep the site's design as simple as possible. In the course of the research and conceptualization effort, Warnecke considered the appropriateness of structures or memorials at the site (such as crosses, shafts, pavilions, etc.), the history of Arlington National Cemetery, the vista, and how to handle ceremonies at the site. By August 1964, Warnecke and his assistants had written a 76-page research report which concluded that the gravesite was not a memorial nor monument, but a grave. [...] "This particular hillside, this flame, this man and this point in history must be synthesized in one statement that has distinctive character of its own. We must avoid adding elements that in later decades might become superficial and detract from the deeds of the man," [...] Warnecke wrote For some time {{in the spring and summer}} of 1964, the design process appeared to slow as Warnecke and his associates struggled to design the actual graves. But in the summer of 1964 Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy's brother-in-law, forcefully told Warnecke that [...] "There must be something there when we get there." [...] This spurred the design effort forward. In the late summer and early fall, Warnecke considered massive headstones, a sarcophagus, a sunken tomb, a raised tomb, and sculpture to mark the graves. Very late in the design process, two abstract sculptures were designed but ultimately rejected.|$|E
