40|$|Objectives & Study: Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) {{remains one}} of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in premature neonates 1. Modification of immune response and alteration of epithelial barrier {{play a crucial role in}} the pathogenesis of NEC. Zinc is an ubiquitous element deeply involved in the development of immune response and essential for epithelial integrity. Preterm neonates are at high risk of zinc deficiency 2. In this study we aimed to investigate the efficacy of zinc supplementation in reducing the occurrence of NEC in preterm neonates. Methods: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted on very low birth weight neonates (birth weight < 1500 g), randomly allocated, at the 7 th day of life, in zinc group (receiving 10 mg/d of zinc through a <b>multivitamin</b> <b>product</b> given by oral route) or in placebo group (receiving a similar <b>multivitamin</b> <b>product</b> without zinc).

40|$|I T is {{generally}} accepted that a supplementary {{source of vitamin}} C should {{be added to the}} diets of bottle-fed infants;” 2 25 to 30 mg. per day is the recommended quantity for this purpose. ’ This supplementation usually is given in the form of orange juice, either freshly squeezed, canned, as reconstituted frozen con-centrate, or as a <b>multivitamin</b> <b>product.</b> In view of the desirability of supplying a continuous, adequate amount of vitamin C to infants, reports on the vitamin content of oranges were reviewed. A considerable varia-tion in this content was noted. Holmes et al. 3 found a range of from 27 to 67 mg. of ascorbic acid per 100 cc. of orange juice, and further reported that forty-four samples of juice gave twenty-six different values.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although complex <b>multivitamin</b> <b>products</b> {{are widely}} used as dietary {{supplements}} to maintain health or as special medical food in certain diseases, {{the effects of these}} products were not investigated in hyperlipidemia which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, here we investigated if a preparation developed for human use containing different vitamins, minerals and trace elements enriched with phytosterol (VMTP) affects the severity of experimental hyperlipidemia as well as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed a normal or cholesterol-enriched (2 % cholesterol + 0. 25 % cholate) diet for 12 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia. From week 8, rats in both groups were fed with a VMTP preparation or placebo for 4 weeks. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured at week 0, 8 and 12. At week 12, hearts were isolated, perfused according to Langendorff and subjected to a 30 -min coronary occlusion followed by 120 min reperfusion to measure infarct size. RESULTS: At week 8, cholesterol-fed rats showed significantly higher serum cholesterol level as compared to normal animals, however, serum triglyceride level did not change. VMTP treatment significantly decreased serum cholesterol level in the hyperlipidemic group by week 12 without affecting triglyceride levels. However, VMTP did not show beneficial effect on infarct size. The inflammatory marker hs-CRP and the antioxidant uric acid were also not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that treatment of hyperlipidemic subjects with a VMTP preparation reduces serum cholesterol, the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, it does not provide cardioprotection...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} how much vitamin A is consumed through liver and liver products by non-pregnant and pregnant women aged 16 - 50 years, and to determine the implications {{for the use of}} <b>multivitamin</b> <b>products.</b> Design. Secondary analysis on data from representative database Dutch National Food Consumption Survey. Method. Data were obtained from a Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (1992, method published earlier) regarding 1725 non-pregnant and 58 pregnant women aged 16 - 50 years who did or did not consume liver and (or) liver products. Results. Average daily vitamin A intake (two consecutive days), was 850 retinol equivalents (RE) for non-pregnant and 990 RE for pregnant women, respectively (recommended daily allowances are 800 RE and 1000 RE). Average intakes of those not eating liver or liver products were 540 RE and 720 RE per day. In about 70 % and 50 % of the women respectively the intake was below the minimal requirement of 6 oo RE per day. The use of a vitamin A supplement providing 1200 RE per day among the non-liver users would in none of the cases have resulted in intakes higher than the threshold level of 7500 RE for teratogenic risks. Occasionally in 2 - 3 % of the women, not using liver or liver products, maximum intake would exceed 5000 RE per day (the upper safe limit of intake according to the Dutch Health Council/Nutrition Council Committee). However, women using liver or liver products would be at risk of having too high intakes, above the treshold level of 7500 RE, irrespective of the use of vitamin supplements. Conclusion. Regular vitamin A supplements may be safely used by pregnant women who consume little or no liver or 1 iver products. Chemicals/CAS: Teratogens; Vitamin A, 11103 - 57 -...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although <b>multivitamin</b> <b>products</b> {{are widely}} used as dietary {{supplements}} to maintain health or as special medical food in certain diseases, {{the effects of these}} products were not investigated in diabetes mellitus, a major cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, here we investigated if a preparation of different minerals, vitamins, and trace elements (MVT) for human use affects the severity of experimental diabetes. METHODS: Two days old neonatal Wistar rats from both genders were injected with 100 mg/kg of streptozotocin or its vehicle to induce diabetes. At week 4, rats were fed with an MVT preparation or vehicle for 8 weeks. Well established diagnostic parameters of diabetes, i. e. fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test were performed at week 4, 8 and 12. Moreover, serum insulin and blood HbA 1 c were measured at week 12. RESULTS: An impaired glucose tolerance has been found in streptozotocin-treated rats in both genders at week 4. In males, fasting blood glucose and HbA 1 c were significantly increased and glucose tolerance and serum insulin was decreased at week 12 in the vehicle-treated diabetic group as compared to the vehicle-treated non-diabetic group. All of the diagnostic parameters of diabetes were significantly improved by MVT treatment in male rats. In females, streptozotocin treatment resulted in a less severe prediabetic-like phenotype as only glucose tolerance and HbA 1 c were altered {{by the end of the}} study in the vehicle-treated diabetic group as compared to the vehicle-treated non-diabetic group. MVT treatment failed to improve the diagnostic parameters of diabetes in female streptozotocin-treated rats. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that MVT significantly attenuates the progression of diabetes in male rats with chronic experimental diabetes. Moreover, we have confirmed that females are less sensitive to STZ-induced diabetes and MVT preparation did not show protection against prediabetic state. This may suggest a gender difference in the pathogenesis of diabetes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetic {{patients}} {{have an increased}} risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which are {{the leading cause of death}} in developed countries. Although <b>multivitamin</b> <b>products</b> are widely used as dietary supplements, the effects of these products have not been investigated in the diabetic heart yet. Therefore, here we investigated if a preparation of different minerals, vitamins, and trace elements (MVT) affects the cardiac gene expression pattern in experimental diabetes. METHODS: Two-day old male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (i. p. 100 mg/kg) or citrate buffer to induce diabetes. From weeks 4 to 12, rats were fed with a vehicle or a MVT preparation. Fasting blood glucose measurement and oral glucose tolerance test were performed at week 12, and then total RNA was isolated from the myocardium and assayed by rat oligonucleotide microarray for 41012 oligonucleotides. RESULTS: Significantly elevated fasting blood glucose concentration and impaired glucose tolerance were markedly improved by MVT-treatment in diabetic rats at week 12. Genes with significantly altered expression due to diabetes include functional clusters related to cardiac hypertrophy (e. g. caspase recruitment domain family, member 9; cytochrome P 450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide; FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 3), stress response (e. g. metallothionein 1 a; metallothionein 2 a; interleukin- 6 receptor; heme oxygenase (decycling) 1; and glutathione S-transferase, theta 3), and hormones associated with insulin resistance (e. g. resistin; FK 506 binding protein 5; galanin/GMAP prepropeptide). Moreover the expression of some other genes with no definite cardiac function was also changed such as e. g. similar to apolipoprotein L 2; brain expressed X-linked 1; prostaglandin b 2 synthase (brain). MVT-treatment in diabetic rats showed opposite gene expression changes in the cases of 19 genes associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. In healthy hearts, MVT-treatment resulted in cardiac gene expression changes mostly related to immune response (e. g. complement factor B; complement component 4 a; interferon regulatory factor 7; hepcidin). CONCLUSIONS: MVT-treatment improved diagnostic markers of diabetes. This is the first demonstration that MVT-treatment significantly alters cardiac gene expression profile in both control and diabetic rats. Our results and further studies exploring the mechanistic role of individual genes may contribute to the prevention or diagnosis of cardiac complications in diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} of biotin occurs via a Na+-dependent carrier-mediated process {{that involves the}} sodium-dependent <b>multivitamin</b> transporter (SMVT; <b>product</b> of the Slc 5 a 6 gene). The SMVT system is exclusively expressed at the apical membrane domain of the polarized intestinal epithelial cells. Whereas previous studies from our laboratory and others have characterized different physiological and biological aspects of SMVT, little is currently known about its structure-function activity relationship. Using site-directed mutagenesis approach, we examined {{the role of the}} positively charged histidine (His) residues of the human SMVT (hSMVT) in transporting the negatively charged biotin. Of the seven conserved (across species) His residues in the hSMVT polypeptide, only His 115 and His 254 were found to be important for the function of hSMVT as their mutation led to a significant reduction in carrier-mediated biotin uptake. This inhibition was mediated via a significant reduction in the maximal velocity (Vmax), but not the apparent Michaelis constant (Km), of the biotin uptake process and was not related to the charge of the His residue. The inhibition was also not due to changes in transcriptional or translational efficiency of the mutated hSMVT compared with wild-type carrier. However, surface biotinylation assay showed a significant reduction in the level of expression of the mutated hSMVT at the cell surface, a finding that was further confirmed by confocal imaging. Our results show important role for His 115 and His 254 residues in hSMVT function, which is most probably mediated via an effect on level of hSMVT expression at the cell membrane...|$|R
