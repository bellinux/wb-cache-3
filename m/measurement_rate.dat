40|$|Traditional {{algorithms}} for compressive sensing recovery are computationally {{expensive and}} are ineffective at low <b>measurement</b> <b>rates.</b> In this work, we propose a data driven non-iterative algorithm {{to overcome the}} shortcomings of earlier iterative algorithms. Our solution, ReconNet, is a deep neural network, whose parameters are learned end-to-end to map block-wise compressive measurements of the scene to the desired image blocks. Reconstruction of an image becomes a simple forward pass through the network and {{can be done in}} real-time. We show empirically that our algorithm yields reconstructions with higher PSNRs compared to iterative algorithms at low <b>measurement</b> <b>rates</b> and in presence of measurement noise. We also propose a variant of ReconNet which uses adversarial loss in order to further improve reconstruction quality. We discuss how adding a fully connected layer to the existing ReconNet architecture allows for jointly learning the measurement matrix and the reconstruction algorithm in a single network. Experiments on real data obtained from a block compressive imager show that our networks are robust to unseen sensor noise. Finally, through an experiment in object tracking, we show that even at very low <b>measurement</b> <b>rates,</b> reconstructions using our algorithm possess rich semantic content {{that can be used for}} high level inference...|$|R

40|$|The <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> {{of cameras}} that take {{spatially}} multiplexed measurements by using spatial light mod-ulators (SLM) is often {{limited by the}} switching speed of the SLMs. This {{is especially true for}} single-pixel cameras where the photodetector operates at a rate that is many orders-of-magnitude greater than the SLM. We study the factors that determine the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> for such spatial multiplexing cameras (SMC) and show that increasing the number of pixels in the de-vice improves the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate,</b> but there is an opti-mum number of pixels (typically, few thousands) beyond which the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> does not increase. This mo-tivates the design of LiSens, a novel imaging architec-ture, that replaces the photodetector in the single-pixel camera with a 1 D linear array or a line-sensor. We illus-trate the optical architecture underlying LiSens, build a prototype, and demonstrate results of a range of indoor and outdoor scenes. LiSens delivers on the promise of SMCs: imaging at a megapixel resolution, at video rate, using an inexpensive low-resolution sensor. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{define the}} hitting (or absorbing) {{time for the}} case of {{continuous}} quantum walks by measuring the walk at random times, according to a Poisson process with <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> λ. From this definition we derive an explicit formula for the hitting time, and explore its dependence on the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate.</b> As the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> goes to either 0 or infinity the hitting time diverges; the first divergence reflects {{the weakness of the}} measurement, while the second limit results from the Quantum Zeno effect.

Two hundred and ninety-six eyes of 170 patients with cataract were enrolled. Cataract type and severity were graded using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) and AL measurements were attempted with IOLMaster (version 5. 4) and Lenstar LS 900 (version 1. 1). Chi-squared {{analysis was used}} to assess if the difference in AL <b>measurement</b> acquisition <b>rate</b> was statistically significant between the two devices. The association of the different cataract types and severity with the AL <b>measurement</b> acquisition <b>rate</b> was evaluated with logistic regression analysis. AL measurements were obtained in 184 eyes (62. 16 %) using the IOLMaster and 191 eyes (64. 53 %) using the Lenstar, which corresponds to a failure rate of 37. 84 % and 35. 47 % respectively.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} relationship between two relevant quantities in compressive sensing: the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate,</b> which characterizes the asymptotic {{behavior of the}} dimensions of the measurement matrix in terms of the ratio m/ log n (m being the number of measurements and n the dimension of the sparse signal), and the mean square estimation error. First, we use an information-theoretic approach to derive sufficient conditions on the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> to reliably recover a part of the support set that represents a certain fraction of the total signal power when the sparsity level is fixed. Second, we characterize the mean square error of an estimator that uses partial support set information. Using these two parts, we derive a tradeoff between the <b>measurement</b> <b>rate</b> and the mean square error. This tradeoff is achievable using a two-step approach: first support set recovery, then estimation of the active components.
