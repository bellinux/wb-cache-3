Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among <b>merit</b> <b>pay</b> employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the <b>merit</b> <b>pay</b> system.

25|$|The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 {{created the}} Office of Personal Management, {{to oversee the}} human {{resource}} management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, <b>merit</b> <b>pay</b> {{on a variety of}} levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers. This <b>merit</b> <b>pay</b> system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others would of necessity be receive less than in the previous system.|$|E
40|$|A {{purpose of}} this paper is to detect {{relations}} between planning systems and rewarding schemes in micro-, small-, medium- and large-sized companies. The conducted analysis is based on selected data from a research project focusing on planning, control and communication practices developed by enterprises operating in Poland. The paper reflects information and opinions included in 397 research forms. The empirical results provided evidence on positive and statistically relevant relationship between character of a goal-setting process and reward strategies. It seems that participative as well as formalized planning, where employees take part in setting objectives or obtain plans with defined goals induces performance-based reward strategies, which are reflected in <b>merit</b> <b>pays</b> or bonuses contingent on individual or corporate performance. Likewise also managerial feedback affects in a positive manner reward strategy. The study suggests that there is statistically relevant difference in reward strategies considering sector affiliation...|$|R

He sponsored the Education A-Plus bill in 1997 and again in 1999, which would have allowed parents to open tax-free savings accounts for their children's school expenses, such as tutoring, computers and books. McCain co-sponsored the Child Nutrition Act, which would provide federal funding for at-risk children. He said when running for president in 2000 {{that he would take}} $5.4 billion away from sugar, gas and ethanol subsidies and pour that money into a test voucher program for every poor school district in America. He voted against diverting $51.9 million away from the Department of Labor and putting it towards after-school community learning centers, and he voted against an amendment which would fund smaller class sizes rather than providing funds for private tutors.|$|E

The three met with Putnam on December 13, who attempted to determine what the employers' bargaining position was. Although Putnam ruled out price relief based on a rise in wages, {{for the first time}} he and OPS director DiSalle indicated that the government would permit the steel manufacturers to seek the maximum price increase allowed by the Capehart Amendment. Cyrus Ching, now head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, sent two of his top aides to meet with union officials to determine the union's bargaining strategy and timeline. The aides met with Murray and the union's collective bargaining committee on December 14, but made no headway.

On December 8, Feinsinger told the press that the Board was already working on a revision to the regulation which would permit <b>merit</b> <b>pay</b> increases. Five days later, Feinsinger let it be known that a number of economic issues (such as increased pension contributions) might be removed from the calculation of the basic wage rate in order to relieve the pressure on the negotiating parties.|$|E
