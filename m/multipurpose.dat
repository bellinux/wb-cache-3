The campus also has its own power plant, laundry service, incinerator, and Amtrak train station.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} project was {{initially}} built for hydroelectric power generation to meet the mining requirements, it has over the years evolved into a <b>multipurpose</b> reservoir with benefits of power generation, drinking water and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} a <b>multipurpose</b> horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a type of carriage). Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such as the one in existence for the Mérens horse, once the need for a <b>multipurpose</b> breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and the breed almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved the breed from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for the breed in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Cardiff Bay Opera House scheme, a new project, the Wales Millennium Centre, met with more success. The necessary consents and funding were obtained, and work began in 2002 on a new <b>multipurpose</b> arts centre on the Cardiff Bay site. The centre included a 1,900-seat theatre, which, among other uses, became WNO's home base from 2004, with its own rehearsal space and offices in the complex.|$|E

The <b>multipurpose</b> utility hall (Samanjasya) hosts most of the cultural activities on the campus.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a new park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a <b>multipurpose</b> development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E

The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and <b>multipurpose</b> missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|Citibase Brighton (previously {{known as}} The Brighton Forum by Topcentre) {{is a complex}} of {{serviced}} offices on a prominent elevated position in the Round Hill area of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. The large Gothic Revival building, by two architect brothers from London, has had three greatly different uses since its construction {{at the edge of}} Brighton parish in 1854: for its first 85 years, it trained Anglican schoolmistresses; then it became a military base and records office; and in 1988 it opened as a <b>multipurpose</b> business centre and office complex. The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style, especially around the windows. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.|$|E
5|$|Florida Atlantic {{completed}} an $18.6 million Recreation and Wellness Center in spring 2010. The facility houses an outdoor leisure and lap pool, a cardio equipment and free weight room, two <b>multipurpose</b> rooms, three indoor courts and health club-style locker rooms. In 2011, the facility won the NIRSA Outstanding Sports Facilities Award.

5|$|In March 1997, {{the city}} passed Measure B, which granted the school {{district}} $69 million to replace old and crowded facilities and modernize the school campus. The renovations revived one of the school's last original structures: the Amador Theater, the city's most popular performing arts facility. The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a <b>multipurpose</b> room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building. The parking lot and central quad were expanded, with more than 550 parking spaces in the new lot, and classrooms were equipped to be more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{former and}} current venues in 11 urban areas have hosted Belgium's home games. Most of these matches have been played in Brussels at the Heysel Plateau, {{on the site}} of the present-day King Baudouin Stadium—a <b>multipurpose</b> {{facility}} with a seating capacity of 50,122. Its field also hosts the team's final trainings before domestic games. Since 2007, most physical preparation takes place at the National Football Centre in Tubize, or at Anderlecht's training ground in the Neerpede quarter. Apart from Belgian home friendlies, at the international level Belgium's national stadium has also hosted six European Championship games.|$|E
5|$|The Students' Building on {{the campus}} of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York, U.S., houses the school's All Campus Dining Center (ACDC or Deece) as well as {{additional}} multifunctional student space on its second floor. Designed by Joseph Herenden Clark of McKim, Mead & White and built in 1913, the structure originally housed a variety of different student organizations and school functions. In 1973, it was converted into a campuswide dining hall; it underwent a second renovation in 2003 that returned <b>multipurpose</b> student functionalities to its upper floors.|$|E
5|$|This {{deficiency}} {{was addressed}} by procuring further German Bf 109 and French Morane D-3800fighters. In 1942, the Swiss-built F+W C-36 <b>multipurpose</b> aircraft was introduced into service, and in 1943, Switzerland opened its own aircraft factory, Flugzeugwerk Emmen. Caverns {{were built in}} which to shelter aircraft and maintenance personnel from air attack, for example in Alpnach, Meiringen and Turtmann. In 1942-43, an air gunnery range at Ebenfluh-Axalp was opened for training. The Surveillance Squadron (Überwachungsgeschwader) was formed in 1941 and made combat-ready in 1943. A night fighter squadron was formed for evaluation purposes in 1944 and disbanded in 1950.|$|E
5|$|A new four-lane Gunningsville Bridge {{was opened}} in 2005, {{connecting}} downtown Riverview directly with downtown Moncton. On the Moncton side, the bridge connects with {{an extension of}} Vaughan Harvey Boulevard {{as well as to}} Assumption Boulevard and will serve as a catalyst for economic growth in the downtown area. This has become already evident as an expansion to the Blue Cross Centre was completed in 2006 and a Marriott Residence Inn opened in 2008. The new regional law courts on Assumption Blvd opened in 2011. Construction has begun on a new downtown 8,500 seat <b>multipurpose</b> events centre and arena {{on the site of the}} former Highfield Square shopping centre. This arena will open in 2018. On the Riverview side, the Gunningsville Bridge now connects to a new ring road around the town and is expected to serve as a catalyst for development in east Riverview.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in {{a closely}} contested election, {{he was elected}} President of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee {{defeating}} N G Ranga. When the Andhra State was formed in 1953, T. Prakasam became its Chief Minister and Reddy became the deputy. After the later formation of the Andhra Pradesh state by incorporating Telangana with the Andhra State, Reddy became its first Chief Minister from 1 November 1956 to 11 January 1960. He was Chief Minister {{for a second time}} from 12 March 1962 to 20 February 1964, thus holding that office for over five years. Reddy was MLA from Sri Kalahasti and Dhone respectively during his stints as Chief Minister. The Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam <b>multipurpose</b> river valley projects were initiated during his tenure. The Government of Andhra Pradesh later renamed the Srisailam project to Neelam Sanjiva Reddy Sagar in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler <b>multipurpose</b> subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonnais {{probably}} descends {{from the}} horses {{that inspired the}} Magdalenian-era paintings found, for example, at the Cave of Niaux, with Oriental and Iberian blood added later. Originally bred as a <b>multipurpose</b> breed used for cavalry, agriculture and driving, the breed declined in population during the 20th century, and almost became extinct. In 1980, a group of supporters began to work to save the breed, and a breed association, now called the Association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP), was formed in 1992. The breed was officially recognized by the French Ministry of Agriculture in 1996. The French government, breed association and a regional conservation group all now share {{an interest in the}} preservation of the breed. Population numbers are still quite low, and inbreeding is a concern.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais or Charollais is an extinct {{breed of}} warmblood horse from the Charolais region of France {{surrounding}} {{the town of}} Charolles, now in the Saône-et-Loire department of Burgundy, in eastern central France. Like other French warmbloods, it {{was the result of}} crossing local agricultural horses with the Thoroughbred, and was known by the name of the region in which it was bred. The Charolais never had a breed-specific studbook. The Charolais and other French warmblood breeds were fused in 1958 to create the national warmblood studbook for a unified breed, the Selle Français. It was originally used as a <b>multipurpose</b> horse for riding, driving, and agriculture. During the late 19th century, additional Thoroughbred blood was added and a new type emerged that was principally used as a light cavalry mount. It was also used for dressage and show jumping.|$|E
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer was {{originally}} bred as a <b>multipurpose</b> farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} or over 200,000 and a size of 39,890 hectares, it comprises {{a substantial part}} of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district. Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times. The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include Manir and Batu Rakit. Among major education institutions located in this district are Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, The Institute of Teacher Education Dato Razali Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute. The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) Teaching Hospital is now under construction, thus providing this district with a new establishment. The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district, as is the <b>multipurpose</b> Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own, since both of them are under the administration of the same local government, this makes MBKT among the few local governments in Malaysia to manage two different districts.|$|E

In 2002, concerns were raised that <b>multipurpose</b> {{solutions are}} not effective at disinfecting Acanthamoeba from the lens. In May 2007, one brand of <b>multipurpose</b> solution was recalled due to a cluster of Acanthamoeba infections. Since then, studies showed that <b>multipurpose</b> solutions are ineffective against Acanthamoebae. The latest <b>multipurpose</b> solutions also contain ingredients that improve the surface wetability and comfort of silicone hydrogel lenses.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the older}} Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers, Botnica was {{chartered}} to DSND Offshore AS for 180 days per year, {{while in the}} winter months she was employed as a traditional escort icebreaker in the Baltic Sea. Once icebreaker assistance was no longer needed, the offshore construction equipment was re-installed and the vessel left the Baltic Sea for the summer season. In 2002 Halliburton Offshore and DSND combined their resources and {{the charter of the}} <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers was transferred to the new company, Subsea 7. Until 2004 the company had the exclusive rights to charter the Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers.|$|E

The ship, delivered in 1998 as Botnica, was slightly {{smaller than the}} previous Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers and had several other differences, such as twelve Caterpillar high-speed diesel engines instead of medium-speed units and Azipod electric azimuth thrusters instead of the ducted Z-drive Aquamasters. In 2012, Botnica was sold to Port of Tallinn, Estonia.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2004, the ownership {{and management of the}} state-owned vessels was transferred to a newly founded state-owned enterprise, Finstaship. Later a separate company, GDV Maritime AS, was established together with Norwegian partners and handled the global marketing of the Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers until 2008. During this time, the focal point in the marketing of the Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers shifted more to offshore activities and the ships returned to their home waters only if they were needed for icebreaking. In 2006, Fennica was the only Finnish <b>multipurpose</b> icebreaker to escort merchant ships in the Finnish waters during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|When Fennica entered {{service in}} 1993, {{it was agreed}} that the <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers would be {{chartered}} for offshore duties about 180 days per year during the ice-free season. For the winter months, they would return to Finland for escort icebreaking duties in the Baltic Sea or, if {{there was no need to}} deploy the whole state-owned icebreaker fleet during particularly mild winters, for lay-up in a Finnish port. The exclusive right to charter the <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers was given to Ugland Offshore AS and later DSND Offshore AS. In 2002, Halliburton Offshore and DSND combined their resources and the exclusive charter of the <b>multipurpose</b> icebreakers was transferred to the new company, Subsea 7, that held it until 2004.|$|E
