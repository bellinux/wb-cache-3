By detecting interaction qualities such as rapport, we can better sup-port collaborative interactions, which {{have been shown to be}} highly conducive to learning. For this, we focus on one particular phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> conversation, known as acoustic-prosodic entrainment, where dialogue partners be-come more similar to each other in their pitch, loudness, or speaking rate during the course of a conversation. We examine whether acoustic-prosodic entrainment is present in a novel corpus of collaborative learning dialogues, how people appear to entrain, to what degree, and report on the acoustic-prosodic features which people entrain on the most. We then investigate whether entrainment can facili-tate detection of rapport, a social quality of the interaction. We find that entrainment does correlate to rapport; speak-ers appear to entrain primarily by matching their prosody on a turn-by-turn basis, and pitch is the most significant acoustic-prosodic feature people entrain on when rapport is present...|$|R

He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People's/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting. Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism. Despite these criticisms, Morton's anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana.

Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw [...] "the arc of the character" [...] had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions.

Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation. The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for American Gangster.

500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E

40|$|To clarify how {{the brain}} understands the speaker's mind for verbal acts, fMRI images {{obtained}} from 24 subjects and behavioral data obtained from 339 subjects were analyzed when they judged the linguistic meanings or emotional <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> phrases. The target phrases had linguistically positive or negative meanings and were uttered warmheartedly or coldheartedly by a woman speaker. The results of the fMRI analyses suggest that neural resources responsible for the speakers' mind reading are distributed over the superior temporal sulci (STS), inferior frontal regions, medial frontal regions and posterior cerebellum. When compared to the female subjects, the male subjects showed significantly stronger activation only in the right frontomedian cortex, which can be hypothesized to infer the speaker's hidden but true intentions from the speaking acts. The correct judgment of the speaker's intentions significantly increased with age for the phrases with inconsistent linguistic and emotional valences. Female children showed faster development than male children. These results suggest that neural processes for language and emotional prosody significantly interact to mentalize verbal acts, and sex differences exist in this mind reading system話し言葉の言語的意味と感情的態度を判断する課題に対して 24 名から観測された機能的MRIによる脳機能画像と 339 名の課題成績を分析して,音声コミュニケーションにおいて話者の心を理解する脳機能を検討した。言語的意味が正負で対立するフレーズ(好きvs. 嫌い) を,感情的態度が対立するモード(「愛情」vs. 「憎しみ」) で女性話者 1 名が発話した音声を使用した。脳機能画像解析の結果,話者の心の理解には,左右上側頭溝,左右前頭葉下部,右前頭葉内側部,左右小脳後部などが関与することが示唆された。女性被験者に対して男性で有意に賦活レベルの高かった右前頭葉内側部は,話者の真意を推測する機能に関与すると考えられた。課題成績は,刺激の感情属性と言語属性が一致しないフレーズに対して小学生から中学生に渡って加齢とともに有意に上昇した。女児のほうが男児より発達が早いことも示された。これらの結果は,話者の心を理解する脳機能において,従来独立と仮定されてきた言語的情報処理と感情的情報処理とが相互に干渉し合うこと,この脳機能には性差があることを示唆する。原著Original Article国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R
