40|$|ABSTRACT: Five {{families}} of new controlled epoxy thermosets (CENs) using three mono-phenol chain terminators {{were prepared to}} study systematic changes in the structure and amount of the <b>monophenol</b> and the initial molecular weight between crosslinks (Mc,i) on the properties of epoxy thermosets. Glass transition temperature (Tg) decreases with <b>monophenol</b> mole fraction (v) in proportion to both the concentration and flexibility of the chain terminator. Distinct serial relations for Tg depression were observed for the threeMc,i families. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows signifi-cant perturbations of the relaxation behavior with added terminator as evidenced by decrease in peak tan d and in post Tg damping. The rubbery coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) increases with <b>monophenol</b> concentration only at v> 0. 05 and shows distinct curvature versus temperature, but is largely invariant with <b>monophenol</b> flexi-bility.

40|$|<b>Monophenols</b> {{are present}} in {{a broad range of}} foods and beverages, where they often act as {{important}} contributors to the flavour of these products. They are usually plant-derived, thus with barley malt as one of the main raw materials, beer contains a variety of phenolic compounds, including <b>monophenols.</b> Several <b>monophenols</b> have been identified in beer many years ago, but did not gain much attention since. Nevertheless, certain spicy and vanilla-like flavour notes that are typically ascribed to <b>monophenols</b> can be noticed in some beers. Considering the flavour potential of <b>monophenols,</b> the objective of this research was to study their presence in beer, their origin, their formation and their effect on beer flavour. However, <b>monophenols</b> are hard to analyse because of their polar hydroxyl group, particularly in the complex beer medium. Therefore, the first step of this research consisted in developing a method for the quantification of <b>monophenols</b> in beer. <b>Monophenols</b> were acetylated and could subsequently be analysed with solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. This method was successfully validated, and ten out of 13 studied <b>monophenols</b> could be quantified in commercial and experimental beer samples. Furthermore, the flavour effect of <b>monophenols</b> was assessed in beer by determining their flavour thresholds. Next, their flavour units were calculated by dividing the monophenol concentrations through their respective flavour thresholds. Huge differences were observed between individual tasters, suggesting that flavour thresholds need to be considered indicative measures for the flavour impact rather than absolute. Additionally, flavour interactions between <b>monophenols</b> were demonstrated by determining the thresholds of 9 binary mixtures. <b>Monophenols</b> often showed strong and mostly positive flavour interactions, which enables them to influence flavour even at sub-threshold concentrations. Moreover, recombination experiments confirmed this joint influence on the overall beer flavour, as certain spicy and vanilla-like flavour notes could be perceived in the spiked beers. The impact of <b>monophenols</b> on beer flavour called for an investigation into their origin and formation during the brewing process. On that account, the monophenol content of several raw materials used in brewing was determined. In general, maize and rice flakes were particularly rich in <b>monophenols</b> and caramel and roasted malts showed a higher monophenol content than pilsner malt. The partial use of these raw materials, as compared to 100 % pilsner malt, can influence the monophenol content and thus could also influence the flavour of the resulting beers. During extraction under mashing conditions, the release of <b>monophenols</b> increased with increasing temperature, which indicates that some hydrolysis reaction might be responsible. Yet to identify the formation mechanisms and actual precursors of <b>monophenols</b> in the studied raw materials, further research is needed. As <b>monophenols</b> {{play a role in the}} wood aged flavour of wines andspirits, their evolution during the aging of beer on wood was investigated as well. Storage of beer on oak chips considerably increased both monophenol concentrations and typical wood aging flavour notes, such as woody, smoky, spicy and vanilla. The influence on beer flavour and the amount of extracted <b>monophenols</b> depended on many wood and process related parameters such as the toasting degree of the oak chips, the pH and ethanol content of the extraction medium, the storage temperature and the presence of yeast and oxygen. This research demonstrates that <b>monophenols</b> can influence beer flavour more than was previously assumed. Furthermore, some insights into the origin and formation of these flavour-active compounds were obtained. This information can help brewers to better control the monophenol content, and thus the flavour, of their beers or to develop new, innovative products. nrpages: 164 status: publishe...|$|E

The mechanisms for other pigmentation determinants (e. g., those operative in tyrosinase-positive albinism and in murine coat-color mutants) are not yet known. One murine pigmentation gene, the brown (b) locus, when mutated leads to a brown (b/b) or hypopigmented (Blt/Blt) coat versus the wild-type black (B/B).

In a proton inventory study of the oxidation of o-diphenols, the representation of kcat fn/kcat f 0 against n (atom fractions of deuterium), where kcat fn is the catalytic constant for a molar fraction of deuterium (n) and kcat f 0 is the corresponding kinetic parameter in a water solution, was linear for all substrates, indicating that {{only one of the}} four protons transferred from the hydroxy groups of the two molecules of substrate, which are oxidized in one turnover, is responsible for the isotope effects, the proton transferred from the hydroxy group of C- 4 to the peroxide of the oxytyrosinase form (Eox). However, in the representation of Km fn/Km f 0 against n, where Km fn represents the catalytic affinity for a molar fraction of deuterium (n) and Km f 0 is the corresponding kinetic parameter in a water solution, a linear decrease was observed as n increased in the case of o-diphenols with the R group [-H, -CH 3 and -CH(CH 3) 2], and a parabolic increase with other R groups, indicating that more than one proton is responsible for the isotope effects on substrate binding.

No significant differences in percentage survival were found among the different cell lines for each drug tested.

Our results suggest that the diminished pigmentation in all mutants is due to abnormal posttranslational modification of the enzyme: the levels of mRNA for tyrosinase in wild-type, himalayan, and pink-eyed chinchilla melanocytes are similar; the himalayan mutation confers a deficiency in N-linked glycosylation, which results in an extremely unstable enzyme that is also temperature sensitive; the chinchilla and albino mutations confer susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage; the pink-eye dilution confers a reduction in the levels of immunoprecipitable tyrosinase, and what little enzyme there is fails to be translocated from the trans-Golgi network to melanosomes.

The diphenol oxidase functions of forms I and II in leaf preparations were not identical. The activity of I was less stable than that of II. While both were more active with chlorogenic acid, the ratio of activity with chlorogenic acid to that with 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine was less than 50 for I and greater than 50 for II...|$|R
40|$|Melanin {{biosynthesis}} {{involves the}} enzymatic conversion of tyrosine, via dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), to melanin {{through a number}} of intermediate steps. It is generally assumed that the major rate-limiting factor in this process is the amount of active tyrosinase (<b>monophenol</b> monoxygenase; <b>monophenol,</b> dihydroxyphenylalanine: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 14. 18. 1) available since when dopa has been oxidized by tyrosinase to dopa quinone the succeeding steps can occur spontaneously through auto-oxidation. We now present evidence that a later step, namely the conversion of dopachrome to 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid may also be under regulatory control. We have found a factor(s) from 3 different melanomas (Cloudman, B 16, and Greene) which catalyzes this step. This activity is also present in mushrooms, which contain a potent pigment-synthesizing system, but not in a variety of cell lines of nonmelanocytic origin. We have not yet identified the factor but it is of relatively low molecular weight (less than 1000 daltons by Sephadex G 10 gel filtration), negatively charged at pH 6. 8, and stable to boiling. The factor contains no detectable sulfhydryl groups. In crude cell extracts the factor appears to be complexed to tyrosinase since it cochromatographs with tyrosinase through the early steps of purification. The factor binds tightly to QAE-Sephadex anion exchange resin and can be separated from tyrosinase by differential salt elution. We have not yet demonstrated that the factor has a physiological role in melanogenesis but we feel such a role is likely since the activity was found only in cells with melanin-synthesizing systems...|$|R
