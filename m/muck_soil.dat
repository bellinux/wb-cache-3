40|$|Abstract. The {{smouldering}} combustion of peat and <b>muck</b> <b>soil</b> {{plays an important}} role in the creation and maintenance of wetland communities. This experimental study was conducted to improve our understanding of how moisture and mineral content constrain smouldering in organic soil. Laboratory burning was conducted with root mat and <b>muck</b> <b>soil</b> samples from pocosin and pond pine woodland wetlands common on the North Carolina coastal plain. The results of laboratory and prescribed burning were compared. Laboratory results showed that moisture and mineral content influenced sustained smouldering in root mat soils. Predictions based on logistic regression analysis show that root mat soils with an average mineral content of 4. 5 % had an estimated 50 % probability of sustained smouldering at a moisture content of 93 %, whereas at moisture contents above 145 % the estimated probability was less than 10 %. The odds that root mat soil will sustain smouldering decrease by 19. 3 % for each 5 % increase in moisture content. Root mat soils with an average mineral content of 5. 5 % and a moisture content of 93 % had an estimated 61 % probability of sustained smouldering. The odds that root mat soil will sustain {{smouldering combustion}} increased by 155. 9 % with each 1 % increase in mineral content. Root mat and muck soils differ in physical and chemical characteristics expected to influence smouldering behaviour.

A series of studies were conducted in Florida and Costa Rica during 2005 – 2011, on three soil types {{to determine the effects}} of harvest method on microclimate. Green cane harvest produced 11. 4 – 17. 3 t/ha (average for three cropping years) of crop residues across locations. At 2 -cm soil depth, increases in soil temperature during burning were 2. 1 – 2. 5 °C in <b>muck</b> <b>soil,</b> 4. 6 – 5. 8 °C in clay soil, and 6. 0 – 7. 5 °C in sandy soil. At 10 -cm depth, soil temperatures during burning increased by < 0. 5 °C in <b>muck</b> <b>soil,</b> 0. 7 – 0. 9 °C in clay soil, and 1. 9 – 2. 2 °C in sandy soil. During cold nights when air temperatures were near or below freezing, minimum air temperatures near the soil surface were lower for green cane compared to burnt cane harvest methods. The average temperature difference across these near-freeze events was 1. 38 °C (1. 20 °C for muck and 1. 56 °C for sand). There was greater variation in the diurnal range of soil temperature following burnt cane harvest at each location. Soil temperature differences were greater at early growth stages (April) than late growth stages (August). Across soil types, reductions in soil temperature following green cane harvest were greater in sand and clay followed by <b>muck</b> <b>soil.</b> Our results indicate that young shoots emerged from green cane harvested fields may suffer frost damage and delayed growth when air temperatures are near or below freezing. In addition, transient increases in soil temperatures following burning were smaller than normal seasonal variations in soil temperature, suggesting that burning has minimal impact on soil microflora and fauna within the 2 - to 10 -cm soil profile range...|$|E

Knowledge concerning the various properties and requirements of the newly-drained area in Sanpete County, Utah, is extremely limited. A need for fundamental information concerning this type of soil was the basis for the establishment of an experimental farm in this region. The fact that most organic soils respond to mineral fertilizers soon after they have been reclaimed was an important reason for starting fertilizer work on this soil {{as soon as it was}} possible to do so. This thesis reports some of the fertilizer work being conducted on the farm.

The native sedge sod was first broken up in this region in the fall of 1926. The drainage of the area was started in the fall of 1925 and consisted of constructing canals around the project to control spring flood water. A central drain was installed, through the bottom of the area, with sufficient small laterals to properly drain the soil.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{elaborate}} on the analysis of wheat growing in the Czech Republic and to evaluate the influence of variant methods of soil processing winter wheat crops (that are grown after three forecrops: alfalfa, corn for silage and pea plants) on winter wheat yield and economics of growing it. Monitoring was done during the time period 1989 - 2014 using a longterm stationary field experiment that was conducted on clayish <b>muck</b> <b>soil</b> in a beet-growing region, (Ivanovice na Hané). After all three forecrops were planted, they were separated into four different methods of soil processing: ploughing on 0, 22 m, ploughing on 0, 15 m, direct sowing, and loosening on depth of 0, 10 m. The highest yield of winter wheat was achieved by growing it after pea crops, followed by corn for silage and the lowest yield was achieved after alfalfa. The influence of different soil processing on yield of winter wheat was statistically insignificant. The highest average yield of winter wheat was recorded after ploughing on 0, 15 m, followed by ploughing on 0, 22 m, and direct seeding. The lowest yield was achieved after soil loosening {{at a depth of}} 0, 10 m. During the course of the experiment, the highest yield of winter wheat was recorded after the direct seeding into unprocessed soil after the pea plant forecrop. The lowest yield was recorded for direct seeding after alfalfa. In the calculation of the economic evaluation, after all three forecrops, the higher contribution to payment was made by the minimalization methods of soil processing (variants 3, 4) and lower by the methods of ploughing (variants 1, 2). On average, the highest contributions to payment were recorded as winter wheat growing after pea plants and the lowest contributions recorded after alfalfa plants.
