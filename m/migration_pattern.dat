5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the <b>migration</b> <b>pattern</b> of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA “role set” is the set {{of classes}} in a class {{hierarchy}} where an object may reside simultaneously. A “migration pattern” is a sequence of role sets that an object can migrate through. We define a “migration inventory”, which {{is a set of}} <b>migration</b> <b>patterns,</b> as a dynamic integrity constraint on object migration. We consider three update languages: SL which has five operators, CSL+ which extends SL with positive conditionals, and CSL which allows both positive and negative conditionals. Three subclasses of <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of transactions are studied which are immediate-start, proper, and lazy patterns. It is shown that the family of all (immediatestart, proper, or lazy) <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of every set of SL transactions is a regular set and the converse also holds. In particular, testing “satisfiability” of an inventory by a set of transactions is decidable. For the extended languages, we give a weaker characterization. The family of all (immediate-start, proper, or lazy) <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of every set of CSL (CSL+) transactions is recursively enumerable (r. e.). However, every r. e. inventory can be the family of all <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of some set of CSL+ (CSL) transactions and be a left quotient of the family of immediate-start <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of another set of CSL+ (CSL) transactions by a regular set. Although the exact characterizations of immediate-start, proper, lazy <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of CSL+ (CSL) transactions are still open, it is proved that every context-free inventory can be the family of proper and immediate-start <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> of some CSL+ (CSL) transactions. Testing satisfiability of an inventory by a set of CSL (CSL+) transactions is unfortunately undecidable...|$|R

5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical <b>migration</b> <b>pattern.</b> Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the <b>migration</b> <b>pattern</b> of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a <b>migration</b> <b>pattern,</b> vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter {{in the south}}west of the US.|$|E

In Florida, gulf fritillaries have two major flights during the year.

The first and second migrations occur in the spring and the fall, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} or repeat {{migration is}} the temporary and usually repetitive movement of a migrant worker {{between home and}} host areas, typically {{for the purpose of}} employment. It represents an established pattern of population mobility, whether cross-country or rural-urban. There are several benefits associated with this <b>migration</b> <b>pattern,</b> including gains in financial capital, human capital, and social capital. There also costs associated with circular migration, such as brain drain, poor working conditions, forced labor, and the inability to transfer acquired skills to home economies. Socially, there are strong connections to gender, health outcomes, development, poverty, and global immigration policy.|$|E
25|$|Mutation rate {{of human}} genome {{is a very}} {{important}} factor in calculating evolutionary time points. Researchers calculated the number of genetic variations between human and apes.

At the same time, the Cossacks continued much of their Zaporozhian legacy, including a Kuban Bandura movement and the Kuban Cossack Choir which {{became one of the most}} famous in the world for their performance of Cossack and other folk songs and dances, performed in both the Russian and Ukrainian languages.|$|E

40|$|Lifecourse (age-related) <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in the racially selective suburbanization of metropolitan populations that took place in the immediate postwar decades. During this period, the members of successive white population cohorts chose suburban destinations just prior to the ages of greatest residential stability, and tended to remain in suburban locations for the remainder of the lifecourse. At the same time, members of black population cohorts were effectively barred from selecting suburban destinations at all ages of the lifecourse. Recent changes in family formation patterns and race relations have prompted expectations that lifecourse <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> will change in ways that should bring about a more racially balanced city-suburb redistribution process. This investigation adopts the demographer's cohort-component projection model to examine these expectations for six large SMSAs. White and black lifecourse <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> have become more alike in the post-l 970 period; yet, significant racial disparities still exist. Recent lifecourse <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> do not imply an eventual metropolitan-wide integration of the races...|$|R

500|$|Although fin {{whales are}} {{certainly}} migratory, moving seasonally {{in and out}} of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall <b>migration</b> <b>pattern</b> is not well understood. Acoustic readings from passive-listening hydrophone arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the Labrador-Newfoundland region, south past Bermuda, and into the West Indies. One or more populations of fin whales are thought to remain year-round in high latitudes, moving offshore, but not southward in late autumn. [...] A study based on resightings of identified fin whales in Massachusetts Bay indicates that calves often learn migratory routes from their mothers and return to their mother's feeding area in subsequent years.|$|E

Statistical information from this database includes International Net Migration data, which is available for 192 countries dating back to 1955 and is projected through 2050. Countries that have similar <b>migration</b> <b>patterns</b> will be viewed as close together in this functional map, while countries with different patterns are far apart, regardless of the physical distance between the countries.
