5000|$|The {{first prize}} went to Dominique Grégoire {{from the company}} TechniGREG who {{developed}} new tracing systems: TraciLOG and TraciMEAL. This improved monitoring of the cold chain is {{a major step forward}} as far as consumer safety is concerned. The principle is to endow each <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> with [...] "electronic intelligence", thus enabling it to log each of the phases through which it passes, monitor its internal temperature and record information about whether its doors are open or closed. This information is gathered automatically and securely, without any contact with the contents, and requires no human intervention. It is a reliable global management indicator for use by the logistics service in charge of maintaining the cold chain. Altran engineers worked {{side by side with the}} prize-winner, on conducting market studies, on the choice of suppliers, at developing product packaging, on the design of an electronic module and on the transition to the production stage for both TraciLOG and TraciMEAL. After the support, TechniGREG increased its capital of more than 1 million euros. The efforts of these teams were rewarded in March 2001, when a fully operational version of TraciLOG was installed for the first time by a supermarket distributor. TraciMEAL was adopted last May by an institutional food service provider in Toulouse. Since then, TechniGREG, which has registered many patents related to this innovation, has come into business with many companies, particularly in the air transport sector.|$|E

40|$|Mobile device {{software}} applications play an ever increasing {{role in the}} interaction with ubiquitous computing environments. To grow {{the acceptance of the}} mobile product-lines among the developers, the technology used to implement them should be easy to implement and introduce. This dissertation addresses mobile product-line development related issues in three dimensions. First, based on the success of the software container component technology for server-side enterprise applications, a software container abstraction for mobile applications, called a <b>mobile</b> <b>container,</b> is introduced to organize the common functionality of mobile product-lines. Mobile containers serve as a central point to organize the functionality needed by the mobile applications. A <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> is defined as a hybrid client- and server-side container. A mobile application communicates with the rest of a ubiquitous computing environment as a client of one or more server-side services. Mobile containers organize the common functionality of a mobile product-line as a set of services used by mobile clients, and by server-side applications. Server-side applications contain mobile client specific code to adapt the data and the services requested by the mobile clients based on the limitations that exist in mobile devices, e. g., low screen resolution. Second, attributes are used to model the container services declaratively in the source code. Attributes are known from technologies, such as. NET and Java, where they are used to decorate the program elements of the language, e. g., classes and methods. Attributes extend the language without having to maintain its compiler and are used to emulate domain-specific abstractions (DSA). Attribute families are used as a means to model the domain variability. A lightweight language extension is created that enables accessing and manipulating the annotated code. Languages that contain attribute transformation support, as part of their core functionality, will be called Generalized and Annotated Abstract Syntax Tree (GAAST) languages. GAAST-languages enable better language support for the code transformations applied {{in the context of the}} Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). Third, a structured modularization of attribute-driven transformers is introduced to ease the interpretation of attribute-based DSA. Specialized attribute transformers connect the attribute-based DSA with the container services, exposed as object-oriented (OO) libraries. Attribute-driven transformers are horizontally modularized based on the characteristics of the modeled domain. The semantics of the domain assets, expressed as attribute families, are used to determine the transformation workflow. A uniform composition model for transformers based on the inner attributes is developed. Transformers state their dependencies declaratively by decorating the processed elements with arbitrary information in the form of inner attributes. This information is used to coordinate the code processing by successor transformers. The hardwired OO language meta-model is utilized to introduce a vertical modularization of the attribute-driven transformers. The transformation strategy is structured according to the nesting of the structural elements found in the language meta-model. The layering strategy is enforced by operations, specialized for every supported element of the language meta-model. These operations form a specialized language for attribute-driven transformations. Common attribute operations, such as, checking for attribute dependencies, are declaratively specified and factored out of the individual transformers by using meta-attributes. Meta-attribute enable the decoration of attributes themselves with arbitrary semantics that can be automatically processed. The proposed technology is evaluated by an extensible <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> framework for Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) applications of the Java 2 Mobile Edition (J 2 ME), that run in small mobile devices. Several technical MIDP concerns are addressed, e. g., data persistence, session and screen management, and networking, resulting in a simpler and more declarative programming model, that preserves the architecture of the domain in the individual applications...|$|E

Observations of these methods were used to compare their effectiveness and capacity, and their effects on the welfare of the birds. Gassing whole poultry houses had a much greater capacity than mobile equipment, and catching live birds to bring them to a mobile killing device caused extra stress and could cause pain due to injuries inflicted when catching and handling them. Gassing whole poultry houses with carbon monoxide requires strict safety regulations and, therefore, gassing with carbon dioxide was considered preferable. However, this method is not suited to all types of housing, and in these circumstances mobile killing devices were a useful alternativ...|$|R

As spiritual feminist artists we engage an arts-based praxis of inquiry through ritual labyrinth making, walking, sounding, and spontaneous movements documenting and creatively rendering these experiences. The ancient cross-cultural architecture of the labyrinth offers a <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> for our on-going site-related artworkings. To assist the unfolding of womb understandings that have been emerg-ing within our labyrinthal artworkings we draw from the concepts of chora, the ancient Greek word for space, and Bracha Ettinger’s (2005) matrixial copoiesis, a radical theory that situates itself in the symbolic intrauterine space of the womb. Ettinger’s theory calls us to critical, ethical and aesthetical awareness of the impact our artworkings have on each other and others with whom we are resonating within the matrixial sphere, whether cognized or uncognized. This latter imperative is a corrective to the often unethical practices of art in phallic spheres.

A modern design of cryogenic tank container and stationery cryogenic tank {{is presented in the}} paper. Mobile cryogenics container tank has been designed for transportation of LNG as well as other liquefied cryogenic gases with the temperature down to – 196 °C. The analysis included two types of logistics solutions: one involving the transport full container, which is removable from the vehicle and left in the workplace, and the second solution with reloading from mobile tank into simplified container tank or other mobile tank located in the workplace. Simplified container tank and mobile tank have been designed to storage some cryogenics gases as well as <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> but without transportation of them. Modern and effective insulation materials were applied in the tank structure. Therefore, the liquefied cryogenic gases can be stored for a long time periods.

40|$|The {{formation}} of toxic heavy clouds {{as a result}} of sudden accidental releases from <b>mobile</b> <b>containers,</b> such as road tankers or railway tank cars, may occur inside urban areas so the problem arises of their consequences evaluation. Due to the semi-confined nature of the dispersion site simplified models may often be inappropriate. As an alternative, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has the potential to provide realistic simulations even for geometrically complex scenarios since the heavy gas dispersion process is described by basic conservation equations with a reduced number of approximations. In the present work a commercial general purpose CFD code (CFX 4. 4 by Ansys®) is employed for the simulation of dense cloud dispersion in urban areas. The simulation strategy proposed involves a stationary pre-release flow field simulation followed by a dynamic after-release flow and concentration field simulations. In order to try a generalization of results, the computational domain is modelled as a simple network of straight roads with regularly distributed blocks mimicking the buildings. Results show that the presence of buildings lower concentration maxima and enlarge the side spread of the cloud. Dispersion dynamics is also found to be strongly affected by the quantity of heavy-gas released...|$|R

Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim, using a technique known as [...] "stab-and-drag". A second variation consists of undecorated, round-bottomed bowls. Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs, specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type, that include the so-called Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister on South Ronaldsay, and Taversoe Tuick and Midhowe on Rousay, but has occasionally been found outside of tombs, as at the farmstead of Knap of Howar on Papa Westray. There are scattered occurrences of Unstan ware on the Scottish Mainland, as at Balbridie, and in the Western Isles, as at Eilean Domhnuill. Unstan ware may have evolved into the later grooved ware style, associated with the builders of the Maeshowe class of chambered tomb, which began on Orkney early in the third millennium BCE, and was soon adopted throughout Britain and Ireland. Grooved ware vessels are often highly decorated and flat bottomed, often with patterns similar to those on petrospheres and [...] carved maceheads.|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} potential of heat driven refrigeration or heat pump systems to reduce the CO 2 emissions associated with heating or cooling and adsorption systems offer one way of achieving these aims. A prototype of a compact adsorption generator using the activated carbon -ammonia pair and based on a plate heat exchanger concept has been designed and built. The novel generator has low thermal mass and good heat transfer. The heat exchanger uses Nickel brazed shims and spacers to create adsorbent layers (4 mm to 12 mm thick) between pairs of liquid flow channels of very low thermal mass. The prototype sorption generator manufactured (Figure 1) was evaluated in term of heat transfer capability {{and the results were}} highly satisfactory: the overall generator UA value is about 380 W/K while driven by water as thermal fluid; the cycling period is under 60 s. The activated carbon - ammonia pair must be selected for the specific application and operating conditions. The current prototype could be partially dismantled but the final version will be fully welded without the need for bolted flanges. The combination of two or more identical generators operating out of phase, possibly with mass and heat recovery, constitute a Heat Driven Compressor (HD compressor). Such HD compressors are used in three demonstration projects that are ongoing at Warwick University: - Car air conditioning system driven with waste heat from the engine coolant water (at 90 oC) : The current lab demonstration has produced an average cooling power 1. 6 kW (with about 2 kW peaks) and a COP of about 0. 23 under the EU typical normal conditions (33 oC and 20 oC for condensing and evaporating temperatures respectively). - Gas fired heat pump: This demonstration unit is designed for domestic hot water production and space heating. The machine could deliver hot water at a flow rate of 10 litre/min with a temperature rise of 30 oC and a nominal heating power of 7 kW (conditions suitable for the majority of homes in UK). The system’s target COP of 1. 4 represents substantial fuel savings and emissions reductions over a conventional boiler. - Solar driven <b>mobile</b> <b>container</b> for food conservation: This demonstration solar cooling unit is design to produced 2 kW cooling with 10 m 2 solar collector operating in a desert environment (40 oC and - 10 oC for condensing and evaporating temperatures respectively).
