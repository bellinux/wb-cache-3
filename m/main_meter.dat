40|$|Building system {{commissioning}} comes {{highly recommended}} by energy efficiency experts; however, it is rarely undertaken {{due to the}} cost and care needed to do a comprehensive job. Many existing utility meters provide whole-building 15 -minute interval data {{that can be used}} to pinpoint fan control and HVAC schedule problems. Bulls-eye commissioning uses interval metering to focus detailed commissioning efforts. This paper concentrates on a single customer and how bulls-eye commissioning can be applied to focus the commissioning process. Significant energy savings were found by using interval data in conjunction with outside air temperature to isolate problems with schedules and in the economizer controls. Evaluation of <b>main</b> <b>meter</b> profiles allows detailed commissioning work to be better focused and more effective without the wait and expense of full commissioning services. Bulls-eye commissioning can be applied on its own or can be coordinated with traditional commissioning.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is a critical}} approach to the external music in Nimayian poetry. We have examined some topics with examples of contemporary poetry, topics such as wrap method, {{the end of the}} hemistich, the use of prosodic options, and misleading effect of external music in Nimayian poetry. We also have detected shortcomings at the laws of prosody, done by the scholars, or the implementation of the law, by the poets. We tried to add some provisions and amendments to previous laws, {{to make it easier for}} scholars and poets to recognize the intricacies of external music in Nimayian poetry and get the best out of it.   This article has five parts. Here are the contents of each section separately and summarily: 1. Wrap method in Nimayian poetry Most of the great poets, accepted wrap based on prosody`s law, but sometimes the law is in contrast with the meaning of sentences, and poet is forced to move short part of  a sentence in one hemistich to another or A sentence has to be divided into several parts. It is better to match the sentence structure to the structure of prosody. Isolated short parts of a sentence and use of one or two syllables in each hemistich are signs of poet`s weakness in prosody. 2. The end of hemistiches Contrary to popular belief, making hemistiches Short or long is not completely free in Nimayian poetry, because short syllables at the end of hemistiches considered as long syllables and if we end the hemistiches with short syllables the mathematical order in syllables chain will fail.   3. Prosodic options and necessities Use of prosodic options in Nimayian poetry sometimes can be the reason of dissonance in the external music and make it difficult to understand the <b>main</b> <b>meter,</b> because In classic poems equality of hemistiches help us to find the meter, but in Nimayian poetry hemistiches are unequal and sometimes in short hemistiches by utilization of one prosodic option or necessities, the external music seems abnormal.    This section has four parts: 1 / 3. Prosodic options and necessities in first hemistich of poem  Meter is still not known in first Hemistich of poem, and use of prosodic options and Necessities can make it difficult to understand the true meter, therefore it is better to not using it in this Place.   2 / 3. Taskin  It is better to not using taskin at the end of hemistich and if you did, you should not repeat it in several line, because if you do, the meter seems different. 3 / 3. Eshba' in one-syllabic words It is better to not using eshba' in one-syllabic words, because it is not appealing in the musical aesthetics. 4 / 3. Several prosodic options and necessities in one hemistich According to the musical aesthetics using several prosodic options and necessities in one hemistich of poem is not pleasant.   4. Unexpandability of external music in some meters Meters with united prosodic elements are easily comprehensible and in each of the long syllables, the hemistich can be finished, but in meters with intermittent prosodic elements which are made of two different prosodic elements, the elimination of one element and finishing hemistiches is impermissible. 5. Misleading effect of external music Long and short of hemistiches in some meters is misleading, specifically in this syllables chain: «- -  U - U -  U U - - U - U - [...] . » In classic poems, long and short of hemistiches are not permitted and we can recognize prosodic false by counting syllables, but in Nimayian poetry hemistiches are unequal and sometimes detecting prosodic false is difficult and for this reason, even great poets in Nimayian poetry made mistakes in prosody. We have given some examples in this regard...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Whether {{the meter}} and content in Persian poetry are closely linked {{with each other}} {{is one of the}} {{questions}} that some researchers have attempted to answer it. From their perspective, the <b>main</b> <b>meters</b> of Persian poetry can be classified on the basis of the relationship between themes and concepts and most of great poets have regarded the harmony knowingly or unknowingly. In this article, referring to the fact that methods and reasons of meter selection in poets' poetry and its harmony with content from various perspectives can be studied, and using statistics and by analytical- descriptive method it has been attempted to answer the question: are the meter and content closely linked in the tradition of Persian poetry? And if meters' phonetic compatibility with specific themes is proven, were Persian poets aware of the harmony and regarded that in their poems? Accordingly, in this study, since the ode form is important from the perspectives such as content diversity, being used in studied themes, several <b>main</b> <b>meters</b> in it, being among one of the three main forms of Persian poetry and possibility of specifying the content and writing reason, the proportion of the meter and content harmony in pre-Mogul ode writing tradition has been examined. Twenty poets whose odes are studied and their poems' meter are extracted in this article include: Farokhi Sistani (429), Onsori Balkhi (431), Manouchehri Damghani (432), Ghatran Tabrizi (After 465), Azraghi Haravi (the second half of the fifth century or the beginning of the sixth century), Naser Khosrow (481), Abolfaraj Rooney (late fifth century), Masoud saad (515), Moezi (418 to 421), Sanayi (435), Amagh Bokhari (542 / 543), Osman Mokhtari (544 / 549), Adib Saber (546), Abdulvase Jabali (555), Ghavami Razi (560), Anvari (583), Jamal al-Din Esfahani (588), Khaghani (595), Zahir Faryabi (598) and Kamal al-Din Esmail (635). Total odes registered in complete poetical works of poets mentioned were 3209, of which, 1018 odes were selected that dominant space of their content was happy or sad the majority of is selected. According to the research, themes such as elegy, durance and types of complaints in the area of sad concepts and themes such as greetings and spring description, victory salutation, down returning, marriage, childbirth, love celebration, Eid al-Adha, Eid al-Fitr, century celebration, constructing buildings and mansions are among happy themes' field. The result of this study is that even by accepting the necessity of regarding relative harmony between the meter and content and the difference between the meters, in the tradition of Persian poetry, at least among typical ode writers to the era of Mogul, ware harmony of the meter and content has not been met and acceptance of different meters and their types among poets, above all depend on personal style, prosodic knowledge, familiarity with different meters, poet taste, period style, literary fancy and imitation and repetition tradition in Persian literature. In the literary tradition of pre Moguls, as a meter has been used in writing odes in happy themes such as greeting and salutation of feasts and holidays, the same meter was used in sad themes such as: elegy, complaints and durance, and the presence of conflicting content examples is itself the best cause of the lack of nature harmony relationship between the content and meter in most poems of this period. Only in some versifications and meters a distinction can be seen in terms of application, such as in present versifications and the <b>main</b> <b>meters</b> extracted from them that to some extent in happy and sad themes have different applications. Of course, also this distinction is not the result of conscious choice of meters, according to the content, but is due to different style and geographical tastes of meters selection among various poets and also a dominant literary tradition in each period. In this dominant literary tradition, in some periods due to social and cultural reasons, odes' dominant content was sad and/ or happy, indicating specific meters in typical poets' style...|$|R

50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the <b>main</b> <b>metering</b> jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R
