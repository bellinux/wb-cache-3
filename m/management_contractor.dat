The contract, valued at $1.48 billion, was made retrospective to October 2007, {{and ended in}} August 2011. Since then demolition work {{has been carried out}} by DOE's current environmental <b>management</b> <b>contractor,</b> URS | CH2M Hill Oak Ridge (UCOR). Demolition of the K-25 facility was expected to be completed by July 2014.

The final section of the east wing was brought down on 19 December 2013. The last debris was removed in 2014. Demolition of K-27, the last of the five gaseous diffusion facilities at Oak Ridge, commenced in February 2016. Dignitaries including U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and U.S. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann joined 1,500 workers to watch its final wall come down on 30 August 2016. Workers immediately commenced demolishing the last remaining structure on the site, the K-27 and K-29 power plant (K-731). Its demolition was completed on 28 February 2017.|$|E

Moolin became known for his work ethic and his hard-driving style. It was said that he was the first person in the office and the last to leave {{at the end of the}} day. The Engineering News-Record reported [...] "He demands total dedication, saying, 'Your wife had a baby; so what?'" [...] when it named him the construction industry's Man of the Year in 1976. To spur progress on the pipeline, he started the [...] "Alyeska Sweepstakes," [...] in which each of the five contractors working on the pipeline were compared to each other based on how much of their share they completed on time. In his biggest decision, he canceled Bechtel's contract as <b>management</b> <b>contractor</b> because he felt the company was adding too much bureaucracy between Alyeska and the pipeline contractors. A historian later called the decision [...] "one of the most humiliating defeats" [...] in the history of Bechtel.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Office {{decided to}} procure the {{construction}} work under a [...] "construction management contract", rather than under a Private Finance Initiative, {{in order to}} speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and – in a decision that Fraser stated [...] "beggars belief" [...] – without asking Ministers to approve it. This {{was one of the}} two most flawed decisions which the report singled out, the other was the insistence on a rigid programme. Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a complex building were required. [...] In attempting to achieve early completion, the <b>management</b> <b>contractor</b> produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit. The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual procurement route.|$|E
