In the aftermath of the 1957 Defence White Paper, Red Top was initially seen to be a stopgap measure only until the Bloodhound Mk. II SAM came into service. This meant that some of the planned improvements to Red Top were never carried out, including all-aspect capability (as seen on the later AIM-9L/M Sidewinder).

50|$|In April 1990 a Z-50LS {{received}} modified {{wings and}} was evaluated {{to determine if}} <b>maneuvrability</b> was improved. The plane was designated Z-50LE (Experimental). This unit remained as a prototype and is currently in Moravska Trebova, at the Czech air school.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a kill at such high speeds and in the thin air, a large warhead was {{needed in order to}} have a sufficient blast effect. Large control fins were required to give the missile enough <b>maneuvrability</b> at high altitude. All this necessitated a very large missile and as a result, the R-40 is the largest air-to-air missile to ever enter production. It is slightly larger than the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile.|$|E
50|$|The {{airframe}} of the AR.Drone, {{constructed of}} nylon and carbon fiber parts, measures 57 cm across. Two interchangeable hulls were supplied with the airframe, one designed for indoor {{and one for}} external flight. The indoor hull is made from EPP foam, and encases the circumference of the blades for protection. The outdoors use hull is made from lightweight plastic, and allows for increased <b>maneuvrability.</b> In total, the AR.Drone has six degrees of freedom, with a miniaturized inertial measurement unit tracking the pitch, roll and yaw for use in stabilisation.|$|E
50|$|The 233-ton {{vessel was}} {{propelled}} by steam-powered paddles. Power was generated by 2 small steam engines. The vessel also featured 4 masts and could operate under sail: it was envisaged that the vessel would normally cruise under wind-power, but switch to steam-power during combat operations, to allow maximum <b>maneuvrability.</b> It was armed with just 8 guns but all were 68-pounders, {{the most powerful}} calibre. The on-board furnaces that burnt coal to generate steam {{could also be used}} to heat cannon-shot to a red-hot state, creating highly incendiary missiles.|$|E
50|$|From {{this time}} onwards, instead of fielding a phalanx for battle, the Romans {{deployed}} {{a series of}} small tactical units called manipuli (maniples), arrayed in three lines (triplex acies) in a chessboard pattern (quincunx). The maniples were basically the old centuriae, reconfigured so that those deployed in the front two lines of triplex acies were 20 men larger (120 men) and those in the rear line were reduced to 60 men each. The quincunx offered much greater flexibility and <b>maneuvrability</b> than the large, dense mass of a phalanx. It is believed that the Romans copied the quincunx from their adversaries, the Samnites.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{long-eared bat}} {{is a small}} bat, measuring an average of 8.6 cm in total length, including a tail about 4 cm long. Adults weigh between 5 and 8 g. The fur and wing membranes are light brown in color, and the bat lacks the dark shoulder spots found in the closely related, and otherwise similar Keen's myotis. Compared to other Myotis species, these bats have long ears with a relatively long, pointed tragus; when folded forwards the ears extend well past the nose. They also have a longer tail and larger wing area than most comparably sized Myotis bats, giving them increased <b>maneuvrability</b> during slow flight.|$|E

50|$|Known from subfossil {{bones and}} the {{writings}} of Dubois published in 1674, this bird was larger than its relative F. punctatus on Mauritius, being {{about the size of}} a common kestrel, or around 35 cm from head to tail, with males being noticeably smaller than females. This trait, while present in most birds of prey, is most pronounced in the larger, bird-eating species and reduces between-sex competition by niche differentiation. It can be assumed that the bird was of the same generally brownish coloration as its closest relatives, with a lighter underside and darker spots or stipples, the tail, brown or more probably grey, being banded and tipped black. Its feet were yellow and large relative to the bird's overall size. The wingspan was 60-70 cm, its wings being more rounded than those of the common kestrel - just as in the Mauritius bird - for increased <b>maneuvrability</b> when hunting in the forest. It is probable, but not certain, that the only difference between the sexes was their size. The bird fed mainly on birds, but certainly also on insects and the local gecko; Dubois noted that despite their small size they were able to prey on (presumably half-grown) domestic chickens.|$|E
40|$|Articulated {{vehicles}} {{are known to}} exhibit appreciable yaw oscillations during high-speed directional maneuvers. Excessive vehicle off-tracking of multiple axle semitrailers causes rapid tire wear and poor maneuverability at low speeds. The concepts in articulation damping and forced-steering of the semitrailer axles are investigated to achieve improved low speed maneuverability as well as high speed directional control performance of the vehicle. The concept of a damped articulation mechanism is introduced and its potential benefits in limiting the yaw and lateral oscillations of semi-trailer are investigated. Different force-steering algorithms are formulated to achieve both improved low- and medium-speed <b>maneuvrability</b> and high-speed directional control performance. A nonlinear yaw plane model of an articulated vehicle with a multiple axles semitrailer comprising two articulation dampers and forced-steering of a semitrailer axle is formulated. The cornering forces and aligning moments of a radial truck tire are characterized by a nonlinear function in normal load, side-slip angle and pneumatic trail. The damping forces and moments acting on the sprung masses due to the articulation dampers are derived from the kinematic and dynamic analysis of the articulation mechanism. The equations of motion of the vehicle are solved for typical low-speed cornering and high-speed lane-change and evasive maneuvers. A parametric study is performed to establish the influence of articulation damping coefficients on the magnitude of lateral and yaw oscillations of the semitrailer. The {{results of the study}} show that the yaw and lateral oscillations encountered during high speed directional maneuvers can be significantly reduced by the articulation dampers. The low- and medium-speed <b>maneuvrability</b> and high-speed directional dynamics of the vehicle are further investigated using forced-steering of a semitrailer axle, assuming proportional control and negligible generator dynamics. The results are discussed to highlight the influence of the location of the forced-steering axle, feedback variables and control gains. The study showed that a forced-steering algorithm based on articulation angle and speed sensitive articulation angle offers considerable potentials in realizing both the improved low speed <b>maneuvrability</b> and high-speed directional control performance...|$|E

This platform consists of a multirotor helicopter -with 8 rotorsproviding great stability and <b>maneuvrability,</b> which is able to carry a variety of sensors for trait measurement. The platform is controlled by an electronic autopilot board, which can be programmed for GPS-guided, automatic flight through an open-source ground station software. This platform is currently equipped with a low-cost consumer camera modified for the acquisition of near infrared - green - blue images, thus allowing the capture of high-resolution vegetation index images.

30|$|The uterine {{mobilization}} {{is important}} to expose correctly the vesico-uterine plane, the adnexae, and the posterior cul-de-sac. Several studies compared different types of uterine manipulator and their <b>maneuvrability,</b> underlining the limitations or advantages related to the head and shaft when they are fixed together, limiting exposition or in the other, once there is dye injection capability. A new model of uterine manipulator by suction of endometrial cavity has been studied. Patients were not selected by uterine dimension or by gynecological disease; only the cases of endometrial cancer were excluded. In ten patients, we performed an hysteroscopic study associated to an endometrial specimen before installing the uterine device. No endometrial modification was found between normal endometrial specimen before surgery and after surgical treatment. The Vectec uterine manipulator has been demonstrated to be easy and safe to use.|$|E
30|$|The uterine {{mobilization}} {{is important}} to expose correctly the vesico-uterine plane, the adnexae, and the posterior cul-de-sac. Otherwise, peritoneal lesions or defect of anterior and posterior space may not be evidenced and treated. In addiction pushing and lateralizing the uterus, more anatomical structures and spaces are visualized, such as paravesical and pararectal spaces. They could be accessible to dissection if necessary. Several studies compared different types of uterine manipulator and their <b>maneuvrability,</b> underlining the limitations or advantages related to the head and shaft when they are fixed together, limiting exposition or in the other once there is dye injection capability [2]. The uterine manipulator play the major role during operative laparoscopy approach showing uterine ligaments, parametrial spaces, uterine vessels, and to make colpotomy and hysterectomy; however, also during laparoscopy for adnexal pathology, it is revealed important to expose pelvic space [1 – 3, 5, 6].|$|E
