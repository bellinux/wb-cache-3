It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.

It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{experimental}} study is reported of variable property convection heat transfer of <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> through a double-pipe steam generator. <b>Molten</b> <b>salts</b> flows upward in the vertical passage of annular cross-section and water evaporates {{in the inner}} tube. The heat transfer coefficients of <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> have been calculated under buoyancy-influenced conditions with Reynolds numbers ranging from 2, 500 to 12, 000. A buoyancy parameter which combines Grashof number, Reynolds number and Prandtl number in a particular manner designed to characterize the strength of buoyancy influences. When the buoyancy parameter is less than 10 − 6, the buoyancy is less effective and a correlation equation with a maximum error of 20 % is attained. However, when the buoyancy parameter is greater than 10 − 6, the variable properties of <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> {{have a significant effect}} on heat transfer due to the high temperature difference between inner wall and <b>molten</b> <b>salts.</b> The results presented in this paper show, that <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> flowing upward in a passage of annular cross-section having a chilled inner surface and an adiabatic outer one, the heat transfer behavior is generally similar to that air flowing downward in a passage of annular cross-section with a heated inner wall. But there are certain important differences. The variable properties of <b>molten</b> <b>salts</b> are stronger and the buoyancy force will be impaired under the viscous drag. Enhancement of heat transfer occurs with the onset of buoyancy influences, but more gradually and at a somewhat higher value of buoyancy parameter than the air case. Base on the experimental results, an equation correlated satisfactorily in terms of Nusselt number ratio (mixed to forced) and buoyancy parameter is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a <b>molten</b> <b>salt</b> and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E

In recent years double tank TES systems are evolving towards more simple configurations of a single tank [1], [2], [3], also known as thermocline tank TES systems and, even going beyond, there are already thermocline tanks in process of development where the steam generator (SG) is integrated into the storage tank (European project OPTS).
