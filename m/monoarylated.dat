50|$|Monofluorinated (MOFO) and difluorinated (DIFO) cyclooctynes {{were created}} to {{increase}} the rate through the addition of electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents at the propargylic position. Fluorine is a good electron-withdrawing group in terms of synthetic accessibility and biological inertness. In particular, it cannot form an electrophilic Michael acceptor that may side-react with biological nucleophiles.DIBO (dibenzocyclooctyne) was developed as a fusion to two aryl rings, resulting in very high strain {{and a decrease in}} distortion energies. It was proposed that biaryl substitution increases ring strain and provides conjugation with the alkyne to improve reactivity. Although calculations have predicted that mono-aryl substitution would provide an optimal balance between steric clash (with azide molecule) and strain, <b>monoarylated</b> products {{have been shown to be}} unstable.|$|E

The use of NHCs {{is well documented}} for coupling of alkyl and arylamines, {{but there is little}} precedent for the coupling of ammonia. A new, rationally designed, pre-catalyst (DiMeIHeptCl) Pd(allyl) Cl featuring highly-branched alkyl chains {{has been shown to be}} effective in selective aminations across a range of challenging substrates, including nitrogen-containing heterocycles and those featuring base-sensitive functionality.

40|$|An efficient, in situ {{sequential}} 1, 2 -addition of alkyllithium reagents to benzamides {{followed by}} alpha-arylation {{of the resulting}} alkyl ketones is reported. The use of Pd[P(t-Bu) (3) ](2), as catalyst for the alpha-arylation reaction, allows access {{to a wide variety}} of functionalized benzyl ketones in a modular way. The decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate originated from the 1, 2 -addition liberates in situ a lithium amide, therefore avoiding the need of an external base for the alpha-arylation. The method affords good overall yields with a variety of alkyl lithium reagents, benzamides, and aryl bromides, bearing a range of functional groups with complete selectivity toward the <b>monoarylated</b> products...|$|E
40|$|Project 1 Artifical {{photosynthesis}} {{represents one}} of the most promising concepts of today’s research to forward the use of abundant alternative energy sources. However, as the natural role model, efficient functioning requires an optimized interplay of many processes. Therefore, in this work the immobilization, electrochemical stability and complexation of donor ligands, which contain a 2, 2 ’-bipyridine terminal group motif have been investigated as part of a potential artificial photosystem. Furthermore this thesis describes the synthesis of new [Pd(II) (bpy) X 2]-type complexes bearing unsymmetrical substituted 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands. These allow evaluating the influence of substituents and anionic monodental ligands on optical- and electrochemical properties and their catalytically activity. Unsymmetrically substituted bipyridine ligands were prepared by palladium-catalyzed C-H bond arylation of pyridine N-oxides using pyridine halides. Depending on substitution patterns of pyridine halides, the formed products were obtained in 50 - 65 % yield. Synthesis of 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands have been completed by subsequent reduction of bipyridine N-oxides to 2, 2 ’-bipyridines in excellent yields. For the preparation of donor ligands, derivatives of ethyl [2, 2 ’-bipyridine]- 4 -carboxylate were saponified and functionalized via amide linking to obtain terminal thiols, symmetrical disulfides and a terminal aryl diazonium salt. [Pd(bpy) Cl 2]-type complexes bearing unsymmetrically substituted-, as well as unsubstituted 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands were prepared using two different synthesis routes. The treatment of 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands with PdCl 2 in refluxing acetone gave very good yields of 85 - 94 %. However the treatment of Pd(CH 3 CN) 2 Cl 2 in acetonitrile showed losses of yield depending on the substitution pattern of the bipyridne. [Pd(bpy) (OAc) 2]-type complexes were prepared in 61 % to quantitative yields. Complexation of Pd(OAc) 2 was sterically hampered by substituents in C 6 ’ position of the 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligand. In a further synthesis step, the anionic acetate ligands could be successfully exchanged by trifluoroacetate. The complexes were characterized by standard methods and their electronic properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Three donor-ligands have been immobilized and subsequently charaterized by surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) in combination with cyclic voltammetry. In a spectroelectrochemical cell, a nanostructured goldfilm served as both a signal amplifier and as working electrode. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N-(4 -mercaptophenyl) -[2, 2 ’-bipyridine]- 4 -carboxamide (aromatic donor ligand) and N,N’-(disulfanediylbis(ethane- 2, 1 -diyl)) bis(([2, 2 ’-bipyridine]- 4 -carboxamide)) (aliphatic donor ligand) were successfully prepared by immersion of gold surfaces into a dilute ethanolic solution of adsorbate molecules. DFT calculations allowed assignment of SAM absorption bands to normal modes of donor ligand molecules and SAM orientations could be estimated in three-dimensional space based on the relative intensities of the characteristic absorption bands of amide group. DFT structures, optimized in terms of geometry, of aromatic as well aliphatic donor ligand indicated a free accessibility of bipyridine groups for further complexation. Electrochemical studies in acetonitrile showed that the potential stability of these SAMs is largely determined by the molecular structure of donor ligands. The inert potential window of a pure SAM consisting of the aliphatic donor ligand was only limited by the oxidation of gold electrode, i. e. from 0. 45 ± 0. 08 V to 1. 9 ± 0. 08 V vs Fc/Fc+. However, the stable potential window of a SAM consisting of aromatic donor ligand was limited in both anodic and cathodic potentials due to redox processes, which modified the SAM structure irreversibly. In the anodic potential window spectroelectrochemical investigations implied a polymerization that causes partial desorption of SAM molecules. Formation of quinone-like species via electrochemically induced polymerization was postulated. In the cathodic potential window spectroscopic data proposed partial degeneration, in which the bipyridine moiety is cropped caused by a reduction of the bipyridine moiety (E 0 = 1. 32 V vs Fc/Fc+). Thus, the inert potential window of a monolayer consisting of aromatic donor ligand was limited to 0. 20 ± 0. 08 V to 1. 20 ± 0. 08 V vs Fc/Fc+. Subsequent complexation of bipyridine-terminated monolayers succeeded with Pd(CH 3 CN) 2 Cl 2 und [Pd(CH 3 CN) 4](BF 4) 2. Furthermore the formation of homogenously mixed monolayers have been investigated. For this purpose, pure monolayers of thiophenol and EtSH spacer molecules were formed and subsequently doped with 10 - 25 % of the aromatic and the aliphatic donor ligand, respectively. The mixed monolayer consisting of EtSH and aliphatic donor ligand was stable in the investigated potential window from 0. 40 ± 0. 08 V to 1. 9 ± 0. 08 V vs Fc/Fc+. In accordance with the pure monolayer consisting of the aromatic donor ligand, the mixed SAM of TP and aromatic donor ligand exhibited limited potential stability (0. 20 ± 0. 08 V to 1. 20 ± 0. 08 V vs Fc/Fc+). Complexation of bipyridine moiety of mixed monolayers was performed using Pd(CH 3 CN) 2 Cl 2. The diazotized donor ligand was immobilized on gold and glassy carbon electrodes by electrochemical grafting. Spectroelectrochemical studies suggested a polymeric structure of the immobilized thin organic layer. Electrochemical investigations showed that the thin layer is stable from 0. 90 ± 0. 08 V to 1. 18 ± 0. 08 V vs Fc/Fc+, where the anodic potential window is only limited by the oxidation of gold. At cathodic potentials an irreversible degeneration has been observed, analogous to aromatic SAMs of thiols. In a subsequent step, the complexation of the bipyridine moiety of immobilized species succeded with Mn(CO) 5 Br and with [IrCp*Cl 2] 2. The [Pd(II) (bpy) X 2]-type complexes showed no electrocatalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol or corresponding sodiumsalt of benzyl alcohol at room temperature. In temperature-depending experiments using para-benzoquinone as oxidant an influence on the substitution pattern of the 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands as well as of the aniodic ligand was observed in catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Predominantly [Pd(bpy) Cl 2]-type complexes, bearing C 6 ’-substituted 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligands, as well as [Pd(II) (2, 2 ’-bipyridine) (CH 3 CN) 2]BF 4 were catalytically active in the oxidation of BnOH in low yields between 9 - 24 %. Investigations of electrocatalytical oxidation of BnOH by Pd-complexated SAM consisting of aliphatic donor ligand showed that gold is an unsuitable surface due to its pronounced activity towards this reaction. Project 2 Direct conversions of C-H bonds into C-C bonds represent a more environmentally and economically favorable strategy in contrast to traditional cross coupling reactions. To achieve regioselective functionalization of a single C-H bond within a complex molecule, the common strategy involves the use of substrates containing directing groups. In this study, palladium-catalyzed arylations of benzophenone and its derivatives with coupling reagents assisted by strong and weak directing groups have been investigated. Palladium-catalyzed arylations of benzophenone with aryl iodides in TFA using Ag 2 O as an additive as described, showed that the substrate scope is limited to electron-withdrawing aryl iodides. The <b>monoarylated</b> product was isolated in 30 % yield for coupling of benzophenone with 1 -iodo- 4 -nitrobenzene. However, homocoupled biphenyl products were predominantly formed in arylations of benzophenone with iodobenzene, 1 -iodo- 4 -methylbenzene or 1 -iodo- 4 -methoxybenzene. For investigating strong chelating substrates, the ketimines N-(diphenylmethylene) aniline and N-(diphenylmethylene) - 4 -methylaniline, as well as ketimine-derived palladacycles were prepared and reacted with coupling reagents. Reactions of both N-(diphenylmethylene) aniline and the derived palladacycle with 4 -iodotoluene in TFA gave a <b>monoarylated</b> species, which does not correspond to the expected <b>monoarylated</b> product. Subsequent studies have suggested a coupling product, which was formed by double C-H activation. The structure of this species could not be solved. Furthermore both N-(diphenylmethylene) aniline and the derived palladacycle were reacted with tolyl palladium complexes using silver salts in toluene at 120 °C. The <b>monoarylated</b> product was detected as a result of a reaction of [PdI(o-tolyl) (PtBu 3) ] with N-(diphenylmethylene) aniline using AgOCOCF 3. Under the same reaction conditions the derived palladacycle did not result in the conversion to the <b>monoarylated</b> product. Thus, this reaction was proposed to proceed via coordination of ketimine to tolyl palladium complex. The <b>monoarylated</b> product was isolated in 40 % and 7 % yield, respectively by transformation of both p-tolylboronic acid and 4 -methylbenzenediazoniumtetrafluoroborate with the ketimine-derived palladacycle at room temperature. The yields can be hampered by impurities of the ketamine-derived palladacycle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{selective}} catalytic activation/functionalization of sp 2 C–H {{bonds is}} expected to improve synthesis methods by better step number and atom economy. This chapter describes the recent achievements of ruthenium(II) catalysed transformations of sp 2 C–H bonds for cross-coupled C–C bond formation. First arylation and heteroarylation with aromatic halides {{of a variety of}} (hetero) arenes, that are directed at ortho position by heterocycle or imine groups, are presented. The role of carboxylate partners is shown for Ru(II) catalysts that are able to operate profitably in water and to selectively produce diarylated or <b>monoarylated</b> products. The alkylation of (hetero) arenes with primary and secondary alkylhalides, and by hydroarylation of alkene C=C bonds is presented. The recent access to functional alkenes via oxidative dehydrogenative functionalization of C–H bonds with alkenes first, and then with alkynes, is shown to be catalysed by a Ru(II) species associated with a silver salt in the presence of an oxidant such as Cu(OAc) 2. Finally the catalytic oxidative annulations with alkynes to rapidly form a variety of heterocycles are described by initial activation of C–H followed by that of N–H or O–H bonds and by formation of a second C–C bond on reaction with C=O, C=N, and sp 3 C–H bonds. Most catalytic cycles leading from C–H to C–C bond are discusse...|$|E
40|$|Stroke is the 3 rd {{leading cause}} of death in the United States. For this reason, it has become our goal to find a drug that is capable of reestablishing {{intracellular}} and extracellular Ca+ 2 flux upon direct binding to the sigma receptor, which can be delivered easily and efficiently. Our active research focuses the development of guanidine analogues that can serve as therapeutic drugs which target sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors having a direct effect on Ca+ 2 levels on the cell. The use of symmetrical guanidine analogues such as N,N 2 ̆ 7 -di-o-tolyl guanidine (o-DTG) as therapeutic drugs for ischemic stroke, is promising {{due to the fact that}} neuronal cells can restore the proper blood flow and block Ca+ 2 flux into the cell. Our main objective is to be able to develop a cost efficient, mild reaction methodology that affords access to guanidine analogues. The synthetic design of the guanidine analogues has been accomplished using copper-catalyzed cross-coupling diarylation reaction. This methodology employs a non-expensive guanidine salt and substituted aryl iodides along with N,N 2 ̆ 7 -diethylsalicylamides as the key ligand in this strategy. Similar methodology was employed for the synthesis of <b>monoarylated</b> amidines employing ligand-free conditions for the copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Moreover, efforts to find alternative methodologies to access other sigma receptor ligands were accomplished. A new method to create N,N 2 ̆ 7 -disubstituted carbamides employed HATU as a peptide coupling agent allowing for the formation of carbamides using the inexpensive guanidine nitrate and carboxylic acids as starting materials. Studies on the sigma response of the cortical neuron cell were conducted upon completion of the analogue design. Moreover, it was discovered that N,N 2 ̆ 7 -di-p-bromophenyl guanidine (p-BrDPhG) gave a higher Ca+ 2 inhibition than N,N 2 ̆ 7 -di-o-tolyl guanidine (o-DTG). Experimental studies, such as the middle cerebral occlusion were conducted on rats and subsequent injections of the p-BrDPhG at 24, 48, and 72 hours 2 ̆ 7 time marks. When compared to o-DTG, it was found that p-BrDPhG is better at reducing the ischemic volume on the brain siz...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{complexes}} of Cu(I/II) and Pd(II) with N,S and N,O ligands. Main focus {{of the study was}} the residual MCl (CuCl, CuCl 2 CoCl 2, ZnCl 2 and PdCl 2) functionality in final products. In some cases the reactions did not afforded the desired products and in most of the reactions the desired target was achived. The reactions were validated by repeating and using other metals in some cases such as Co(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II). Three principle series of ligands (O,N- and S,N-donor) were designed and synthesized and their reactions with salts containing metals like Cu and Pd were carried out under different reaction conditions. The ligands with O,N donor sites derived from pyridine- 2, 6 -carbonyldichloride. Derivatization of 2, 6 -Pyridinedicarbonyl dichloride, thiophene- 2, 5 -dicarbonyl dichloride and phenyl(chloro) dithiofarmate was carried out by treating them with pyrazole (1, 4, 7), 3 methylpyrazole (2, 5, 8) and 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole (3, 6, 9). These reactions led to the desired products as a result of HCl elimination in the presence of catalytic amount of trimethylamine at room temperature. The aminopyridinato ligand (12) was synthesized by treating the Grignard reagent derived from 2 -bromo- 6 -(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) pyridine formed in situ, with 2, 6 dibromopyridine in the presence of [NiBr 2 (DME) ] (DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane) and tricyclohexylphosphane (1 : 2 ratio). The reaction led to the corresponding <b>monoarylated</b> bromopyridines. The bromopyridine derivative undergos Pd-catalysed aryl amination (Buchwald?Hartwig amination) with 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline give rise to the expected compound 12. The compounds 1 - 3 and 7 - 9 were colorless solid crystalline material and their structures were determined with the help of X-ray diffraction while compounds 4 - 6 were obtained in liquid state. The solid state structures reveal that short range intermolecular interactions afford 1 D (1, 8) and 2 D (2, 3) supra-molecular chains, respectively. All novel compounds were also characterized with the help of Elemental analysis and NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy. The solution state structures were compared with solid state structures. The pyrazolyl drivitives of Pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarbonyl dichloride upon treating with Cu(CH 3 COO) 2. H 2 O in aqueous medium give complexes 13 - 15 due to the in situ dissociation of 13. The resultant complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and single crystal XRD. The set of data obtained for these complexes showed that MOFs were afforded (13 and 14) while mononuclear heterolyptic complex (15) as a result of in situ dissociation of the corresponding ligand was obtained. Precursors 4 - 6 were oily products and were characterized with the help of 1 H- and 13 CNMR spectroscopy. These ligands were soluble in common organic solvents. They were further treated with CuCl salt to give complexes 16 and 17, the structure of these complexes were confirmed with the help of X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. These compounds give bimetalic crystalline copper complexes, 16 and 17 with monoclinic and triclinic geometry, respectively. Ligands 4 - 6 were treated with PdCl 2 salt in acetonitrile and complexes 18 - 20 with PdCl 2 residual functionalities were formed in essentially quantitative yield. The ligands were found to be N,S-bidentate linkers and 5 -membered copper and palladacycles were obtained. Reaction of ligand 4 with Ni(II) salt suffers from in situ dissociation of the ligand followed by rearrangement into monoanionic ligand. The rearranged ligand is attached to metal centre in the ratio 2 : 1 (ligand:metal) and metallacycle 21 was afforded. Due to partial solubility of Pd and Ni complexes, complete set of NMR could not be collected, 18 (1 H and 13 C), 19, 20, 21 b (1 H). While single crystal analysis of complexe 18, 19 and 21 was carried out. The results reveal that compound 18 bears triclinic geometry while compounds 19 and 20 are monoclinic. The aminopyridinato ligand 12 was used for the synthesis of complex 22 containing CuCu bond and mononuclear cobalt complex 23. Complexes 22 and 23 were completely characterized with the help of NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal analysis. The results thus revealed that Cu-Cu bond exists in the corresponding binuclear complex having a separation of 2. 450 Å. When CoCl 2 was treated with aminopyridinato ligand {{in the same way as}} complex 22, the resultant complex was a homolyptic rather than bimetallic containing Co-Co bond. The reactivity of Cu-Cu bond with group 15, 16 and 17 elements amazingly gave no results, and showed tremendous stability. Complexes of M(II) with 3 -methylpyrazole as ligand were prepared at ambient temperature using MCl 2 salts (M = Cu, Co, Pd and Zn). All reactions were straight forward and no appreciable amount of side products was detected. X-ray structures were determined for all the complexes. The structures reveal that 28 and 29 possess Octahedral geometry, while 22 and 23 are square planar and tetrahedral, respectively. The synthesized compounds 28 - 31 have the MCl 2 fragment, thus making the synthesized compounds attractive synthons for further transformations. The cyclic voltammetric investigations indicate the involvement of proton during electron transfer reactions of these complexes. The cyclic voltammograms of the synthesized complexes were obtained and the voltammetric signatures of 28, 29, and 31 showed a single irreversible pHdependent cathodic peak, while 30 gives two reversible cathodic peaks. Involvement of protons accompanying the electron transfer processes was ascertained from differential pulse voltammetric results, indicating peak potential shift as a function of pH. From the results it can be concluded that 15, 28, 29 and 31 show irreversible cathodic peaks so these complexes may be used as good anticancer agents. The ligands 1 - 3 and their complexes were tested against different strains of bacteria as antibacterial agents. The results reveal that ligands possess good inhibition activities compared to their respective complexes. While complex 15 was studied as representative example for DNA bonding potency using Cyclic Voltametric technique. The complexes 16 - 20 were also tested for their catalytic activity in Suzuki-coupling reactions, the complexes having palladium as central metal atoms show some how high catalytic activities as compared with other complexes. The activity is too low which hinders further studies and use of these complexes for commercial purpose...|$|E
