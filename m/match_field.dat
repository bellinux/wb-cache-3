The localization methodology is applied to an ultrasonic guided wave structural health monitoring system for detecting, locating, and imaging damage in civil infrastructures.

Acquiring the characteristics of these propagation mediums from data represents a difficult inverse problem for which, in general, no readily available solution exists. In this dissertation, we build data-driven models of these complex mediums by integrating experimental guided wave measurements with theoretical wave propagation models and ℓ 1 sparse recovery methods from compressed sensing.

In the end, lots of numerical experiments with three small aperture arrays are processed in the classical shallow water, and the performance of <b>matched</b> <b>field</b> passive localization is evaluated.

The model was modified for the weevil to accommodate its unusual habit of overexploiting local resources.
