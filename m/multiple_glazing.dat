40|$|Abstract Modern {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} the use of large glazed surfaces. New technologies ensure thermal insulation by <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> units so that, maintaining good solar gains, highly glazed buildings can achieve good energy performance during the heating season. More complicated is the management of the energy performance during the cooling season due to high permeability to solar radiation. External shading devices are a suitable solution but they are often neglected for functional and aesthetic reasons. Solar protection devices can be, however, introduced in the air gap of <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> units, providing solar protection without interfering with the building envelope. Solar and thermal properties of several solution of glazing units with in-gap shading devices were measured with advanced experimental set-up, to be compared with conventional systems. Numerical analyses were also performed to estimate the impact of this technology on the energy performance of office buildings...|$|E
40|$|A closed-analytical {{expression}} for the {{solar heat gain}} coefficient (SHGC) of a glass-glass photovoltaic module for building-integration is constructed ab initio, from the thermal study of the general case of any number of planar parallel layers with homogeneous absorption of solar radiation. By introducing the optical model of Baenas and Machado, the expressions for the SHGC of the opaque and transparent parts of the module will be provided. The scope of the calculation and the assumed working hypothesis are in line with those of international standards for <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> systems and building-integrated photovoltaic modules. The proposed model has been applied to a real case of study, showing an excellent agreement with the numerical and experimental related data.

40|$|Experimental {{results on}} sound {{insulation}} of glazed openings {{are reported in}} this work. The laboratory experiments were performed placing the text specimens between two relatively small rooms. The number of glass panels, their thickness, the air gap thickness between the panels {{and the type of}} fixing frame are the variables considered. The insulation conferred by the glazed opening is characterised, identifying the localisation of the dips of insulation in the frequency domain with those related to its own natural dynamic vibration modes and those related to the natural modes of vibration of the rooms. Since the full mathematical description of the acoustic insulation conferred by glazed panels is extremely complicated, simplified theoretical models are frequently used. In this work, the experimental insulation curves obtained are compared with those predicted by the simplified analytical models. This analysis shows that the predictive models, particularly when applied to <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> windows, exhibit marked differences when compared with the experimental data. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Directional {{emittance}} {{plays an}} important role in the calculation of radiative heat exchange. It partly determines the thermal insulation of single and <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> and the efficiency of solar collectors. An emissiometer has been designed and built, capable for measurements of the directional emittance at angles up to 85 degree(s). The emissiometer can be used for absolute measurements, with a black body radiator as reference, and for relative measurements using a known reference sample. In the case of low-emissivity materials the directional emittance usually has a maximum at an angle between 80 degree(s) and 90 degree(s) (pseudo Brewster angle). The emissiometer is, therefore, especially useful for the accurate characterization of low-emissivity materials like spectral selective coated glazing and solar absorbers. The paper gives a description of the instrument and results are discussed for three coated glass samples with low, medium, and high emissivity, respectively, which were measured for a temperature of 283 K. Results are given of the calculation of the thermal transmittance (or U-value) and of three types of double glazing in which the low, medium, and high emissivity coating was applied...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} energy simulation program, Energy Plus (E+), cannot use standard window performance indices (U, SHGC, VT) {{to model}} window energy impacts. Rather, E+ uses more accurate methods which require a physical {{description of the}} window. E+ {{needs to be able}} to accept U and SHGC indices as window descriptors because, often, these are all that is known about a window and because building codes, standards, and voluntary programs are developed using these terms. This paper outlines a procedure, developed for E+, which will allow it to use standard window performance indices to model window energy impacts. In this 'Block' model, a given U, SHGC, VT are mapped to the properties of a fictitious 'layer' in E+. For thermal conductance calculations, the 'Block' functions as a single solid layer. For solar optical calculations, the model begins by defining a solar transmittance (Ts) at normal incidence based on the SHGC. For properties at non-normal incidence angles, the 'Block' takes on the angular properties of <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> layers; the number and type of layers defined by the U and SHGC. While this procedure is specific to E+, parts of it may have applicability to other window/building simulation programs...|$|E
40|$|Compiling Team co-leader (Beijing, China) To {{respond to}} {{increasing}} energy {{use in the}} building sector, China has a national effort to develop Energy Codes for building construction. Several years ago, an Energy Code was promulgated for the northern portion of the country, where energy consumption for heating is the primary concern. In 2000 - 2001, an Energy Code was developed for residential buildings in the “Hot-Summer/Cold-Winter ” Zone along the Yangtze River. The Compiling Team consisted of representatives from key cities within the region (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu). International support {{was provided by the}} Energy Foundation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. This work was {{complicated by the fact that}} the “Hot-Summer/Cold-Winter ” Zone area has both significant heating and cooling loads. Consequently, the “Hot-Summer/Cold-Winter ” Zone Energy Code needed to be more sophisticated than the previous Energy Code adopted in China. In addition to balancing the relative importance of heating and cooling loads, the project also involved a judgment of how comfort conditions in residential buildings might be expected to improve over time. The range of energy efficiency measures that were evaluated is presented (including <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing,</b> frame and shading options for windows, and insulation options for the walls and roof). The weather data used is summarized in a companion paper [1]. Key aspects of the code format, compliance options, and requirements are outlined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractInsulated glass {{solar thermal}} {{collectors}} {{result from the}} insertion of a solar absorber into the outer gap of a <b>multiple</b> <b>glazed</b> unit. Taking advantages from the manufacturing technology of the glass and window industry, a flexible and highly automated production {{as well as an}} easier and architecturally more appealing integration into the building envelope is expected. Ensuring long-term functionality, on the other hand, represents a very challenging development task due to high temperatures and to the thermally induced deformations of the solar absorber. The paper analyzes the behavior of this new kind of collector by means of theoretical calculations and experiments, focusing on both the performance and the reliability aspects. Efficiency measurements according to EN 12975 on prototypes with a slim design report specific values comparable to those of standard flat plate collectors (η 0 = 0. 78, a 1 = 3. 77 W/m 2 K, a 2 = 0. 011 W/m 2 K 2 for a 50 mm thick, argon-filled prototype).

40|$|As {{overheating}} {{problems in}} glassy buildings came up more and more, EMPA put {{a focus on}} the determination and modelling of the total solar energy transmittance (TSET) of <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> combined with different shading systems within the framework of IEA Task 27 "Performance, durability and sustainability of solar façade components". Experimental data were produced by a calorimetric outdoor test facility near Zurich (Switzerland). In a first stage, average constant TSET values related to the incident global solar radiation were identified for a various configurations and a measuring period of a few days each. As expected the results strongly depend on the slat tilt angle {{as well as on the}} solar reflectance of the slat surface. Naturally the solar transmittance of an angle-selective component like a Venetian blind also depends on the directional distribution of the incident radiation, in particular on the sun elevation projected into the plane perpendicular to the slat rotation axis. Therefore, results from different measuring periods of the identical shading-glazing configuration are compared, and an extension of the usual average g-value identification is shown. The experimental results are also compared with weighted average g-values from numerical modeling, which is based on a view factor method extended for circular slats in a louver type shading device. In general the agreement between measured and calculated results is good. Some deviation is explained by a significant non-diffuse Albedo component in the hemispherical radiation field. In another paper it was shown that the simplified convective heat transfer calculation used in this model may fail for mechanically ventilated double envelope façades...|$|E

However, the {{pigments}} are not physically mixed, since the paint is left to dry before each successive glaze is applied.

The Painting of the Limoges porcelain in the Limoges box industry are accomplished by small handed French artisans, as experts at the fine brush strokes required for such detailed work. After painting, there are multiple firings. The final firing at a temperature of 1400C is unique to Limoges, giving them a very fine pure and strong white finish. The final touch to a Limoges Box is the metal hinged mountings that are meticulously fitted to the finished box. The entire work process is made by hand, so small variations are the norm, thus making each piece really unique.

40|$|Systems {{involving}} {{solar thermal}} collection into a heat store have a complex dynamical behaviour, {{due to the}} influence of storage temperature on solar collector fluid inlet temperature, {{and on the other side}} the influence of load patterns on the varia-tion of heat storage temperature. The photovoltaic part of a hybrid PVT (PV-thermal) system depends on the complex tem-perature behaviour only through the temperature dependence of collector performance, which is weaker than that of the ther-mal collection part [1]. This paper explores the dynamical behaviour of a number of PVT systems by use of the newly updated time simulation software NSES [2]. Details of the model is described in refs. [4] and more specifically in [5]. The collector model includes solar radiation capture through <b>multiple</b> layers of <b>glazing,</b> mediators and absorbers, with con-sideration of reflection and emittance. The absorbed radiation is converted to electricity with an efficiency that depends on temperature through a quadratic relationship determined from data for various photovoltaic materials. The further use of non-converted solar energy for heat production is achieved by thermalisation of electrons not converted to electricity, in either of the layers, followed by heat transfer by conduction and convection to a working fluid either passing behind the absorber or in front of it (typically water or air). The heat fluid circuit exchanges heat with a thermal store, from which building loads are covered through a secondary heat circuit. The NSES model simulates the behaviour of such systems by an hourly time-step calculation using hourly data sets such as the Danish Reference Year [7] data for solar input (from which radiation upon tilted surfaces is calculated), wind speeds (a f...|$|R
