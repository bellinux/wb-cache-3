5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E

5|$|The Dwarfie Stane tomb on {{the island}} of Hoy is <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single huge block of red {{sandstone}} with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by giants.|$|E
5|$|The tambu is an instrument, and a form {{of music}} and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is {{sometimes}} known as bari), and Curaçao. The tambu is an especially important symbol of Curaçaoan identity. Instrumentation for the tambu uses the agan, chapi, triangle, wiri and other instruments, {{many of which are}} also part of the African-derived muziek di zumbi, or spirit music, of Curaçao. Curaçao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with apentatonic lyrics sung in Guene or a Papiamento variant called seshi. The Simadan harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the cachu trumpet, <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable {{for the use of the}} becu, an aerophone made from the stalk of a sorghum plant, and the kinkon, <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> conch shell and known elsewhere as the carco. Folk song forms range from the harvest seu, simadan and wapa. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American joropo and pasillo, Spanish Caribbean merengue and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the tumba.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, levivot, also known by the Yiddish latkes; and jelly doughnuts, known as sufganiyot in Hebrew, pontshkes (in Yiddish) or bimuelos (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil. Hannukah pancakes are <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of ingredients, from the {{traditional}} potato or cheese, to more modern innovations, among them corn, spinach, zucchini and sweet potato.|$|E

5|$|When the LIFE {{project was}} first proposed, it {{focused on the}} nuclear fusion–fission hybrid concept, which uses the fast {{neutrons}} from the fusion reactions to induce fission in fertile nuclear materials. The hybrid concept was designed to generate power from both fertile and fissile nuclear fuel and to burn nuclear waste. The fuel blanket was designed to use TRISO-based fuel cooled by a molten salt <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mixture oflithium fluoride(LiF) andberyllium fluoride(BeF2).|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

5|$|Chapman and Vause get {{revenge on}} Doggett and trick her {{into believing that}} she has faith healing powers, {{eventually}} culminating in her {{being sent to the}} psychiatric ward. Although Chapman aids in Doggett's release from the psychiatric ward, Doggett still bears a grudge against her. Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to Chapman instead and this leads to Chapman 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, {{has been used for}} clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore cuisine is {{predominantly}} south Indian with rice as its base. Most local restaurants still retain their rural flavor, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf. Eating on a banana leaf {{is an old}} custom and imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines are also available. Idly, dosa, paniyaram and appam are popular dishes. Coimbatore has an active street food culture and various cuisine options for dining. Arisi Paruppu Sadam, <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mixture of dal and rice is a recipe that existed from fourth century CE and unique to the area. Kaalaan is a popular dish prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms (usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy broth, until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped onions and coriander leaves.|$|E
