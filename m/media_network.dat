5|$|On 3 February, Ravalomanana {{dismissed}} Rajoelina {{as mayor}} of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage {{the affairs of the}} capital. Rajoelina denounced the decision and warned {{that it would not be}} accepted by the populace. The following day Rajoelina instead designated Michele Ratsivalaka to succeed him as mayor. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the presidential palace, prompting the presidential guard to open fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200. Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation, although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed. Conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths. The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound on 5 March; they also raided the offices of his Viva <b>media</b> <b>network.</b> Initially they surrounded Viva, and after thirty minutes the staff attempted to remove Viva property, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated the equipment. For the next several days Rajoelina took refuge in the home of the French ambassador, reporting to the press that he feared for his safety.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for articulating how social <b>media</b> <b>networks</b> that are primarily embedded within IT platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, and the “blogosphere ” are theoretically different from previous generations of IT-enabled or purely interpersonal networks. Nevertheless, since social <b>media</b> <b>networks</b> potentially differ from these previous networks in a myriad of different ways, {{it is difficult to}} articulate a coherent research agenda. After addressing the relationship between social <b>media</b> and social <b>networks,</b> we argue that the source of social capital (structure and content) and locus of agency (user and platform) can be useful for designing a coherent and manageable research agenda examining the distinctive characteristics of social <b>media</b> <b>networks.</b> The initial framework provided can facilitate theorizing and empirical research of social <b>media</b> <b>networks</b> and can be used to generate research questions for future investigations. The work is intended to encourage, not resolve, a robust theoretically driven research agenda regarding social <b>media</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia <b>Media</b> <b>Network</b> to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E
