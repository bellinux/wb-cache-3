50|$|Benzatropine is a {{centrally}} acting anticholinergic/antihistamine agent. It is {{a selective}} M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Benzatropine partially blocks cholinergic {{activity in the}} basal ganglia and {{has also been shown}} to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of benzatropine is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of <b>mepyramine.</b> Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. Benzatropine antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine, decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine, which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson's disease.|$|E

40|$|Background: Histamine is {{detected}} in high {{concentrations in the}} airways during an allergic asthma response. In a murine model of allergic asthma, JNJ 7777120, an antagonist at the histamine H 4 receptor, reduces asthmatic symptoms, while the histamine H 1 receptor-selective antagonist <b>mepyramine</b> is virtually without effect. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of combined antagonism at the histamine H 1 and H 4 receptors in a murine asthma model {{in relation to the}} timing of their application, i. e. sensitization or provocation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Asthma was induced in mice by sensitization and provocation with ovalbumin. JNJ 7777120 and/or <b>mepyramine</b> were injected subcutaneously either during sensitization or during provocation, and typical asthma parameters were analyzed. JNJ 7777120, but not <b>mepyramine,</b> reduced serum concentrations of anti-OVA IgE, inflammatory infiltrations in lung tissue, and eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) -fluids independently of the timing of application. Upon application of JNJ 7777120 plus <b>mepyramine</b> in combination during provocation, <b>mepyramine</b> inhibited the effects of JNJ 7777120. In contrast, when applied during sensitization, <b>mepyramine</b> enhanced the diseaseameliorating effects of JNJ 7777120.

Promethazine, <b>mepyramine</b> and chlorpromazine can inhibit, in decreasing order of activity, the effect of histamine, whilst lysergic acid diethylamide is inactive. Lysergic acid diethylamide and chlorpromazine are equally potent inhibitors of the action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine on the peripheral vascular bed, whilst <b>mepyramine</b> is inactive. Promethazine has intermediate activity. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis is strongly inhibited by chlorpromazine and by promethazine. <b>Mepyramine</b> and lysergic acid diethylamide, each injected alone, affect only weakly the anaphylactic reaction. However, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis is almost completely abolished by the simultaneous injection of the two last antagonists.

In guinea pigs responding to a first allergen exposure with an early as well as a late asthmatic reaction (82 % of the animals) a second, identical, allergen provocation was performed, in the absence (control) or presence of 1 mg/ml <b>mepyramine</b> aerosol, inhaled for 10 min, 1 h before provocation. The <b>mepyramine</b> treatment significantly reduced both early and late asthmatic reactions and prevented the development of bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine and methacholine after both reactions. Examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24 h after the second allergen provocation revealed a general reduction of inflammatory cells after <b>mepyramine</b> treatment.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of <b>mepyramine</b> (H 1 -receptor antagonist), {{famotidine}} (H 2 -receptor antagonist), physostigmine (a cholinesterase inhibitor) and atropine (muscarinic-receptor antagonist) have investigated on the formalin-induced nociception in rats. The effects of <b>mepyramine</b> and famotidine have also examined on nociceptive changes induced by physostigmine and atropine. Nociception was induced by intraplantar injection of formalin (50 Î¼L, 1 %) into the right hind paw and the time spent licking and biting of the injected paw, was taken {{as a measure of}} pain. Formalin induced a marked biphasic (first phase: 0 - 5 min and second phase: 15 - 45 min) pain response. The used drugs did not change the first phase of formalin-induced pain. Subcutaneous injection of physostigmine significantly (p< 0. 05) suppressed pain. Subcutaneous injection of atropine alone did not change the intensity of pain, but pretreatment with atropine significantly (p< 0. 05) prevented physostigmine-induced antinociception. Intraperitoneal injections of <b>mepyramine</b> and famotidine significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased pain response. <b>Mepyramine</b> did not significantly change, but famotidine significantly (p< 0. 05) prevented analgesic effect of physostigmine on pain. Atropine did not inhibit the antinociceptive effects of both <b>mepyramine</b> and famotidine on formalin-induced nociception. These results indicate that physostigmine through muscarinic cholinergic receptors suppresses the pain induced by formalin. Both H 1 and H 2 receptor antagonists produce antinociception.

40|$|Motion {{sickness}} occurs under {{a variety}} of circumstances and is common in the general population. It is usually associated with changes in gastric motility, and hypothermia, which are argued to be surrogate markers for nausea; there are also reports that respiratory function is affected. As laboratory rodents are incapable of vomiting, Suncus murinus was used to model motion sickness and to investigate changes in gastric myoelectric activity (GMA) and temperature homeostasis using radiotelemetry, whilst also simultaneously investigating changes in respiratory function using whole body plethysmography. The anti-emetic potential of the highly selective histamine H 1 receptor antagonists, <b>mepyramine</b> (brain penetrant), and cetirizine (non-brain penetrant), along with the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine, were investigated in the present study. On isolated ileal segments from Suncus murinus, both <b>mepyramine</b> and cetirizine non-competitively antagonized the contractile action of histamine with pKb values of 7. 5 and 8. 4, respectively; scopolamine competitively antagonized the contractile action of acetylcholine with pA 2 of 9. 5. In responding animals, motion (1 Hz, 4 cm horizontal displacement, 10 min) increased the percentage of the power of bradygastria, and decreased the percentage power of normogastria whilst also causing hypothermia. Animals also exhibited an increase in respiratory rate and a reduction in tidal volume. <b>Mepyramine</b> (50 mg/kg, i. p.) and scopolamine (10 mg/kg, i. p.), but not cetirizine (10 mg/kg, i. p.), significantly antagonized motion-induced emesis but did not reverse the motion-induced disruptions of GMA, or hypothermia, or effects on respiration. Burst analysis of plethysmographic-derived waveforms showed <b>mepyramine</b> also had increased the inter-retch+vomit frequency, and emetic episode duration. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that motion alone did not induce c-fos expression in the brain. Paradoxically, <b>mepyramine</b> increased c-fos in brain areas regulating emesis control, and caused hypothermia; it also appeared to cause sedation and reduced the dominant frequency of slow waves. In conclusion, motion-induced emesis was associated with a disruption of GMA, respiration, and hypothermia. <b>Mepyramine</b> was a more efficacious anti-emetic than cetirizine, suggesting an important role of centrally-located H 1 receptors. The ability of <b>mepyramine</b> to elevate c-fos provides a new perspective on how H 1 receptors are involved in mechanisms of emesis control...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} in vitro study, using superfusion technique, the {{pharmacological}} responsiveness of the excisional wound granulation tissue myofibroblasts {{to a variety}} of agents were compared with those of normal connective tissue taken from the superficial fascia. Bolus doses of angiotensin II (0. 1 to 1000 nM), <b>mepyramine</b> (1 to 128 ÂµM), calcium chloride (75 to 300 ÂµM) and potassium chloride (100 to 400 ÂµM) were added to the superfusate solution and the responses were recorded on Narco chart recorder. The results showed that both types of tissues have qualitatively similar characteristic responsiveness to potassium and calcium ions, <b>mepyramine</b> and angiotensin II. However, quantitatively, they were distinctly different, the myofibroblasts from granulation tissues produced greater contractile responses to <b>mepyramine</b> and angiotensin II, whilst they lost most of their responsiveness to potassium and calcium ions.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of histamine-stimulated inositol phospholipid breakdown in slices of guinea-pig ileal smooth muscle and cerebellum have been investigated. In cerebellar slices the inhibition of the inositol phospholipid response to histamine by <b>mepyramine</b> {{was consistent with}} competitive antagonism of histamine H 1 -receptors. In slices of the longitudinal smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum, <b>mepyramine</b> produced only a weak inhibition of the response to histamine, at concentrations up to 1 microM. This was in striking contrast to the potent competitive antagonism of the H 1 -mediated contractile responses obtained with <b>mepyramine</b> in this tissue. The H 1 -receptor antagonists (+) -chlorpheniramine and promethazine similarly {{had no effect on}} the EC 50 value for histamine in guinea-pig ileum, while promethazine competitively antagonized the muscarinic receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid response in this tissue (Ka 3. 6 X 10 (7) M- 1). Cimetidine, on its own, did not significantly inhibit the inositol phosphate accumulation elicited by histamine in ileum. In the presence of 0. 2 microM <b>mepyramine,</b> cimetidine (0. 1 mM) produced a small parallel shift of the histamine concentration-response curve (Ka 3 X 10 (4) M- 1). This inhibition, however, was not consistent with antagonism of an H 2 -receptor-mediated response. The effect of a range of histamine analogues on inositol phospholipid breakdown was determined. Dose-response curves were constructed and characterized in terms of the EC 50, slope and maximal response attainable relative to histamine. The H 1 -agonists, N alpha,N alpha-dimethylhistamine, N alpha-methylhistamine, 2 -pyridylethylamine and 2 -thiazolyethylamine produced the largest accumulations of [3 H]-inositol- 1 -phosphate. A very weak response was produced by the H 2 -selective agonist impromidine, while dimaprit (also H 2 -selective) was without significant effect. <b>Mepyramine</b> appeared to antagonize competitively the response to the H 1 -selective agonist 2 -pyridylethylamine. This was in contrast to the data obtained with other H 1 -agonists, where <b>mepyramine</b> produced only a small dextral shift of the agonist curves at low agonist concentrations and an increase in the Hill coefficient. This was particularly striking in the case of 2 -methylhistamine. The results suggest that an H 1 -receptor component in guinea-pig ileum, may coexist with a larger inositol phospholipid response to histamine which is independent of the activation of H 1 - or H 2 -receptors...|$|E

40|$|The {{depressor}} {{responses to}} histamine, in anaesthetized cats and dogs, {{have been shown}} to involve both histamine H 1 - and H 2 - receptors.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} intracerebroventricular (ICV) {{administration}} of normal saline (control), histamine, <b>mepyramine</b> (a histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist) and ranitidine (a histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist) were investigated on the formalin-induced pain in rabbits. Subcutaneous (SC) injection of a formalin (100 Î¼l, 5 %) solution into the ventral surface of the right hind paw was performed, and the time durations spent licking and biting the injected paw were measured in 10 min blocks for 1 h. The SC injection of formalin produced a short-lasting (10 min) pain response. The ICV injection of histamine at doses of 25, 50 and 100 Î¼g significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased the time duration spent licking and biting the injected paw. <b>Mepyramine</b> and ranitidine, used alone produced no effects. The ICV pretreatments with <b>mepyramine</b> and ranitidine at the same dose of 200 Î¼g significantly (P < 0. 05) prevented histamine (100 Î¼g, ICV) -induced antinociception.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{histamine}} {{have been studied}} on human isolated coronary artery preparations taken from hearts {{ranging in age from}} 9 to 73 years. Histamine in large concentrations (100 microM) contracted arteries which were without tone or spontaneous activity and sometimes induced rhythmic contractile activity. If spontaneous rhythmic activity was present it was enhanced by histamine. The contractile effects of histamine were inhibited by <b>mepyramine</b> but not by cimetidine. Arteries which were contracted by depolarization responded with relaxation to histamine concentrations lower than those required to evoke a contraction; arteries from younger hearts were more sensitive than those from older hearts. <b>Mepyramine</b> potentiated the maximal relaxant effect of histamine in arteries from hearts of all ages but cimetidine had very little effect. In the presence of <b>mepyramine,</b> cimetidine antagonized the relaxant effect of histamine, shifting the concentration-effect curve to the right. It is concluded that human coronary arteries contain both H 1 - and H 2 -type receptors, the H 1 -receptors mediating contraction.

40|$|Anaphylactic bronchoconstriction {{provoked}} by aerosol challenge, and its pharmacological modulation, {{has been investigated}} in anaesthetized pump-ventilated guinea-pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin (OA). Aerosol challenge (OA 0. 03 - 10 mg ml- 1) provoked immediate bronchoconstriction, the degree of which, and its rate of development, was directly related to antigen concentration. Concomitant changes in heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure following aerosol challenge were reduced compared with systemic (OA, 1 mg kg- 1 i. v.) challenge. Unlike systemic challenge, aerosol challenge did not cause a concomitant fall in either circulating leukocyte or platelet count. When a submaximal (microshock) aerosol challenge stimulus (OA, 0. 3 mg ml- 1, 5 s) was employed, bronchoconstriction was markedly reduced by <b>mepyramine</b> (2 mg kg- 1 i. v.). The residual component of bronchoconstriction was enhanced by indomethacin (10 mg kg- 1 i. v.), an effect which was reversed by either BW 755 C (30 mg kg- 1 i. v.) or FPL 55712 (10 mg kg- 1 i. v.). When a supramaximal (macroshock) aerosol challenge stimulus (OA, 10 mg ml- 1, 5 s) was employed, bronchoconstriction was also markedly reduced by <b>mepyramine.</b> Residual bronchoconstriction was not altered by indomethacin, slowed but not reduced by indomethacin plus BW 755 C, and substantially reduced by indomethacin plus FPL 55712. The successive incremental antagonism of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction by <b>mepyramine</b> and <b>mepyramine</b> plus indomethacin and FPL 55712 indicates that the predominant mediators involved are histamine and leukotrienes, respectively. The failure of indomethacin plus BW 755 C to inhibit the mepyramine-resistant bronchoconstriction {{provoked by}} OA macroshock may reflect the increased generation of leukotrienes via a 5 -lipoxygenase isoenzyme resistant to inhibition by BW 755 C.

Ovalbumin at 1 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1 i. v. caused a significant increase in microvascular leakage in the airways and at 3 [*]mg[*]kgâ 1 i. v. caused a significant increase in airways resistance.

Third ventricle injections of the H 1 and H 2 receptor antagonists, <b>mepyramine</b> (50, 100, 200 and 400 nmol) and cimetidine (100, 200 and 400 nmol), were unable to modify water intake induced by water deprivation and sodium depletion.

Antazoline (Antistin), chlorcyclizine and promethazine (Phenergan) increased the cardio-accelerator responses to both amines equally. <b>Mepyramine</b> (Anthisan) increased noradrenaline more than adrenaline action.

40|$|AbstractDifferent brain areas {{seem to be}} {{involved}} in the cardiovascular responses to stress. The medial amygdala (MeA) has been shown to participate in cardiovascular control, and acute stress activates the MeA to a greater extent than any of the other amygdaloid structures. It has been demonstrated that the brain histaminergic system may {{be involved}} in behavioral, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stressful situations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the histaminergic receptors H 1 and H 2 in cardiovascular responses to acute restraint stress. Wistar rats (280 â 320 g) received bilateral injections of cimetidine, <b>mepyramine</b> or saline into the MeA and were submitted to 45 min of restraint stress. <b>Mepyramine</b> microinjections at doses of 200, 100 and 50 nmol promoted a dose-dependent blockade of the hypertensive response induced by the restraint stress. Cimetidine (200 and 100 nmol) promoted a partial blockade of the hypertensive response to stress only at the highest dose administered. Neither drugs altered the typical stress-evoked tachycardiac responses. Furthermore, <b>mepyramine</b> and cimetidine were unable to modify the mean arterial pressure or heart rate of freely moving rats under basal conditions (non-stressed rats). The data suggest that in the MeA the histaminergic H 1 receptors appear to be more important than H 2 receptors in the hypertensive response to stress. Furthermore, there appears to be no histaminergic tonus in the MeA controlling blood pressure during non-stress conditions...|$|E
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of histamine (greater than 10 microM) contract rat aortic rings {{and the effect}} is greatly enhanced when the endothelium is removed. The present study was aimed at characterizing the histamine-induced contractions of de-endothelialized rat aortic rings. These contractions were poorly inhibited by the histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist, <b>mepyramine</b> (1 and 10 microM) and insensitive to the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist, cimetidine (10 microM), and to the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 microM). In contrast, the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, prasozin and pentholamine, antagonized these contractions in a concentration-dependent manner (respective apparent pKB values 9. 7 and 7. 9) and nifedipine (3 microM) reduced them by about 75 %. Pretreatment of de-endothelialized rings with 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP and of intact rings with methylene blue resulted in respective inhibition and enhancement of histamine-induced contractions, quite similarly to the effects in the presence {{and in the absence}} of endothelium, respectively. Histamine elicited endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings precontracted by prostaglandin F 2 alpha. This relaxation was abolished in the presence of <b>mepyramine</b> (1 microM). However, <b>mepyramine</b> failed to mimic the enhancing effect of endothelium removal on histamine-induced contractions of resting aortic rings. It is concluded that, in rat aorta, (1) contractions induced by high {{concentrations of}} histamine (greater than 10 microM) are probably mediated by alpha 1 -adrenoceptors; and (2) spontaneous, but not histamine-stimulated, release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is mainly involved in the modulation of histamine-induced contractions...|$|E

These responses were unaffected by atropine, <b>mepyramine</b> or bromolysergic acid diethylamide but were blocked by phentolamine or dihydroergotamine. Cocaine augmented the constriction responses to tyramine or noradrenaline but not those to adrenaline, acetylcholine or 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Infusion of noradrenaline restored the responses of preparations which had become tachyphylactic to tyramine...|$|E
40|$|Myofibroblasts play an {{important}} central role in wound contraction and repair, and are believed to develop from resident fibroblasts in the adjacent uninjured connective tissues. However, the factors involved in their differentiation into more contractile cells are not fully understood. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the role of histamine on the pharmacological responsiveness of both subcutaneous fascia and wound granulation tissues. In the present in vitro study, using superfusion technique, the effects of histamine (1, 10 and 50 ÂµM following 30 and 60 min incubation) on the pharmacological responsiveness of excisional wound granulation tissue were compared with superficial fascia to <b>mepyramine.</b> The results showed that incubation with histamine caused an increase in responsiveness of normal fascia to <b>mepyramine,</b> while it had no effect on excisional wound granulation tissue. In conclusion, it seems that histamine plays {{an important}} role in modulating the contractile behaviour of the normal fibroblasts and promotes the development of a more contractile cell resembling the myofibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|The {{contractile}} {{action of}} the dipeptide carnosine (Î²-alanyl-L-histidine), active as a ZnÂ·carnosine complex (ZnÂ·Carn), was investigated in isolated rings of rabbit saphenous vein (RSV) and {{was found to be}} antagonized by the H 1 antagonist <b>mepyramine.</b> Mepyramine-sensitive, histamine-induced contractures in RSV, were smaller (73 Â± 0. 1 %) and less well sustained than carnosine-induced contractures. Schild plot values for <b>mepyramine</b> antagonism were, for carnosine-induced contractures; pA 2 = 7. 97 Â± 0. 12, slope= 1. 33 Â± 0. 06 (r= 0. 793) and for histamine-induced contractures; pA 2 = 8. 48 Â± 0. 07, slope= 0. 63 Â± 0. 05, r= 0. 957). Serotonergic antagonists methiothepin and ketanserin, antagonize both carnosine- and histamine-induced contractures in RSV, probably reflecting coincidental inhibition at the H 1 -receptor. Carnosine, with Zn present, can inhibit the H 1 -specific binding of [3 H]-mepyramine to isolated guinea-pig cerebellar membranes (log IC 50 sâ 2. 78 Â± 0. 02, â 3. 93 Â± 0. 03 and â 4. 64 Â± 0. 03 at 10, 30 and 80 [*]Î¼M Zn respectively; values corrected for the Zn-specific inhibition which has a logIC 50 of â 4. 20). In the radioligand binding assay, the effect of carnosine can be described as a function of ZnÂ·Carn concentration with an apparent logIC 50 of â 5. 61. This value is consistent with that obtained from the functional studies on RSV. Histamine-induced contractures have an indomethacine-sensitive component (27. 2 Â± 8. 3 % of control response), not apparent with carnosine-induced contractures. Like histamine, carnosine evoked an H 2 -mediated (cimetidine-sensitive) relaxation in the presence of <b>mepyramine,</b> but was less potent (10. 8 Â± 3. 1 % residual tension at 10 [*]mM carnosine compared with 13. 4 Â± 7. 5 % at 0. 1 [*]mM histamine). Carnosine, like <b>mepyramine,</b> can 'reveal' the H 2 -mediated relaxation of histamine providing further evidence that carnosine binds at the H 1 receptor. We conclude that carnosine can act at the smooth muscle H 1 -receptor to provoke vasoconstriction and that it also has the potential to act at H 1 -receptors in CNS...|$|E
40|$|The central histaminergic nervous system, {{originating}} from the tuberomammillary {{nucleus of the}} hypothalamus, widely innervates almost the whole brain {{as well as the}} spinal cord. However, the effect of histamine on spinal motoneurons, the final common path for motor control, is still unknown. By using 8 - 14 -day-old rat spinal slice preparations and intracellular recordings, the effect of histamine on motoneurons in lumbar spinal cord and the underlying mechanisms were studied. Bath application of histamine (30 - 300 Î¼M) induced a membrane depolarization in the majority of recorded spinal motoneurons (78 / 90, 86 %). Perfusing slices with tetrodotoxin or low-Ca 2 +/high-Mg 2 + medium did not block the histamine-induced excitation, indicating a direct postsynaptic action of histamine on motoneurons. Separate application of the selective histamine H 1 receptor antagonist <b>mepyramine</b> or the selective histamine H 2 receptor antagonist ranitidine partially suppressed the histamine-induced excitation, whereas a combination of ranitidine and <b>mepyramine</b> totally blocked the excitatory effect of histamine on motoneurons. On the other hand, both the selective histamine H 1 receptor agonist 2 -pyridylethylamine and the selective histamine H 2 receptor agonist dimaprit mimicked the excitation of histamine on spinal motoneurons. These agonist-induced excitations were also blocked by <b>mepyramine</b> or ranitidine. Furthermore, histamine affected membrane input resistance and potentiated repetitive firing behavior of spinal motoneurons. These results demonstrate that histamine excites rat spinal motoneurons via the histamine H 1 and H 2 receptors and increases their excitability, suggesting that the hypothalamospinal histaminergic fibers may directly modulate final motor outputs and actively regulate ongoing motor execution andspinal motor reflexes.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of histamine-stimulated adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in slices of rabbit cerebral cortex have been investigated. The selective H 2 -receptor antagonists, cimetidine, tiotidine, metiamide and ranitidine appeared to antagonize the stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine {{in a competitive}} manner consistent with an interaction with histamine H 2 -receptors. The H 1 -receptor antagonist <b>mepyramine</b> (0. 8 microM) produced only a weak inhibition of the response to histamine. The inhibition appeared to be non-competitive producing {{a decrease in the}} maximal response with little effect on the EC 50 value. The specific H 2 -receptor agonist, impromidine, produced a maximum response of only 31 +/- 2 % of that obtained with histamine. Studies with histamine and impromidine in combination indicated that impromidine was not acting as a partial agonist. 2 -Thiazolylethylamine, a selective H 1 -agonist, produced only a weak response (EC 50 approximately 1 mM) yielding a relative potency with respect to histamine (= 100) of 2. 5. In the presence of a supramaximal concentration of impromidine, histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine further elevated the response to impromidine. In these conditions the relative potency of 2 -thiazolylethylamine was increased to 59 (histamine = 100), a value which was comparable with that reported for H 1 -receptor-mediated contractions of guinea-pig ileum. The H 1 -receptor antagonists <b>mepyramine,</b> promethazine, triprolidine and chlorpheniramine competitively antagonized the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine in rabbit cerebral cortex without affecting the response to impromidine alone. (+) -Chlorpheniramine was some 150 fold more potent than the (-) -isomer in this respect. Histamine and adenosine in combination had a much greater than additive effect on the accumulation of cyclic AMP in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. The potentiation of the adenosine response could be partially but not completely antagonized by either cimetidine or <b>mepyramine.</b> In the presence of H 2 -receptor blockade with 0. 02 mM tiotidine, histamine elicited a significant potentiation (EC 50 44 microM) of the response to adenosine. This response was antagonized competitively by <b>mepyramine</b> yielding a KB value of 0. 05 microM similar to that obtained from inhibition of the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP (0. 02 microM). These results suggest that there are two components in the response to histamine in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
