Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences. [...] Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum, and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{characteristic of the}} Gastropoda is the asymmetry of their principal organs. The essential feature of this asymmetry is that the anus generally lies {{to one side of}} the median plane.; The ctenidium (gill-combs), the osphradium (olfactory organs), the hypobranchial gland (or pallial <b>mucous</b> <b>gland),</b> and the auricle of the heart are single or at least are more developed on one side of the body than the other Furthermore, there is only one genital orifice, which lies on the same side of the body as the anus.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{specific}} allergen exposure {{leads to}} cross-bridging of IgE molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and {{release of a}} vast array of mediators. These mediators include histamine; leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4; and a host of cytokines. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and <b>mucous</b> <b>gland</b> secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the smooth muscles, edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause the airway hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia.|$|E
50|$|LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA44 {{are also}} high {{affinity}} antagonists of the Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 for which leukotrienes (LT) LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are agonists, i.e. the three leukotrienes bind to and thereby stimulate smooth muscle contraction, eosinophil chemotactaxis, <b>mucous</b> <b>gland</b> secretion, {{and various other}} pro-allergic responses in the cells of lung, skin, and other tissues. (CysLT1 and ATX/FPR2 have an amino acid sequence identity of 47%.) The ability of these LX's to block {{the actions of the}} three LTs may contribute to their ability to resolve allergic reactions; for example, LXA4 relaxes the smooth muscle contraction caused by the cysteinyl leukotrienes in the hamster cheek pouch assay and a metabolically resistant 15-epi-LXAA4 analog potently inhibits allergen-driven airway hypersensitivity and inflammation in a mouse model.|$|E
