5|$|Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch {{published}} {{a paper on}} early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. He found that although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and relatives were actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were the only true cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however that further work on the group <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> different conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggested}} {{effects of}} the impacts were seismic waves travelling across the planet, an increase in stratospheric haze on the planet due to dust from the impacts, {{and an increase in}} the mass of the Jovian ring system. However, given that observing such a collision was completely unprecedented, astronomers were cautious with their predictions of what the event <b>might</b> <b>reveal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model {{posits that}} {{elementary}} particles derive their masses from the Higgs mechanism, which is associated to the Higgs boson. It {{is hoped that}} further research into {{the reasons for the}} top quark's large mass of ~173GeV/c2, almost the mass of a gold atom, <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> more about the origin of the mass of quarks and other elementary particles.|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{were also}} raised {{that because the}} mobile version of Google Buzz by default {{published}} the user's exact location when they posted {{a message to the}} service, users <b>might</b> unintentionally <b>reveal</b> sensitive locations.|$|R
50|$|The SME {{generates a}} {{modified}} Dirac equationthat breaks Lorentz symmetryfor {{some types of}} particle motions, but not others.It therefore holds important informationabout how Lorentz violations might have been hiddenin past experiments,or <b>might</b> be <b>revealed</b> in future ones.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems that}} Alfred Potter quickly came under suspicion. PC Lomasney, the local {{policeman}} who knew Alfred and his wife, Lillian Elizabeth Potter, {{was asked to}} stay close to them to see what they <b>might</b> unwittingly <b>reveal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|At school, Peter is {{attacked}} {{with water}} balloons by Flash Thompson and his sidekick Kenny Kong, which he dodges until he realizes it <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> his secret identity as Spider-Man. Gwen steps in and gets everyone {{to laugh at}} Flash instead. Gwen and Peter go to the Connors lab and help Eddie clean up from a previous battle with Electro. Martha announces that Curt's arm had grown back and they celebrate until they realize scales are growing on his arm, determining that the reptilian half of his brain his taking over. Peter tries to comfort the Connors's son, Billy, but gets interrupted when Curt transforms into a hulking, humanoid lizard and runs off.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E
60|$|Among {{them came}} one whom Tarzan recognized, but so schooled was the ape-man {{in the control}} of his {{emotions}} that no slightest change of expression, much less any hysterical demonstration that <b>might</b> have <b>revealed</b> his presence, betrayed the fact of his inward excitement.|$|R
3000|$|... ‘Identifiable features’ (Polygnosis) can {{be aligned to}} ‘Physical Features’ (BBT’s hierarchy) under ‘Material Objects’ (BBT’s Facet).

6000|$|... 'O, not I--that is,' the milkwoman murmured, with a {{start of}} dismay. Again the dread seized her that {{something}} to do with her fierce act in the dream <b>might</b> be <b>revealed,</b> and her character {{in the eyes of the}} most useful friend she had ever had be ruined irretrievably.|$|R
5|$|Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} Pallas in 1802, {{the year}} after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.|$|E

25|$|Late in November 1941 {{it became}} {{apparent}} to the American Government that Japanese forces were tactically deposed for major operations in Southeast Asia, but their precise target was unknown. A large convoy was steaming south from the Formosa Straits, and {{it was hoped that}} learning the destination of these ships <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> Japan's intentions.|$|E
25|$|It is {{unlikely}} that this message was conveyed to the Pope, but the Bishop of Leiria suggested that she write her memoirs {{in the event that}} she <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her third memoir, written in 1941, Sister Lucia recalled that at the apparition of July 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary had first mentioned the consecration of Russia, and said that she would return to give particulars.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the book, Alford speaks with and visits a number of people over the age of seventy, some famous (playwright Edward Albee, actress Sylvia Miles, and {{literary}} critic Harold Bloom) and some offbeat (a Lutheran Pastor who thinks napping is a form of prayer; writer Sandra Tsing Loh's eccentric retired aerospace engineer father, who eats food out of the garbage), with the hopes that they <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> some kind of sagacity that they have accrued over their lengthy lifespan.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria {{encouraged}} Lúcia (now Sister Maria Lúcia das Dores) {{to write}} her memoirs, so that she <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her first memoir, published in 1935, focused on the holiness of Jacinta Marto. The deceased girl was by then popularly considered a saint. In her second memoir, published in 1937, Lucia wrote more about her own life, the apparition of 13 June 1917, and first reveals the earlier apparitions of the Angel of Peace.|$|E
25|$|He was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan in 2005 with SEAL Team Ten {{as part of}} SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One (SDV-1). While in Afghanistan, {{he was involved in}} Operation Red Wings, during which the four-man Special Reconnaissance element with SDV-1 was discovered by local herdsmen, subsequently ambushed, and all killed except Luttrell. Luttrell was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the operation. The team knew the local herdsmen <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> their whereabouts to Taliban fighters but, because they were not armed combatants, the team allowed the herdsmen to leave despite the risk to themselves and their mission.|$|E
25|$|Odell {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} which <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> something about the climb of Mallory and Irvine among the equipment in camps V and VI. In addition to Mallory's compass, which normally was a critical component for climbing activities, he discovered some oxygen bottles and spare parts. This situation suggests {{the possibility that there}} had been a problem with the oxygen equipment which might have caused a delayed start in the morning. A hand-generator electric lamp also remained in the tent – it was still in working order when it was found by the Ruttledge expedition nine years later.|$|E
60|$|Despite my shame, I dared, at last, {{to raise}} my eyes.

25|$|Note that brain {{electrical}} activity can stop completely, or drop {{to such a}} low level as to be undetectable with most equipment. An EEG will therefore be flat, though this is sometimes also observed during deep anesthesia or cardiac arrest. Although in the United States a flat EEG test {{is not required to}} certify death, it is considered to have confirmatory value. In the UK it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the Code of Practice criteria.|$|E
25|$|Being classically educated Englishmen, Grenfell and Hunt {{were mainly}} {{interested}} in the possibility that Oxyrhynchus <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> the lost masterpieces of classical Greek literature. They knew, for example, that the Constitution of Athens by Aristotle had been discovered on Egyptian papyrus in 1890. This hope inspired them and their successors to sift through the mountains of rubbish at Oxyrhynchus for the next century. Their efforts were amply rewarded: {{it has been estimated}} that over 70% of all the literary papyri so far discovered come from Oxyrhynchus, both copies of well-known standard works (many in versions significantly closer to the originals than those that had been transmitted in medieval manuscripts) and previously unknown works by the greatest authors of antiquity.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} increase in accuracy (to nearly ~80%) was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment; knowing the full distribution of amino acids that occur at a position (and in its vicinity, typically ~7 residues on either side) throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position. For illustration, a given protein might have a glycine at a given position, which by itself might suggest a random coil there. However, multiple sequence alignment <b>might</b> <b>reveal</b> that helix-favoring amino acids occur at that position (and nearby positions) in 95% of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution. Moreover, by examining the average hydrophobicity at that and nearby positions, the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an α-helix. Taken together, these factors {{would suggest that the}} glycine of the original protein adopts α-helical structure, rather than random coil. Several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3-state prediction, including neural networks, hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position.|$|E

30|$|Since the Epstein-Hurwitz zeta {{function}} {{is based on}} the theory of quadratic forms in euclidean spaces and the study of Minkowski [5], this fact might shed light on new mathematical aspects of the lattice theory besides [7]. Furthermore, since the SC lattice A_ 2 ^a can be regarded as the Gauss integers Z[√(- 1)], these results <b>might</b> also <b>reveal</b> an important connection between the number theory and the theory of dislocations.|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the spin {{dynamics}} in the charge-ordered stripe phase <b>might</b> be <b>revealing</b> {{with regards to the}} nature of the anomalous spin dynamics in cuprate superconductors.
