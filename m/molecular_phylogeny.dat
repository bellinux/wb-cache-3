5|$|From 1988 onwards {{analyses}} {{based on}} <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny,</b> which compares biochemical {{features such as}} similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods among the Lophotrochozoa, a protostome super-phylum that includes molluscs, annelids and flatworms but excludes the other protostome super-phylum Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods. This conclusion is unanimous among <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> studies, which use {{a wide selection of}} genes: rDNA, Hox genes, mitochondrial protein genes, single nuclear protein genes and sets of nuclear protein genes.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of relationships}} within the order {{is based on}} a 2002 <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> using ribosomal RNA, a nuclear elongation factor gene, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. The Annulipalpia and Integripalpia are clades, but the relationships within the Spicipalpia are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} {{was long}} neglected, {{the discovery of}} homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram. The Tungidae, including the harmful chigoe flea or jigger, is sister {{to the rest of}} the Siphonaptera.|$|E
5|$|Portia {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive. <b>Molecular</b> <b>phylogeny,</b> a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Portia {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Portia′s closest relatives are the genera Spartaeus, Phaeacius, and Holcolaetis.|$|E
5|$|This {{cladogram}} {{is based}} on Debevic et al, 2012, which used <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> {{to demonstrate that the}} bees (Anthophila) arose from deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic. The placement of the Heterogynaidae is uncertain. The small subfamily Mellininae was not included in their analysis.|$|E

40|$|Cladistic {{analysis}} of cranial and dental {{evidence has been}} widely used to generate phylogenetic hypotheses about humans and their fossil relatives. However, the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> for the groups. Given the robustness of the <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies,</b> {{these results indicate that}} little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence. The corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable. Accordingly, new approaches are required {{to address the problem of}} hominin phylogeny...|$|R
5|$|Phaeacius is {{a spider}} genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Phaeacius {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, which {{is thought to be}} primitive. <b>Molecular</b> <b>phylogeny,</b> a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Phaeacius {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Phaeacius′s closest relative is the genus Holcolaetis, and that the next closest are Portia and Spartaeus.|$|E

5|$|While {{analyses}} by <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> {{are confident}} that members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|E
5000|$|Long {{considered}} one of the more [...] "primitive" [...] species of Nepenthes, recent <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> have consistently placed N. pervillei in a basal position within the genus.|$|R
50|$|The Cercozoa are a {{group of}} {{single-celled}} eukaryotes. They lack shared morphological characteristics at the microscopic level, being defined by <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> of rRNA and actin or polyubiquitin.|$|R
50|$|Recent <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> {{has shown}} that the {{subgenus}} is polyphyletic. Section Pharmacosycea is a sister taxa {{to the rest of the}} genus Ficus, while section Oreosycea is itself polyphyletic.|$|R
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny.</b> Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relative}} of the choughs as indicated by a study of <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> is the ratchet-tailed treepie (Temnurus temnurus) and they form a clade that is sister to the remaining living members of the corvidae. The genus Pyrrhocorax species differ from Corvus in that they have brightly coloured bills and feet, smooth, not scaled tarsi and very short, dense nasal feathers. Choughs have uniformly black plumage, lacking any paler areas as seen in some of their relatives. The two Pyrrhocorax are the main hosts of two specialist chough fleas, Frontopsylla frontalis and F. laetus, not normally found on other corvids.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the genus}} Arabidopsis has nine species and a further eight {{subspecies}} recognised. This delimitation is quite recent {{and is based}} on morphological and <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> by O'Kane and Al-Shehbaz (1997, 2003) and others.|$|R
50|$|The tribe Indigofereae is a {{subdivision}} {{of the plant}} family Fabaceae. It is consistently recovered as a monophyletic clade in <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies.</b> The Indigofereae arose 30.0 ± 3.3 million years ago (in the Oligocene).|$|R

5|$|Nuthatch {{taxonomy}} is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted nuthatch has {{an appearance}} and contact call {{similar to those}} of the white-cheeked nuthatch, Sitta leucopsis, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant nuthatch (S. magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.|$|E
5|$|While all <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> {{studies and}} half the {{combined}} studies until 2008 conclude that brachiopods are lophotrochozoans, they could not identify which lophotrochozoan phylum were the closest relatives of brachiopods—except phoronids, which are a sub-group of brachiopods. However, in 2008 two analyses found that brachiopods' closest lophotrochozoan relatives were nemertines. The authors found this surprising, since nemertines have spiral cleavage {{in the early stages}} of cell division and form a trochophore larva, while brachiopods have radial cleavage and a larva that shows no sign of having evolved from a trochophore. Another study in 2008 also concluded that brachiopods are closely related to nemertines, casting doubt on the idea that brachiopods are part of a clade Lophophorata of lophophore-feeding animals within the lophotrochozoans.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E
50|$|Systematic classifications {{dealing with}} only extant taxa include all feliforms into the Feliformia suborder, though {{variations}} {{exist in the}} definition and grouping of families and genera.

50|$|The ADA clade is the earliest-branching {{monophyletic}} clade of {{the flowering}} plant subfamily Faboideae (or Papilionaceae). Evidence for this clade was sparse until recent <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> that included basal faboid genera that previously had been poorly sampled.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{fossil record}} {{typically}} exhibits very dynamic patterns of innovation, diversification and extinction. In contrast, <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> suggest smoother patterns of evolutionary change. Several new studies reconcile this difference and reveal {{more about the}} mechanisms behind macroevolutionary change...|$|R
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny.</b> The sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|The multi-genus {{approach}} is {{based solely on}} the structure of the male flowers; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another. Four of the genera—Attalea (in a narrow sense), Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea—correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus. However, a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types, including A.colenda (which Glassman placed in its own genus, Ynesa) and this has been used as an argument for the single-genus approach. In addition, there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman's five-genus system, which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus. In 2009 Alan Meerow and colleagues published a <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny</b> of the subtribe which found that some species placed in Orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in Scheelea than they were to other members of that genus (if the five-genus approach was used), while A.crassispatha, placed in Orbignya by Glassman, was actually a sister to both Scheelea and Orbignya.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians {{is a matter of}} debate. A 2005 <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogeny,</b> based on rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils. There are large gaps in the fossil record, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates. Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of using <b>molecular</b> <b>phylogenies</b> to resolve {{relationships}} of many protists the original circumscription of bicosoecids has been greatly expanded upon to include other orders and the rank has changed from an order to a class.|$|R
