40|$|Abstract: According to {{the concept}} of {{distributed}} cognition or distributed intelligence (Pea, 1993; Wertsch, 1995), which is popular in current theories on learning, intelligence is not a property of individual minds. Instead it is achieved through the resources distributed in soci-ety: between people, and also between people, physical tools, and symbolic systems. Build-ing on this perspective, people can achieve very complex goals through distributed cogni-tion. When schools engage in joint projects with members of the community, many examples of socially distributed intelligence emerge; moreover, when people interact in more egali-tarian ways, using this kind of collective intelligence, both the processes and the results are much more effective. This article describes various ways that distributed cognition functions in four schools in Spain that are being studied within the INCLUD-ED integrated research project. This type of organisation in these schools is reflected in two key practices: <b>mixed</b> <b>committees</b> and interactive groups in the classroom. Evidence of the pedagogical benefits of this approach is also provided. Key words: Distributed cognition in community-based education, Interactive Groups, <b>mixed</b> <b>committees...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{most of the}} {{legislative}} tasks of the European Parliament(EP) are performed in its committees, it is controversial how representative they are of the overall plenary.

These propositions are examined via {{a representative sample of}} committees using an original data set of MEPs' profiles in the 6 th European Parliament.

The components employed as excipients must present the characteristics required by their technological function but, as with any substance administered to man, they must also correspond to suitable safety requirements. In fact, in the past the importance of evaluating the possible adverse effects of excipients was underestimated, because their inertia and innocuity were taken for granted. The safety profile of these substances is more deeply researched as regards the toxicological aspect only if they are also employed in the food industry (anti-oxidants, sweeteners, colouring agents, etc.). Indeed, in this case, the International Toxicological Committees (among which the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, a <b>mixed</b> <b>committee</b> of the WHO/FAO) demand thorough studies in laboratory animals, with the intent of protecting the consumer’s safety. Tackling the question of the toxicity of excipients thoroughly is not a simple matter for several reasons: the large number of substances on the market and the diversity of their chemical profiles, their sources, their technological functions, and the presence of secondary products and/or contaminants that may be the true causes of adverse effects.
