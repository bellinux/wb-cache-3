40|$|We examine basic issues <b>of</b> <b>glossary</b> tools {{as part of}} a {{suite of}} annotational tools to help users make meaning from {{documents}} from unfamiliar realms of discourse. We specifically evaluated the performance <b>of</b> <b>glossary</b> tools for reading medical information about common diseases by users with no formal medical education. We developed both automatic and an editable <b>glossary</b> tools. Both <b>of</b> them extracted definitions from the text of articles. Only the editable glossary tool allowed users to add, delete, and change entries. Both tools were evaluated to find out how useful they were to users reading technical articles online. The analytical results showed that user performance improved without increasing total reading time. The glossary tools were effective and pleasing to users at no decrease in efficiency. This experiment points the way for longer-term studies with adaptable tools, particularly to help users unfamiliar with technical documents. We also discuss the rôle <b>of</b> <b>glossaries</b> as part <b>of</b> a suite of annotational tools to help users make personal (and therefore meaningful) hypertextual document collections...|$|R
