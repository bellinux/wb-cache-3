Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Nanofiltration (NF) processes are commonly used desalination technologies. Studies of hybrid RO-NF <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> systems have shown promising benefits of lower power usage, higher overall obtainability, and better water quality. Under the proposed title, a systematic network synthesis approach is to be developed to evaluate {{the performance of a}} hybrid <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> plant consisting of NF and RO processes in order to achieve an optimal design network for a given water capacity with ideal operating conditions. This work is done using a superstructure optimization, while taking into account desired process conditions and constraints that are associated with the hybrid RO-NF system. The superstructure captures all the structural and operational options that enable the extraction of a global optimal design, giving a better visualization of the hybrid design network. The optimization problem is formulated while accounting for all the design decisions that are supported by superstructure representation, based on numbers and types of units, flow rates, and pressures. An economic objective function is utilized so as to provide an efficient and desirable configuration capturing all the significant capital and operating costs, such as intake, pre and post treatment, along with the revenue from the value extraction.

30|$|Fouling is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} {{that is difficult to}} define and a major problem faced by desalination industries employing membrane separation processes. Generally fouling is the undesirable deposition or accumulation of solids on the membrane surface. Fouling inhibits flow through the membrane resulting in an eventual decline in overall flux, poor permeate quality, higher pressure demand (higher energy), additional labor for maintenance and chemicals for cleaning, production loss and shorter membrane life. Usually, reverse osmosis (RO) <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> industries employ two different strategies to combat fouling. The first one is prevention, which is accomplished by supplying high-quality feed water to the membranes. However, conventional pretreatment (coagulation/filtration) or even the advanced membrane (MF/UF) pretreatment processes which are used to attain the desired level of feed water quality are not capable of preventing fouling completely. The second strategy is to clean the membrane chemically to remove foulants from the membrane surface. SWRO <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> industries mainly use chemicals, such as alkalis, acids, metal chelating agents, enzymes and detergents, which are expensive and potentially harmful to the environment. Hence, RO desalination industries need an alternative environmentally friendly and cost-effective method to control fouling/scaling.|$|E

40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} desalination technologies used in the world. It provides high water quality for numerous applications and it demonstrates excellent desalination efficiency. One of the most troubling drawbacks of <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> is membrane fouling. It decreases the performance of the membranes and increases the energy requirement. Two of the most important causes of fouling are microbes and organic matter. Hence, to maintain an optimized desalination performance, routine inspection of microbial and organic contents of water is crucial for desalination plants. In this study, water samples were obtained from different treatment points in an ultrafiltration (UF) /nanofiltration (NF) seawater desalination pilot plant. This was performed to better understand how the water quality changes along the desalination scheme. The effect of fouling control techniques, including Chemically Enhanced Backwash (CEB), Cleaning in Place (CIP), and the addition of a biocide (DBNPA) was studied. Different analytical tools were applied, including Bactiquant, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC), and Liquid Chromatography for Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD).

Monitoring and controlling the affecting parameters are critical to {{the evaluation of the}} performance of the desalination plant, which will help the operator find and resolve problems immediately. Therefore, this paper was aimed at developing an RO unit by utilizing a wireless sensor network (WSN) system. Hence, an RO pilot plant with a feed capacity of 1. 2 m 3 /h was utilized, commissioned, and tested in Kuwait to assess and verify the performance of the integrated WSN in RO <b>membrane</b> <b>desalination</b> system.
