40|$|The recent {{urban growth}} of Florence was mainly {{oriented}} northward, thus determining the urbanization of the flatland and the inclusion within a unique conurbation {{of a number}} of pre-existing urban nuclei. Over time, the congestion of the inner core has caused more and more prominent activities to shift towards this developing area, which is today one of the most attractive parts of the whole settlement, counterbalancing the representativeness and the touristic attractiveness of the historic center of Florence. This paper is concerned with the use of space syntax in order to reconstruct the genesis of the configurational geography of Florence. Configurational values at different dates will be cross-referenced with vehicular traffic data, so as to pinpoint the actual inclusion of the motorway A 1, touching Florence on its western side, within the urban grid of Florence and its influence in the distribution of local traffic flows. Aside from this case study, this method can be extended to the general issue of the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> in metropolitan areas. More in general, this approach is proposed as a suitable tool for interconnecting spatial issues and traffic questions, so as to concur in bridging the gap between urban design, focused on the morphologic features of blocks and buildings, and transport analysis, strictly concerned with the distribution of movement flows on the street network...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAustralian States {{have been}} {{investing}} heavily in managed motorway. It was acknowledged {{some time ago}} that the motorways that had slow moving congested traffic caused a considerable loss of value to the community. The concept of Productivity was applied to Motorways and since become a key performance indicator used to rate different motorway systems. The approach to motorway management {{has been based on}} established practices overseas although different algorithms are being developed in Australia and subsequently evaluated. This paper describes the processes used by Australian States to manage motorways and it describes the current research into new techniques. The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> cannot be undertaken without consideration of the urban arterial network. It is therefore important to see the network as a whole noting that drivers tend to change their routes so that both the motorways and the arterial work in unison to provide the level of service to the user. It is therefore important that the performance of the arterial road system be maximised. The paper outlines some of the research that is directed at maximising the arterial road, using detectors on the departure side of signalized intersections to evaluating the potential for significant improvement in signal re-timing. Finally the paper will outline the use of the Highway Capacity Manual in Australian traffic engineering practices. It should be understood that Australia has used SIDRA for intersection analysis for some time and although many of the concepts of the HCM are used in SIDRA, it contains many elements and calibration factors that are peculiar to Australia...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the travel time along a motorway section, both in undisturbed condition and taking into account a perturbation due to an accident. The estimated travel time is calculated adding the travel time under normal traffic conditions, the time used settling the accident area and the time needed to dissolve the queue. To be applied the model requires the knowledge of accident characteristics, the traffic flow at the accident time and the value of the reduced capacity during the accident management. The model refers to traffic conditions and accident <b>management</b> procedures typical <b>of</b> <b>motorways...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Highways Agency’s {{original}} CCTV {{system or}} Highways Agency Surveillance CCTV system was used primarily {{to assist the}} police with the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> traffic on <b>motorway</b> and trunk roads. It was typically formed out {{of a number of}} smaller networks working in isolation. Each of these small networks consisted of between 10 and 100 cameras that provided images to a single control room and had little provision for third parties. These networks often required a specific manufacturer’s camera, restricting the Highways Agency’s control over technology and cost.|$|R
40|$|Italy is the nation, in Europe and {{the rest}} of the world, with the {{greatest}} tradition and experience in the construction and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorway</b> infrastructure financed through the tolling system. Accordingly, our country has faced many of the problems and issues that are today of current interest in the European Community well before other countries have, availing itself of professional help both from the motorway sector as well as from the academic one. This professional help is not only based on abstract theories but rather on experience that has been acquired on the field. It thus seems only natural that Aiscat, in representation of the operators <b>of</b> the Italian <b>motorway</b> network in concession, should have commissioned a report on the external costs of transport, a subject which, further to its inclusion in European directive no. 2006 / 38, and the deadlines set by the European Parliament, has become of current interest; no longer therefore only a matter of academic discussion, but rather an important element and parameter of assessment for European Transport Policy. Although representing the motorway sector, Aiscat has taken into consideration the valuable indications provided by the European Authorities concerning the need of not limiting the analysis to external costs vis-à-vis individual modes of transport but rather coherently analyse these modes in terms of mobility and transport as a whole. Based on the above understanding and approach, this report has been prepared with the support of Prometeia- a highly qualified research and consulting firm-, and the contribution of export researchers whose background and skills guarantee the rigour and depth of analysis that were the key to this work from the very outset. I am therefore pleased and honoured to make this report available to all those who shall take part in establishing a common position on the subject, and trust that this contribution may help deal with all open issues in an analytical and rigorous manner, as should rightly be expected for all projects destined to affect the future of Europe and its people...|$|R

Admits that the influence of inscriptions is hard to separate from their context of changing industrial and market conditions but concludes that they can help to subjugate and subjectify employees, facilitate the use of metaphors and shift power/knowledge relationships.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the network <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> in Azerbaijan, the organization of operation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> is still not fully modernized. Currently, more than sixty regional units across the country are responsible for the maintenance of the entire road network. These units carry out their duties equally on main, regional and local roads. The modern way <b>of</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> requires a different approach with the specific procedures and regulation of relations for this type of network. Based on existing organization and capacity, as well as institutional changes/strengthening of the Agency for State Roads, it was found that operators from the public sector can provide maintenance <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> in a certain period. Such a proposal must be accompanied by organizational changes in terms of reduction of existing units through the establishment of specialized regional units for maintenance <b>of</b> <b>motorways</b> that will be responsible for longer sections/sectors of about 200 - 300 km. This paper presents an analysis of the necessary capacity to maintain the motorway network in Azerbaijan, and estimate of the total costs for setting up new units for maintenance <b>of</b> <b>motorways...</b>|$|R
