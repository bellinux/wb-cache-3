25|$|The {{sex ratio}} of a newborn infant (between {{male and female}} births) in {{mainland}} China reached 117:100, and stabilized between 2000 and 2013, substantially higher than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990. According {{to a report by}} the National Population and Family Planning Commission, there will be 30million <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated emigration.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> {{for a limited}} number of jobs, more men, in {{absolute}} terms, are excluded from formal employment. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger percentage of those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.|$|E
40|$|It {{may seem}} that booty calls serve <b>men</b> <b>more</b> so <b>than</b> <b>women.</b> After all, <b>men</b> desire sex <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> – a notion often rationalised by the lower {{biological}} cost of sex to men, compared to women. However, if booty calls favour <b>men</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> why might women {{be inclined to}} entertain calls for casual sex? Psychology professor Norman Li believes that booty calls should be looked upon as more than just sex; that it is, in fact, a strategy employed by both sexes in negotiating between their needs...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{explanations}} for this {{high proportion of}} female Somali-born immigrants have been advanced. The IPPR suggests {{that it might be}} due to <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> being killed in the Somali Civil War, leaving women as refugees, that some Somali men have left Britain for work in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, where their employment prospects are better, and also that some Somali men have left the UK in order to return to Somaliland, whilst their families stay behind to enable the completion of education. The civil war in Somalia resulted in a change in the composition of the Somali population in the UK. Prior to the 1980s, it was primarily composed of single seamen; {{as a result of the}} war it became a refugee community with an increased proportion of women and children.|$|E
25|$|Based in {{a survey}} with about 10,000 respondents, IFOP {{estimated}} that 90% of French people are heterosexual, 3% identify as bisexual, and 4% consider themselves homosexual. Two percent say they have not embraced a definition for their sexuality, and 1% {{did not wish to}} respond. More women than men are heterosexual (93% v. 86%), whereas <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> identify as homosexual (7% v. 1%) {{and to a lesser extent}} bisexual (4% v. 2%). A homosexual or bisexual identity was more common in people aged 18–49 (9%) than among those aged 50–64 (6%) or over 65 (4%). More singles than people in relationships identified as homo- or bisexual (11% v. 6%). An LGB identity is also more common among people who said they have had more than 10 sex partners or none at all compared to those who have had intermediary levels of sexual experience. Catholics are more likely to identify as heterosexual (91%) than people who said they had some other religion or no religion whatsoever (88% each).|$|E
25|$|After {{a writer}} told Hubbard in 1877 that far <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> had emigrated from England {{and that there}} were many {{opportunities}} for women in the British colonies, she became interested in promoting emigration. She then began advocating emigration as an option for indigent women and published information about emigration to Australia in The Women's Gazette. Hubbard proceeded to publish several articles about emigration in The Woman's Gazette and Work and Leisure, which drew the attention of several other emigration activists. The largest established emigration society for women in London at that time often tried to discourage applicants from emigration. In 1880, Hubbard established the Women's Emigration Society in order to promote and facilitate emigration. The group initially focused on emigration to Canada, but later expanded to New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. Most women sought to become governesses or helpers for families. Emigration was also promoted as a way for single women to find husbands. The society often worked with branches of the YWCA and local bishops in the locations that they sought to place women. The leadership of the society later encountered organisational difficulties and folded in 1884.|$|E
50|$|In {{modern times}} this rule has been criticised as being <b>more</b> {{accurate}} for <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> and for allowing a greater maximum age for a woman's partner later {{in her life}} than is actually socially acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{to assault}} is <b>more</b> common for <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women,</b> and {{most common in}} the 20-24 age bracket. Assault is most common {{in a public place}} and in most cases the {{perpetrator}} is unknown to the victim.|$|R
50|$|The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China {{has many}} <b>more</b> young <b>men</b> <b>than</b> young <b>women,</b> and this {{disparity}} {{is expected to}} increase. In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.|$|R
25|$|In 1789, whites {{numbered}} 40,000; mulattoes {{and free}} blacks, 28,000; and black slaves, an estimated 452,000. The lowest class of society was enslaved blacks, who outnumbered whites and free {{people of color}} {{by a margin of}} over six to one. The slave population on the island totaled almost half of the one million slaves in the Caribbean by 1789. Two thirds were African-born, and they tended to be less submissive than those born in the Americas. The death rate in the Caribbean exceeded the birth rate, so imports of enslaved Africans were necessary to maintain the numbers required to work the plantations. The slave population declined {{at an annual rate of}} two to five percent, due to overwork, inadequate food and shelter, insufficient clothing and medical care, and an imbalance between the sexes, with <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women.</b> Some slaves were of a creole elite class of urban slaves and domestics, who worked as cooks, personal servants and artisans around the plantation house. This relatively privileged class was chiefly born in the Americas, while the under-class born in Africa labored hard, and more often than not, under abusive and brutal conditions.|$|E
500|$|The one-child policy (Family Planning Program) and sex-selective {{abortions in}} China {{have caused a}} growing disproportion in the country's gender balance. Since 1979, when the one-child policy was introduced, {{approximately}} 20 million <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> have been born, or 120 males to 100 females born, and by 2020, China {{is expected to have}} 24 million <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women.</b> The global average is 103 males to 107 females.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2005, Harvard University President Lawrence Summers sparked {{controversy}} when, at an NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce, he made comments {{suggesting the}} lower {{numbers of women}} in high-level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women. He noted the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) on tests of cognitive abilities, leading to proportionally <b>more</b> <b>men</b> <b>than</b> <b>women</b> at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions.
