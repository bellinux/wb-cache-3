It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E

Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
25|$|Some of Ron's qualities {{serve as}} foils to Harry. While Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron {{comes from a}} loving but poor family; many of his {{possessions}} are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Finally, Ron is the most mediocre of his siblings, being (as of the first book) neither an excellent Quidditch player, a noteworthy student, nor the daughter his <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> wanted. All of these factors combined cause Ron to feel insecure; Ron's inferiority complex and his need to prove himself, is {{the main thrust of}} his character arc.|$|E

The baptismal register, prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as [...] "innkeeper" [...] and [...] "spinner" [...] respectively. [...] Additionally, it lists Verdi as being [...] "born yesterday", but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October.

Beatrice was brought up to stay with her <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> and she soon resigned herself to her fate. Queen Victoria was so set against her youngest daughter marrying that she refused to discuss the possibility. Nevertheless, many suitors were put forward, including Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial, the son of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France, and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, the widower of Beatrice's older sister Alice.

500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E

[...] "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour." [...] On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: [...] " [...] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption." [...] Despite reality, their mother maintained that they were middle-class.
