40|$|Abstract: Most shaping {{processes}} for ceramics {{are based on}} a powder technological moulding process using a negative mould and subsequent thermal compaction. Especially for prototypes and small-lot series of microcomponents, the outlay for moulds is the major costing factor. Therefore the use of rapid prototyping (RP) processes can decisively reduce the costs and time in product development of ceramic microcomponents. By combining the high resolution of, for example, stereolithography as an inexpensive and fast supply for <b>master</b> <b>models</b> with the high exibility of low-pressure injection moulding, a rapid prototyping process chain (RPPC) has been established for the fabrication of micropatterned ceramic components as functional models or pre-production lots. This RPPC proved to have a very high moulding precision and accuracy in the submillimetre range, but also enables the fabrication of components with outer dimensions of several centimetres. Different RP techniques were investigated with regard to their suitability to be used as <b>master</b> <b>models</b> in the replication chain. The quality of the <b>master</b> <b>models</b> turned out to be of decisive signicance for the quality and reproducibility of the ceramic mouldings...|$|R
40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s {{engineering}} companies {{rely heavily}} on an engineer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to use computers to analyze and optimize designs. With this use of computers in the design process, products undergo multiple design iterations between preliminary concept and final form. This in turn results in Computer Aided Design (CAD) models being passed from one discipline to the next. In attempts to keep consistency within the design process, an industry wide shift towards the use of CAD <b>master</b> <b>models</b> is taking place. With this change to <b>master</b> <b>models,</b> manufacturing and engineering development companies are attempting to more fully employ the use of parametrics in their initial CAD models. This is in hopes that the initial models handed downstream are robust enough to be used throughout the entire design loop. Unfortunately, current parameter definitions are often not robust enough to incorporate all the design changes from the various analyses and manufacturing operations. To address this problem, we present a more robust parametric methodology that broadens the current definition of parametrics as currently employed on CAx <b>master</b> <b>models</b> within CAD packages...|$|R
