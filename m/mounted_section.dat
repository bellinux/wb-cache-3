There were seven Constables wearing a white sash and gaiters, two Sergeants, two Inspectors and the Chief Constable. (Wearing gaiters and spurs.) Before the War there were only three or four mounted men. All the horses were stabled in the yard which was big enough for them and motor cars as well as Police parades. The <b>mounted</b> <b>section</b> lasted until 1944, when the number were reduced to four again, the last horses were named Pilot, Portia, Peter and Paul.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Evans was approached to join the newly founded Intelligence Corps, having been identified as a good candidate {{as a result of his}} year spent in Germany after graduating from Oxford. He initially joined the <b>mounted</b> <b>section</b> of the Corps, but was injured in a motorcycle accident in France in September 1914. In February 1915 he was attached to No. 3 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps an observer. The squadron was the first to use aerial photography to record details of enemy positions with observers, such as Evans, taking images at low altitudes, often whilst under fire. In September 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross for continuing to observe whilst his aircraft was under attack from an enemy plane and was also Mentioned in Dispatches.|$|E

40|$|Procurement {{of fresh}} tissue of {{prostate}} cancer is critical for biobanking and generation of xenograft models as an important preclinical step towards new therapeutic strategies in advanced prostate cancer. However, handling of fresh radical prostatectomy specimens has been notoriously challenging given the distinctive physical properties of prostate tissue and the difficulty to identify cancer foci on gross examination. Here, we have developed a novel approach using ceramic foam plates for processing freshly cut whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> from radical prostatectomy specimens without compromising further diagnostic assessment. Forty-nine radical prostatectomy specimens were processed and sectioned from the apex to the base in whole mount slices. Putative carcinoma foci were morphologically verified by frozen section analysis. The fresh whole mount slices were then laid between two ceramic foam plates and fixed overnight. To test tissue preservation after this procedure, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence, and silver in situ hybridization (FISH and SISH, respectively). There were no morphological artifacts on H&E stained whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> from slices that had been fixed between two plates of ceramic foam, and the histological architecture was fully retained. The quality of immunohistochemistry, FISH, and SISH was excellent. Fixing whole mount tissue slices between ceramic foam plates after frozen section examination is an excellent method for processing fresh radical prostatectomy specimens, allowing for a precise identification and collection of fresh tumor tissue without compromising further diagnostic analysis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Transitional cell {{carcinoma}} (TCC) of the prostate/prostatic urethra {{is a risk}} factor for urethral recurrence after radical cystoprostatectomy for TCC. Using conventional sectioning techniques, prostate involvement (prostatic urethra, acini, ducts and/ or stroma) has been detected in a range of 10 - 20 % of the patients, whereas transversal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning</b> has revealed 43 % prostate involvement in two reported series. Due to different mechanisms of prostate involvement (intraurethral, extravesical and direct overgrowth into the prostatic stroma), preoperative transurethral biopsies of the prostate might not accurately determine such involvement. In this study we examine the prostate using a longitudinal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning</b> technique, correlate TCC of the prostate with the characteristics of the bladder tumour and, thus, validate the preoperative transurethral resection biopsies. Material and methods: Patients scheduled for cystoprostatectomy or cystoprostatourethrectomy were investigated by preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra and mapping of the bladder. The cystectomy specimen was fixated with the bladder filled with formalin, and the prostate and bladder neck examined using longitudinal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning.</b> Results: In 13 of the 43 (30 %), patients TCC was identified in the prostate. Of these 13 patients, 9 had been identified in the preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra. Of the patients with prostatic involvement, 46 % had carcinoma in situ (Cis) in the bladder neck/trigone and 38 % had multifocal Cis in the bladder. Comparing this to the group of patients without prostatic involvement, the respectively figures are 20 % and 23 %. A tumour in the trigone, either invasive or Cis, was detected in 5 / 13 patients with prostatic involvement as compared to one patient (3 %) without TCC of the prostate. Multiple bladder tumours were more common in patients with prostatic involvement and were larger (3. 2 cm compared to 2. 2 cm). Conclusions: Preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra do not always detect TCC in the prostate. Cis in the bladder neck/trigone or multifocal and multiple bladder tumours could be risk factors for prostate involvement of TCC...|$|R
