5|$|Arsenal was {{the first}} British side to defeat Real Madrid and Juventus away from home. The club {{was also the first}} to win against both <b>Milanese</b> teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten {{consecutive}} clean sheets in the run-in to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final; the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Against Hamburg in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 13 September 2006, Arsenal became the first team in the competition's history to field a first eleven of different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|Haddock {{has been}} trying to get the local stonemason to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. <b>Milanese</b> opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore {{presents}} Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Marcello Lippi, Roberto Bettega and Umberto Agnelli {{announced}} that Baggio no longer featured in their plans at Juventus {{and decided to}} focus on the emerging star Alessandro Del Piero, who would inherit Baggio's number 10 shirt. Baggio faced difficulties with Agnelli, Luciano Moggi and Juventus management during his final season, as they stated they would only renew his contract if he reduced his salary by 50%. After strong pressure from A.C. Milan chairman Silvio Berlusconi and manager Fabio Capello, Baggio was sold to the <b>Milanese</b> club for £6.8million, amidst several protests from Juventus fans. At the time, Baggio had been linked with Internazionale, Real Madrid and English Premier League clubs Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} side, the first chapel was {{dedicated}} to the Nativity of Mary. Since 1573 this chapel, the giuspatronato of the <b>Milanese</b> Carcano family, contained the stone reportedly used for Isaac's sacrifice. A Ricci painting {{of the birth of}} Mary was on its altar; on its vault were the Four Evangelists, and its walls were decorated with frescoes. The second chapel, dedicated to San Giacomo, had a statue (later replaced by a painting) of the saint above the altar and was the burial place for members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. The third chapel, dedicated to the Crucifixion, contained a large sculpture of Christ on the cross.|$|E
5|$|The first entity {{to use the}} Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, which supplanted Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours {{chosen by}} the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the {{recently}} conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of the uniform of the <b>Milanese</b> civic guard. During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of equal size, clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.|$|E
5|$|To the <b>Milanese,</b> Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza {{would be far more}} dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The <b>Milanese</b> in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E
5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this <b>Milanese</b> artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{have won}} two European honours: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1994. They also reached {{the final of}} the UEFA Cup in 2000, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006. Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set {{numerous}} records in the competition. Between 1998–99 and the current season, 2016–17, they participated in nineteen successive seasons, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both <b>Milanese</b> teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi also {{received}} commissions from other Italian states {{and from their}} communities in Venice. These included, for the <b>Milanese</b> community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda based on an episode from Torquato Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata. In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, {{for a series of}} works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{pre-season}} {{began on}} 8 July with {{two days of}} medical tests. Benfica's first training session was held two days later, nine days before their first pre-season match with Estoril. After a draw with Estori, the club lost Guadiana Trophy matches to Blackburn Rovers and Sporting CP. That week Benfica made more squad adjustments, paying €5million for 18-year old Sidnei and releasing Petit after six years with the club. Early in August, Benfica won the Cidade de Guimarães Trophy against Paris Saint-Germain and Vitória de Guimarães, drawing with the former and defeating the latter. Before their presentation match with Feyenoord, Benfica signed Spanish winger José Antonio Reyes in a €2.6 million loan deal. In the match with Feyenoord, Óscar Cardozo scored the winning goal for Benfica. The club ended its preparation for the season against Inter Milan on 15 August in the new Eusébio Cup. After a goalless draw in regular time, the <b>Milanese</b> won on penalties.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the <b>Milanese</b> and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of winning the closely contested Italian Championship of 1985–86, {{the rest of the}} 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the <b>Milanese</b> clubs, Milan and Internazionale, won Italian championships. However, Juventus did win a Coppa Italia-UEFA Cup double in 1990 under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff. In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 World Cup. Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world record transfer fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the UEFA Cup in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Julius, humiliated by {{the failure}} of the Imperial invasion, turned to Louis XII of France (who, having been left in {{possession}} of Milan after the Second Italian War, was interested in further expansion into Italy) with an offer of alliance. In mid-March, the Republic provided a pretext for an attack on itself by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza (an act in keeping with prevailing custom, though Julius considered it a personal provocation); the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire and Ferdinand I of Spain concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining Istria, would receive Verona, Vicenza, Padua and the Friuli; France would annex Brescia, Crema, Bergamo and Cremona to its <b>Milanese</b> possessions; Ferdinand would seize Otranto; and the remainder, including Rimini and Ravenna, would be added to the Papal States.|$|E
5|$|Michael Dokeianos {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 1040, as protospatharios and doux, {{when he was}} sent to southern Italy to assume command of the local Byzantine province as Catepan of Italy. Prior to that, he was apparently a member of George Maniakes' expeditionary force sent to conquer Sicily in 1038. Dokeianos arrived in the mainland in November 1040, and the situation he found was critical: his predecessor Nikephoros Dokeianos, probably a relative, had been killed in January at Ascoli in a mutiny of his troops, which was followed by a revolt in Taranto and the capture of the capital, Bari, by Argyrus, son of the Lombard leader Melus. Dokeianos hanged or blinded the ringleaders of the various revolts, but he failed to address the underlying cause, the widespread resentment at the oppressive taxation imposed by the Empire as part of the preparations for the Sicilian expedition under Maniakes. Dokeianos also offered the rule of strategic fortress of Melfi to the <b>Milanese</b> mercenary Arduin, with the title of topoteretes. Arduin had served under previous Byzantine commanders as part of a Norman contingent, but had been flogged in a dispute about the distribution of booty taken from the Muslims in Sicily (William of Apulia claims this was done by Dokeianos, but it is possible that it was done by one of his predecessors, perhaps George Maniakes). Arduin's grudge against the Byzantines now bore fruit. He sought the aid of the Normans who had been established at nearby Aversa since 1030, and received a contingent of 300 men, upon a promise to share his gains equally with them. Thus in March 1041 he and his men seized Melfi. The inhabitants initially opposed him, but eventually were won over by Arduin.|$|E
25|$|Micheletto's Venetian knights {{blocked the}} <b>Milanese</b> vanguard {{on the only}} bridge over the channel {{protecting}} the League's camp. Micheletto and the Venetians held the bridge allowing {{the greater part of}} the League's army to form for battle but were eventually pushed back by <b>Milanese</b> reinforcements led by the two captains Francesco Piccinino and Astorre II Manfredi. The <b>Milanese</b> advanced but their right flank was soon ferociously engaged by the Papal troops and were obliged to retreat to the bridge. The battle continued for four hours, until a surrounding manoeuvre managed to cut off a third of the <b>Milanese</b> on the League side of the channel. The battle continued into the night but ended with a victory for the League army.|$|E
25|$|The numerically {{superior}} <b>Milanese</b> {{force was}} led by the famous condottiero Niccolò Piccinino {{in the name of}} Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and reached the area on the night of 28 June. Some 2,000 men from the nearby town of Sansepolcro joined the <b>Milanese.</b> Confident in his superior manpower, and on the element of surprise Piccinino ordered an attack in the afternoon of the following day. However, the dust lifted by the <b>Milanese</b> on the Sansepolcro-Anghiari road was noticed by Micheletto and the League's forces were made ready for battle.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most cities}} in Italy, Milan has {{developed}} its own local culinary tradition, which, {{as it is}} typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than vegetable oil and features almost no tomato or fish. <b>Milanese</b> traditional dishes includes cotoletta alla <b>milanese,</b> a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese Wiener Schnitzel). Other typical dishes are cassoeula (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with Savoy cabbage), ossobuco (braised veal shank served with a condiment called gremolata), risotto alla <b>milanese</b> (with saffron and beef marrow), busecca (stewed tripe with beans), and brasato (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).|$|E

25|$|Banks {{throughout}} Italy {{went through}} many {{changes in the}} late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the <b>Milanese</b> banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and {{would have had to}} go bankrupt without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria <b>Milanese.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1431, after {{a period}} during which he fought again for the Papal States, he led the <b>Milanese</b> army against Venice; the {{following}} year the duke's daughter, Bianca Maria, was betrothed to him. Despite these moves, the wary Filippo Maria never ceased to be distrustful of Sforza. The allegiance of mercenary leaders was dependent, of course, on pay; in 1433-1435, Sforza led the <b>Milanese</b> attack on the Papal States, but when he conquered Ancona, in the Marche, he changed sides, obtaining the title of vicar of the city directly from Pope Eugene IV. In 1436-39, he served variously both Florence and Venice.|$|E
25|$|The {{comic book}} ridicules aspects of American society, {{including}} capitalism and racism. There were also direct references to local Italian reality, whose social ills were often satirized by Magnus & Bunker, {{as well as}} terms in <b>Milanese</b> dialect.|$|E
25|$|Inter {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{supported}} clubs in Italy, according to an August 2007 research by Italian newspaper La Repubblica. Historically, the largest section of Inter fans from the city of Milan were the middle-class bourgeoisie <b>Milanese,</b> while Milan fans were typically working-class.|$|E
25|$|The tumultuous {{period of}} early 20th century brought several, radical {{innovations}} in <b>Milanese</b> architecture. Art Nouveau, {{also known as}} Liberty in Italy, is recognisable in Palazzo Castiglioni, built by architect Giuseppe Sommaruga between 1901 and 1904. Other remarkable examples include Hotel Corso and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional <b>Milanese</b> Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, {{regarded as one of}} the last such types of architecture in the city. A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past. An important example of Art Deco, which blended such styles with Fascist architecture, is the huge Central railway station inaugurated in 1931.|$|E
25|$|In 1425 he was savio del consiglio, {{until he}} was elected as Procurator of St Mark's on 17 June. At this time, Venice decided to join the war between the ruler of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, and the Republic of Florence, as Visconti's successes were {{threatening}} {{the balance of power}} in Italy. In 1426, Loredan was appointed as provveditore of the army along with Fantino Michiel, and accompanied the condottiere Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola in the conquest of Brescia (9–10 August 1426). Loredan remained in the city as rector over the next year. In summer 1427 he repelled a <b>Milanese</b> attack on Brescia, and was one of the driving forces in getting Carmagnola to abandon his dilatory stance and confront the <b>Milanese,</b> leading to the victory of the Battle of Maclodio on 11 October.|$|E
25|$|Lines {{run in the}} Milan {{municipality}} for the 80% of {{the total}} length (93 stations).

The network covers about 20% of Milan's total area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milanese</b> {{authorities}} {{decided to}} temporarily suspend charging the Ecopass fees during a three-week period in August 2008 {{in order to}} facilitate tourism inside the restricted area (ZTL), considering that during this time of the summer local traffic drops by around 30% and pollution levels are usually at a minimum level.|$|E
25|$|The {{fashion in}} all cathedral rites of the Mediterranean {{was a new}} {{emphasis}} on the psalter. In older ceremonies before Christianity became the religion of empires, the recitation of the biblical odes (mainly taken from the Old Testament) was much more important. They did not disappear in certain cathedral rites such as the <b>Milanese</b> and the Constantinopolitan rite.|$|E
25|$|Threads are {{a popular}} {{condiment}} for rice in Spain and Iran, India and Pakistan, and other countries. Two {{examples of such}} saffron rice is the zarzuela fish-seafood stew and paella valenciana, a piquant rice-meat preparation. It is essential in making the French bouillabaisse, which is a spicy fish stew from Marseilles, and the Italian risotto alla <b>milanese.</b>|$|E
25|$|His {{father was}} an {{aeronautical}} official and worked at Forlanini airport (now more commonly known as Linate). During the Second World War he {{took part in the}} Italian resistance movement, in particular during the defense of <b>Milanese</b> aviation at Piazza Novelli, an act which later inspired songs such as Sei minuti all'alba ("Six Minutes to Dawn").|$|E
25|$|Parsley is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} in Italian salsa verde, which is a mixed condiment of parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic, and sometimes bread, soaked in vinegar. It is an Italian custom to serve it with bollito misto or fish. Gremolata, a mixture of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest, is a traditional accompaniment to the Italian veal stew, ossobuco alla <b>milanese.</b>|$|E
25|$|After its <b>Milanese</b> debut, {{the opera}} {{received}} very successful performances in Vienna in February 1828 {{and also in}} Naples three months later. Both productions starred Rubini, Tamburini, and—in the role of Imogene—Rubini's wife, Adelaide Comelli-Rubini, about whom Bellini had initial misgivings, although it appears that she acquitted herself very well. By this time, Bellini had begun to achieve international fame.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{surviving}} {{source for}} the meeting from Napoleon III. The only direct report of the discussions comes from Cavour.

This letter was made public in 1883 in La Perseveranza, a <b>Milanese</b> newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{important}} research of Giovanni Reale, an Italian historian of philosophy who extended the Tübingen paradigm in new directions, {{it is today}} also called the 'Tübingen and <b>Milanese</b> School.'
