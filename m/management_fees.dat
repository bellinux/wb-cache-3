25|$|<b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> are {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's net asset value and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard. They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. <b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the performance fee provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund {{management}} {{firms are}} usually owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits {{that the business}} makes. As <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess <b>management</b> <b>fees)</b> are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on {{factors such as the}} fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them. Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{management}}</b> <b>fee</b> is paid by {{the fund}} to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund, provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund. The fund manager may also provide other administrative services. The <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole) increase. The fund's board reviews the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive {{some or all of}} the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> in order to lower the fund's expense ratio.|$|R

25|$|Typically a small {{commission}} is charged for trading in gold ETPs {{and a small}} annual storage fee is charged. The annual expenses of the fund such as storage, insurance, and <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> are charged by selling {{a small amount of}} gold represented by each certificate, so the amount of gold in each certificate will gradually decline over time.|$|E
25|$|Some {{hedge funds}} charge a {{redemption}} fee (or withdrawal fee) for early withdrawals during a specified {{period of time}} (typically a year) or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment. The purpose of the fee is to discourage short-term investing, reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance. Unlike <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> and performance fees, redemption fees are usually kept by the fund.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 2009, Judge Burton Lifland {{approved}} the settlement between Picard and Banco Santander SA's Optimal Investment Services. The Optimal SUS fund, one of Madoff's largest feeder funds, {{agreed to pay}} $235 million, about 85% of the $285 million that the Geneva-based hedge fund group redeemed in the 90 days before Madoff was arrested. As of December 2008, Santander had $3.2 billion of clients' money invested with Madoff, a relationship that started in 1996. The fund continues to have claims against Madoff's estate. The largest Spanish bank earned nearly $100 million in <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> in 2006 and 2007 combined selling the feeder fund. Santander lost €17 million ($23.8 million) of its own money. 70% of its affected clients are in Latin America. In April, Santander offered its clients compensation for losses from the fraud, and 93% of clients affected by the Madoff fraud had accepted, which it originally valued at €1.38 billion. The offer has been widely criticized.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is because}} funds have both fixed and {{variable}} expenses, but most expenses are variable. Variable costs are fixed on a percentage basis.

500|$|The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) {{was also}} {{reported}} to have identified issues with inadequate disclosure of information to potential investors, poor performance of the investments, and high <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> for agricultural MIS schemes. In 2003, the commission commented that it [...] "has deployed a disproportionate percentage of its resources to the regulation of this sector, which represents {{only a minority of}} funds under management".

500|$|Returns {{to investors}} {{comprised}} {{a tax deduction}} in {{the year in which}} they bought the products, and returns from the sale of produce {{over the life of the}} project, which was typically at the point of harvest 10–12 years later for plantations, [...] "and up to 23 years for horticultural projects such as almonds". Great Southern would deduct <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> from the final sale value. A typical forestry investment in the early 2000s involved an initial payment of $3000 for one-third of a hectare woodlot, yielding a $2900 tax deduction at that time. Returns on harvesting depended on many variables; Great Southern forecast that investors would recoup their original investment and a further return of between $1923 and $4569 per woodlot, however early schemes did not achieve these figures on the basis of the timber sales, with some resulting in woodchip sales of only around A$1500, half the value of what was originally invested. Investors received their returns when the product (usually woodchip) was harvested and sold.|$|E

500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and <b>management</b> <b>fees,</b> even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering). Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: [...] "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary {{to save the life of}} the patient.
