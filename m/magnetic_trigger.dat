50|$|On {{the night}} of 20/21 September 1940, four {{parachute}} mines fell on Dagenham but only one exploded. Moore, working alongside Chief Petty Officer George Wheeler, examined one of the unexploded bombs with a very damaged fuse ring {{which could not be}} removed. Moore used a borrowed drill to drill either side of the fuse so it broke in half and could be extracted. He was removing the mine's <b>magnetic</b> <b>trigger</b> when Ryan arrived after disarming another mine.|$|E
50|$|A {{land mine}} can be {{triggered}} {{by a number of}} things including pressure, movement, sound, magnetism and vibration. Anti-personnel mines commonly use the pressure of a person's foot as a trigger, but tripwires are also frequently employed. Most modern anti-vehicle mines use a <b>magnetic</b> <b>trigger</b> to enable it to detonate even if the tires or tracks did not touch it. Advanced mines are able to sense the difference between friendly and enemy types of vehicles by way of a built-in signature catalog. This will theoretically enable friendly forces to use the mined area while denying the enemy access.|$|E

Fuel metering is {{by a single}} constant-velocity style sidedraft carburetor, typically a Keihin CVK clone or similar. Ignition is by CDI, with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>trigger</b> on the flywheel. Because the trigger is on the flywheel instead of the cam, the ignition will fire on both the compression and exhaust strokes, known as [...] "wasted spark" [...] ignition". An integrated magneto provides 50 V AC power for the CDI system and 20-30 V AC rectified and regulated to 12 V DC for chassis accessories (such as lighting), and to charge a battery.|$|E

50|$|The E-Mag is an {{electronic}} Automag. Like other Automags, {{it has gone}} through different versions corresponding to advances to the Automag platform like the ReTro Valve, the Level 10 anti-chop system and the X-valve. Unlike most electronic markers, the E-mag is capable of firing in both electronic and mechanical modes through means of a readily available selector switch. The battery is rated for approximately 10 cases of paint (20,000 shots), This is {{in stark contrast to}} other electronic markers of the time(2000-2004) that must be recharged frequently or risk going {{down in the middle of}} a game, the trade off is that the E-Mag uses a much larger battery pack, whereas most markers operated off of a normal 9v battery. The E-Mag uses an unusual Hall effect sensor trigger instead of the more common microswitch, and the sensitivity of this <b>magnetic</b> <b>trigger</b> system gives the E-Mag a reputation for having hair trigger. Indeed, there have been many instances where the marker has fired from a slight jar instead of an intentional trigger pull. As a result, the safety is a very reliable actuator interrupt, and the marker is physically incapable of firing with it engaged.|$|E
40|$|Sympathetic eruptions on the Sun {{have been}} {{observed}} for several decades, but the mechanisms by which one eruption can trigger another one remain poorly understood. We present a 3 D MHD simulation that suggests two possible <b>magnetic</b> <b>trigger</b> mechanisms for sympathetic eruptions. We consider a configuration that contains two coronal flux ropes located within a pseudo-streamer and one rope located next to it. A sequence of eruptions is initiated by triggering the eruption of the flux rope next to the streamer. The expansion of the rope leads to two consecutive reconnection events, each of which triggers the eruption of a flux rope by removing a sufficient amount of overlying flux. The simulation qualitatively reproduces {{important aspects of the}} global sympathetic event on 2010 August 1 and provides a scenario for so-called twin filament eruptions. The suggested mechanisms are applicable also for sympathetic eruptions occurring in other magnetic configurations. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted in ApJ Letter...|$|E

Thermal cyclotron lines have been detected in coronal loops, suggesting the presence of hot current sheets that enhance emission from relatively thin layers of enhanced temperature and constant magnetic field.

A filament-associated source with a high brightness temperature and steep radiation spectrum occurs above a region of apparently weak photospheric field. This source might be attributed to currents that enhance coronal magnetic fields.

40|$|AbstractMore {{and more}} data {{accumulate}} concerning calcium dependent effects in all compartments of cells. The higher the organism in evolution the more calcium becomes involved. Inspection {{of the data}} while looking for {{an explanation of the}} involvement of calcium in metabolism, nuclear functions, control over pumps, external activities, mineralisation and so on leads one to suppose that calcium has an integrating function. The implication is that calcium flow is a large network connecting the environment, the cytoplasm, vesicles, organelles, the nucleus and in higher species, organs. There is the possibility then that calcium ion functions are being analysed, often in vitro, in a bit by bit reductionist manner while in vivo calcium is the equivalent of an electron in complicated electrical circuits. We then should look for its connections to energy, to effects where conformational switching by calcium pulses is equivalent to <b>magnetic</b> <b>triggering</b> by electron flow and where storage in vesicles is equivalent to condenser-like devices and so on. The appearance of pulsing, of time delays in parts of circuits, and other properties of electronic circuits seen in calcium triggering are then explicable as part of calcium circuit design. No other ion can operate in the same way due to the peculiarities of the calcium ion, its size, charge, ionisation potential and its availability which allow it both to flow rapidly yet to bind considerably...|$|R
40|$|In shape-memory polymers, {{changes in}} shape are mostly induced by heating, and {{exceeding}} a specific switching temperature, Tswitch. If polymers cannot be warmed up by heat transfer using a hot liquid or gaseous medium, noncontact triggering will be required. In this article, the magnetically induced shape-memory effect of composites from magnetic nanoparticles and thermoplastic shape-memory polymers is introduced. A polyetherurethane (TFX) and a biodegradable multiblock copolymer (PDC) with poly(p-dioxanone) as hard segment and poly(ε-caprolactone) as soft segment were investigated as matrix component. Nanoparticles consisting of an iron(III) oxide core in a silica matrix could be processed into both polymers. A homogeneous particle distribution in TFX could be shown. Compounds have suitable elastic and thermal properties for the shape-memory functionalization. Temporary shapes of TFX compounds {{were obtained by}} elongating at increased temperature and subsequent cooling under constant stress. Cold-drawing of PDC compounds at 25 °C resulted in temporary fixation of the mechanical deformation by 50 – 60 %. The shape-memory effect of both composite systems could be induced by inductive heating in an alternating magnetic field (f = 258 kHz; H = 30 kA·m− 1). The maximum temperatures achievable by inductive heating in a specific magnetic field depend on sample geometry and nanoparticle content. Shape recovery rates of composites resulting from <b>magnetic</b> <b>triggering</b> are comparable to those obtained by increasing the environmental temperature...|$|R

40|$|Relativistic Sweet-Parker type {{magnetic}} reconnection is {{investigated by}} relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) simulations. As an initial setting, we assume anti-parallel magnetic fields and a spatially uniform resistivity. A perturbation {{imposed on the}} <b>magnetic</b> fields <b>triggers</b> <b>magnetic</b> reconnection around a current sheet, and the plasma inflows into the reconnection region. The inflows are then heated due to ohmic dissipation in the diffusion region, and finally become relativistically hot outflows. The outflows are not accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (i. e., Lorentz factor ~ 1), even when the magnetic energy dominates the thermal and rest mass energies in the inflow region. Most of the magnetic energy in the inflow region is converted into the thermal energy of the outflow during the reconnection process. The energy conversion from magnetic to thermal energy in the diffusion region results {{in an increase in}} the plasma inertia. This prevents the outflows from being accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds. We find that the reconnection rate R obeys the scaling relation R S^{- 0. 5 }, where S is the Lundquist number. This feature is {{the same as that of}} non-relativistic reconnection. Our results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of Lyubarsky (2005) for Sweet-Parker type magnetic reconnection.
