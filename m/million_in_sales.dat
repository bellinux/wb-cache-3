5|$|The 1998 sequel, Blues Brothers 2000, {{had similar}} traits to the original, {{including}} large car-chase scenes and musical numbers.

King, and Eric Clapton, among others. Dozens of artists were packed into an all-star band called The Louisiana Gator Boys. Even with many returning cast members, the film was considered a box-office failure, only generating a little over $14 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales,</b> and critics' reactions were very poor.|$|E

5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales.</b> Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an inability to pay off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{portion of}} SR 125 {{would be built}} in stages, {{at the same time}} as the portion south of SR 94. The reconstruction of the interchange with I-8 was completed in April 1993. The construction process began in April 1996, at a cost of $177 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> tax revenue. The first phase of the construction of the eastern portion of the SR 54 freeway corresponded with the construction of SR 125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR 94; construction began in 1996 at a cost of $313.5 million, using money from sales tax revenue. The plans were to exclude the controversial ramps at Troy and Palm streets. After weather-related construction delays due to the El Niño season of the winter of 1997–1998, as well as a contractor declaring bankruptcy, the extension of SR52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR125 was dedicated on May9, 1998, as well as SR 125 from Mission Gorge Road to Grossmont College Drive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>sales.</b> In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
