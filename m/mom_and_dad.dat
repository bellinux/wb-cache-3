500|$|The {{film was}} at the center of many {{high-profile}} lawsuits and condemnations.

It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and <b>Mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dad</b> during the film's run. [...] Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks. [...] One successful challenge was in New York City, where <b>Mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dad</b> remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as [...] "indecent".|$|E
