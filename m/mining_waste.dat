One of gangue minerals {{which are in}} the form of sand during diamond mine in Cempaka Banjarbaru is Zircon sand.   Until now, that zircon sand has not been utilized optimally. Based on the size measurement of sand grains from diamond <b>mine</b> <b>waste,</b> it is passed the standard of filter size number 4 and related with 4. 75 mm filter hole. However the result includes 2. 69 Apparent Specific Gravity as well as 1. 41 g/cm 3 density. That result is categorized into normal aggregate type and lower compared to other sand location (Matraman area). By looking at the morphology and size of sand grains from diamond <b>mine</b> <b>waste,</b> it is gained smaller and tighter particles distribution, equal particle distribution and varied particle size. When looking at the form of sand grains, that diamond <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> sand is categorized under Sub Angular Grain. Based on EDX spectrum analysis result, it is contained C, O, Al, Si, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zr. Based on 3 different samples of diamond <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> sand, it is gained average Zr value which is the first Zr sample 1. 5, the second Zr sample 0. 485, the third Zr sample 0. 925.

40|$|The slope {{stability}} of <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> dumps {{is controlled by}} the shear strength of <b>mining</b> <b>wastes</b> which are mostly rockfill materials. Triaxial tests and direct shear tests were conducted to investigate the shear strength of a phyllite rockfill material from a <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> dump. The behavior of the rockfill material is investigated from low to high confining pressures. The effect of soaking in acid tailings water on the shear strength of the rockfill material is studied. Particle breakage of the rockfill material increases with confining pressure. The increasing rate decreases as the confining pressure increases. An empirical equation is proposed to describe the breakage of the rockfill material. The strength of the rockfill material soaked in acid tailings water decreases with the soaking time. A new empirical strength criterion is proposed that can describe the strength change with confining pressure and particle breakage. Using the proposed strength criterion, the {{slope stability}} of the Xiyuan waste dump, the toe of which is soaked in the tailings pond, is analyzed using the Bishop method. The results show that both particle breakage and acid water damage decrease the slope stability of the <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> dump.
