5|$|Apples {{are often}} eaten raw. The whole fruit {{including}} {{the skin is}} {{suitable for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> some consumers. The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

5|$|Estrogen levels <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> thyroid behavior. For example, {{during the}} luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} levels are lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen levels are higher).|$|E

5|$|Opportunistic infections may {{be caused}} by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are {{normally}} controlled by the immune system. Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person's environment. These infections <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> nearly every organ system.|$|E

5|$|Basic {{research}} on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate {{the production of}} detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against colon cancer. Cabbage {{is a source of}} indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> {{the quality of life}} more deeply.|$|E
5|$|Feather mites of {{at least}} two species have been found on the storm petrel, with Halipeurus pelagicus {{occurring}} at much higher densities than Philoceanus robertsi. The flea Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> their survival rate.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> the cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|Other eye {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related {{conditions which}} <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> a Parson are deafness and patella luxation. The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Too little {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. It has been reported as “moderately common”, although difficult to find because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings. Its distribution across the British Virgin Islands seems to be limited, and development <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> it further.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract infections <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> 10% {{of people}} during childhood. Among {{children}} urinary tract infections {{are the most}} common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year. Estimates of frequency among children however vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and two years, two to 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.|$|E

The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost no}} land left to develop for housing, Teaneck's {{population}} {{is likely to}} remain stable for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth. Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> population over time.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
