40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that supernovae in other galaxies create {{spontaneous}} opportunities to probe spectroscopically the gaseous material in galactic halos. Because of their brightness, supernovae offer an unparalleled chance to obtain spectra with high wavelength resolution and/or signal-to-noise ratio. The present investigation is concerned with observations of visual interstellar lines in the spectrum of a supernova discovered on July 3, 1983, and identified as Type I. The supernova was located 124 arc sec south and 122 arc sec west of the nucleus of M 83. Evidence is obtained that for velocities near that of M 83, the line of sight toward the supernova contains a complex array of absorption features of Ca II.

Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and a barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg).

40|$|Learning {{the basics}} of the logic of certain and the {{uncertain}} is presented {{as the result of}} a work of an interdisciplinary team. Our experimentation involves essentially two aspects: language comprehension of a statement and analysis of the information. The first aspect is to see how children interpret a sentence with subject and predicate, that is, if they believe that the truth values that can be assigned are those of bivalent logic, i. e. true or false, or truth-values of a multivalent logic i. e. if there is the possibility/need to consider truth values intermediate between true and false such as: <b>more</b> true <b>than</b> false, <b>more</b> false <b>than</b> true, <b>halfway</b> between true and false. It is also required children to identify phrases not complete and therefore that are not linguistic statements. Regarding the second aspect it comes to analyzing the information on the concept expressed by a proposition, i. e. to see if it is possible to immediately assign to it a truth value, or if it is necessary to acquire a further information. Moreover we highlight the distinction between uncertainty due to incomplete information, which leads to probability assessments, and semantic uncertainty that leads to the theory of fuzzy sets...|$|R

5|$|The large incisor is {{inclined}} forward, and its rootthe {{only part of}} the tooth that is preservedforms an angle of about 55° with the horizontal. At the tip of the alveolus, where the tooth projects out of the bone, it is 3.0mm (0.12 in) high and 2.1mm broad. The root extends through the dentary to a position below the third cheektooth. Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second. The third tooth, the largest of the cheekteeth, has the root slightly curved backward. This root is deeply anchored in the dentary, extending down through about three-fourths of the bone. The crown is preserved {{in the form of a}} stump of dentine, 2.3mm (0.091 in) long and 1.9mm (0.075 in) broad, that extends high above the dentary, indicating that the tooth was hypsodont (high-crowned). High dentine stumps also remain of the fourth and fifth cheekteeth. The fourth is about as large as the first and second and the fifth is smaller, with a diameter of about 1.0mm (0.039 in).

5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>halfway</b> to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E

These spike-like fins were probably used to lift the body clear off the bottom; its heavy armor {{would have made it}} sink quickly as soon as it lost forward momentum.

In addition to the pectoral fins, it also had two dorsal fins: a low, elongated anterior dorsal fin and a high rounded posterior dorsal fin —though the hypothesized structure of the dorsal fins varies based on the specific species of Bothriolepis and has been modified several times in the reconstructions released by researchers as new information has become available. The caudal tail was elongated, ending in a narrow band, but is unfortunately rarely preserved in fossils. Although there is no agreed upon explanation of their function, Bothriolepis also had two membranous, ventral frills located on the posterior end of the trunk carapace {{on either side of the}} tail that each have two distinct regions. There is no evidence that the frills were involved in support of the skeleton but it is possible that they either functioned as fins or were involved in reproduction, and may have even been present in one sex but not the other.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Although uncommon, {{selective}} cervical {{nerve root}} blocks can have serious complications. The most serious complications {{that have been}} reported include cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, transient quadriplegia and death. Case presentation A 40 -year-old Japanese woman {{with a history of}} severe right-sided cervical radicular pain was scheduled to undergo a right-sided C 6 selective cervical nerve root block using a transforaminal approach under fluoroscopic guidance. An anterior oblique view of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen was obtained, and a 23 -gauge spinal needle, connected to the normal extension tube with a syringe filled with contrast medium, was introduced into the posterior-caudal aspect of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen on the right side. In the anteroposterior view, the placement of the needle was considered satisfactory when it was placed no <b>more</b> medial <b>than</b> <b>halfway</b> across the width of the articular pillar. Although the spread of the contrast medium along the C 6 nerve root was observed with right-sided C 6 radiculography, the subdural flow of the contrast medium was not observed with real-time fluoroscopy. The extension tube used for the radiculography was removed from the spinal needle and a normal extension tube with a syringe filled with lidocaine connected in its place. We performed a negative aspiration test and then injected 1. 5 [*]mL of 1. 0 % lidocaine slowly around the C 6 nerve root. Immediately after the injection of the local anesthetic, our patient developed acute flaccid paralysis, complained of breathing difficulties and became unresponsive; her respiratory pattern was uncoordinated. After 20 minutes, she regained consciousness and became alert, and her muscle strength in all four limbs returned to normal without any sensory deficits after receiving emergent cardiorespiratory support. Conclusions We believe that confirming maintenance of the appropriate needle position in the anteroposterior view by injecting local anesthetic is important for preventing central needle movement. Because the potential risk of serious complications cannot be completely eliminated during the use of any established selective cervical nerve root block procedure, preparation for an emergency airway, ventilation and cardiovascular support is indispensable in cases of high spinal cord anesthesia. </p...|$|R
