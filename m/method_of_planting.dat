25|$|The {{traditional}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>planting</b> {{coffee is}} to place 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.|$|E

Borders can go {{right up to the}} house, lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants.

2500|$|The Athenian Mercury set {{the stage}} for the later Spectator, Gray's Inn Journal, Temple Bar Journal, and scores of {{politically}} oriented journals, such as the original The Guardian, The Observer, The Freeholder, Mist's Journal, and many others.

The plant used for the study was Cynodon dactylon (Linn.) Pers. The new method includes the steps of size reduction <b>of</b> the <b>plant</b> material, taking the plant material and solvent in culture tubes, closing the tubes properly and dipping these tubes into liquid nitrogen at below - 196 °C, melting the frozen material inside the tubes and collecting the liquid extract. The new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> extraction avoids exposing liquid nitrogen in open environment and thus avoids the drawbacks <b>of</b> the available <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> extraction using liquid nitrogen in open environment. </p...|$|R

The intensity of the beam in ion source is an important parameter for the sensitivity of AMS measurement. The high beam current can improve the sensitivity of AMS. The preparation <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> samples <b>of</b> 41 Ca tracer were systematically studied to obtain high beam current using wet, dry and a combining method with wet and dry re-fluoride.
