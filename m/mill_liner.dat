40|$|Wear of {{grinding}} mill liners and lifters {{plays a major}} role in the overall efficiency and economics of mineral processing. Change in the shape of lifters as they wear has a significant influence on grinding efficiency, and the annual cost of maintenance and mill down-time depends on the life of both liners and lifters. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a computational method for simulating the dynamics of particle processes. This paper presents an analysis of 3 D simulation of a {{grinding mill}} carried out using the EDEM software package customised to predict the rate of wear of lifter geometry and to enable progressive updating of worn lifter geometry profiles. A simplified breakage rate model is developed as a tool to correlate liner profile to mill performance. The combination of the prediction of liner profile and grinding rate shows promise to provide a powerful tool for advanced <b>mill</b> <b>liner</b> design - providing a means to balance liner life and mill performance over the life of the liner at the liner design stage...|$|E
40|$|Tumbling mills, which consume around 6 % of world's {{electric}} power, though inefficient (use 1 % of the supplied energy) {{have been}} used in mineral processing industry for over a century. Harsh internal mill environments have prevented the access to in-mill dynamics. This situation has led researchers to develop models based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to predict internal mill dynamics. But before DEM models can be used in the mineral processing industry, their rigorous validation is essential. In this thesis, we have carried out real time analysis of the DEM model to enable online availability of the mill parameters for the mill operators. We have completed rigorous validation of a DEM model based on nine mill parameters by comparing the predicted parameters under varying operating conditions of a 30 " pilot mill and some simulated industrial mills. Further, we have also developed a simulator to predict the wear on the tumbling <b>mill</b> <b>liner</b> profile. Results show that the charge motion simulator used is faster than real time. The validation exercise showed that improvements to charge motion are possible, liner wear prediction is feasible but affects real-time simulator behaviour. Based on these results, it is recommended to continue the improvement of the charge motion model as well as the liner wear model...|$|E
40|$|Tumbling mills {{describe}} {{a class of}} mechanical systems defined by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rocks that rotate around their own longitudinal axis. Due to the action of charges, the lifters/liners wear significantly and their shape will be changed which will influence {{the efficiency of the}} <b>mill.</b> <b>Liner</b> bolts are the mill components which connect the mill interior with the exterior environment. With this property, bolts have been paid more and more attention. The first part of the thesis covers the structural analysis of the lifter/liner bolts, and the possibility for on-line charge motion measurement with the aid of bolts is discussed by comparing the strain distributions at the bolt areas where the bolts occupy different mill circumferential positions. In order to measure the lifter/liner wear, a real-time, on-line wear sensor was developed by the Comminution Dynamics Laboratory. However, the positioning of the sensor/sensors affects the strength of the mill is unknown. The second part of the project provides detailed research on this issue by FEA analysis so as to provide a basis for the practical application of this kind of sensors. Finally, during the grinding process of tumbling mills, some mills can vibrate greatly at some ranges of mill rotating speeds and as a result the mills cannot work properly because of this vibration or resonance. With six different mill models, the final part of the thesis investigates the mill natural frequencies and their modes by FEA and furthermore, explores the effect of mill diameter, length on these frequencies and modes...|$|E

Although this has been particularly evident in the size of haulage trucks and shovels used in the mining operation, this phenomena has also filtered into the area of minerals processing and into milling in particular. SAG and ball mills have grown in size and there are now many operational mills in the range of 28 – 40 feet in diameter with installed powers ranging between 8 – 20 MW. The very high capacity of these mills and the common use of variable speed drives often result in operational problems.

40|$|<b>Mill</b> <b>liner</b> is an {{important}} part of mill. It has to withstand strikes and wear. Nowadays mill liners can be made of many different materials. In this work the focus is mainly on rubber liners. The aim of this thesis is to get better understanding how the properties of rubber affect to wear resistance of rubber material. Coumpounds including natural rubber and/or styrene butadiene rubber are widely used in mill liners. Their properties are good enough in applications where wear resistance is needed and they are also cost-effective. Moreover processing of these rubbers is not difficult. Many kinds of wear types occur with rubber materials during their use. The greatest of them is abrasive wear. Moreover impact wear, erosion wear and fatigue wear cause wearing of mill liners. Naturally each wear type has its own characteristics and different mechanisms. Sometimes testing of material wear is difficult and takes a lot of time. Different wear simulation methods can be used to reduce this work. One of them is 'Discrete Element Method' i. e. DEM. In this method Newton's laws of motion are used to describe motions of particles and their contact with next to each other particles. DEM also offers a possibility to simulate behaviour of mills in different situations. Thus, the method can be applied to evaluating wear of mill liners too. Material wear properties can be tested by different methods. Some of the can be mentioned. One of them is rotary tribometer which produces sliding to the surface of sample. The other is Goodrich-fleksometer which makes possible to compare hysteretic behaviour of vulcanized rubber compounds. Test methods which mimic abrasive, impact and erosion wear were selected to the experimental part. Mass reduction of samples was measured during testing. From these tests more information was gained of wear resistance of rubber materials which are used in mill liners when they are exposed to different wear models and selection of materials which can be applied to mill liners...|$|E
40|$|Platinum group {{elements}} (PGE) are {{mineral resources}} {{that serve as}} strategic economic drivers for the Republic of South Africa. Most of the known to date remaining reserves of PGM’s in South Africa {{are found in the}} UG 2 chromite layer of the Bushveld Igneous Complex. Platinum concentrators experience significant losses of valuable PGE in their secondary milling circuits due to insufficient liberation of platinum-bearing particles. The interlocked texture between chromite and the valuable minerals predisposes the PGM ores to an inefficient froth flotation and thereby leads to drastic problems at the smelters. Entrainment of fine chromite is a major problem, so the reduction of fine chromite content in the UG 2 ore prior to flotation is therefore crucial. The Council for Mineral Technology (Mintek) has been aiming at improving the secondary ball milling of the Platinum Group Ores by optimisation of the ball milling parameters {{from the perspective of a}} preferential grinding of the non-chromite component in the UG 2 ore. To this end, we looked at determining which one amongst speed, liner profile and ball size better controls the energy consumed. Moreover, this work sought at determining which combination of the above variables maximises the reduction of the chromite sliming of UG 2 ores. Prior to the experimental work, preliminary evaluations of the load behaviour and power draw under different milling conditions were performed by use of the Discrete Element Modelling (DEM). The DEM was also used to assess the distributions of tumbling mill’s impact energy dissipated between balls and between balls and mill shell. The ability of the Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) to match selected experimental scenarios was appraised as well. The actual ball milling test results indicated that variables, such as <b>mill</b> <b>liner</b> profile and ball size affect the milling efficiency and the size distribution of the products whereas, the mill rotational speed had little to no effect. Use of 45 ° lifters and small balls enhanced the grinding efficiency. These results agreed fairly well with the DEM simulation predictions. A model describing the chromite content within the UG 2 ore sample as a function of density and particle size was also developed. The model was found to be reliable in the range of data tested and proved to be a strong function of the ore sample density. The particle size was less relevant but nevertheless important. The UG 2 ore was then assumed to be constituted of a binary mixture: chromite and nonchromite components. The kinetics study was then conducted for each individual component, from the feed sizes: - 600 + 425, - 425 + 300, - 300 + 212, - 212 + 150 μm. With regard to the Selection Function (Si), when comparing the characteristic a values (slope of Si with respect to particle size), faster breakage was obtained for the chromite component, followed by UG 2 ore and the non chromite component. The cumulative breakage distribution function (Bi,j) values obtained for these two components were different in terms of the fineness factor γ. The value of γ was smaller for the chromite component, indicating that the higher relative amounts of progeny fines were produced from the breakage, while the value of γ was large for the non-chromite component, indicating that less relative amounts of fines were produced. Finally, a matrix model transformation of a binary UG 2 ore was developed for a basic closed ball mill-hydrocyclone circuit. The model described satisfactorily the grinding behaviour of the chromite and non-chromite separately. This model is useful for showing effects of the milling of a binary ore on the ball mill circuit output...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball <b>mill</b> <b>liner</b> replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|E

Although the lifters are durable wear parts but they will gradually worn and consequently their dimensions change {{during the course of}} operation.

Therefore, it is useful to know the relationship between the mill operation and the lifter profile, and the influence of lifter wear on the change in lifter profile. In this work, a laboratory mill which is capable of producing the required impact and abrasion grinding was operated both wet and dry. Many factors were varied such as: velocity, charge, ore size and different material for the lifters. Also the wear rate on the top and face of lifters are compared in the different conditions. It is found that the mill charge and the mill speed significantly affect the wear rate. Also, the results showed how size distribution affects the wear rate. The results can be interpreted in terms of the wear process in industrial scale mills over different operating conditions.

40|$|White {{cast irons}} perform much less favourably in {{industrial}} service environments such as ball mills {{than would be}} predicted by standard laboratory abrasion tests. Pin abrasive tests are widely thought to simulate high stress abrasion, but in reality they grossly over-estimate service lives of white iron <b>mill</b> <b>liners</b> compared to pearlitic steel liners. The 2 ̆ 7 impact-abrasion 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis {{has suggested that the}} key difference between laboratory and service conditions is impact. However, we have found no evidence of such a phenomenon in ball mills, and instead the observed behaviour is attributed to high stress abrasion in the service environment. The defining characteristics of high stress abrasion are re-stated in a way that emphasises the load able to be transmitted to the wearing surface through the abrasive particle. Data are presented which indicate that abrasive wear mode can be identified from quantitative performance comparisons between key classes of wear-resistant alloys. Three useful diagnostics are proposed. Using these diagnostics it is shown that pin abrasive tests do not represent high stress abrasion in any industrially-relevant sense. Appropriately modest performance of white irons can be reproduced in various laboratory apparatus having zero or negligible impact energy: RWAT-analogues using solid metal wheels (xWAT), the Abex block-on-track apparatus, and a simple laboratory ball mill abrasion test (BMAT). Of these, the BMAT most closely reproduces the contact and particle mechanics of service conditions, and can give quantitative alloy performance comparisons closely matching those in service. This paper discusses some features of the BMAT and presents preliminary data for white cast irons. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the first stage of}} a project to {{investigate}} the parameters effecting the performance of tube mills. The main topics that the project will cover are the motion of mill charge and the wear characteristics of the balls and the <b>mill</b> <b>liners.</b> A literature survey highlighted that no examination had been performed that investigated the motion of a particle with specific emphasis on the response to changes in the coefficient of friction between the particle and the liner. This thesis concentrates on the motion of a single particle moving on the inside of a smooth rotating cylinder. Three formulations are presented that model the motion of the particle. The first model assumes that the particle slides along the cylinder. To ensure that it slides, and does not roll, a block shaped particle is modelled. The second motion type assumes that a spherical shaped particle rolls along the cylinder. The assumption that is made, is that the point of contact between the ball and the cylinder does not slip or skid. This mode of rolling has been defined as Pure Rolling. A third model is proposed that is a combination of the sliding and rolling models. The formulation attempts to incorporate both actions, rolling and sliding. In this way the motion of the particle. is dependent on both the rolling and sliding interactions. The governing equations for the Sliding and Rolling models are solved numerically, using an Euler Forward Approximation. Both models are solved by a computer implementation of the resulting numerical equations. The Sliding program has been extended to animate the response of the block {{on the inside of the}} cylinder.

Various types of data {{can be used as}} the input of ANN, such as some process variables, monitoring data (vibration signals), evaluation characteristics (age and stop time), and some historical features. The output of ANN is RUL prediction or performance degradation assessment, which is used for conducting effective maintenance strategies. ANNs widely used in fault prediction include BPNN [91 – 95], radial basis function network (RBFN), and RNN [96]. Ahmadzadeh, et al [94], proposed a three-layer feedforward BPNN for RUL estimation of grinding <b>mill</b> <b>liners,</b> which considered degeneration and condition monitoring data as the inputs of ANN, and used RUL as the output of ANN. Rodriguez, et al [95], presented ANN (six input layers, three hidden layers, and one output layer) to predict and simulate the behavior of life-cycle assessment in blades of steam turbines. In view of the shortcomings of traditional incremental training methods in long-term prediction, Malhi, et al [96], proposed an RNN based on competitive learning method to improve the accuracy in long-term prediction of rolling bearings. Mahamad, et al [97], used feedforward neural network and the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm to predict the RUL of rolling bearings. Considering the complexity and nonlinearity of the pitch system, and the difficulty of describing with precise mathematical model, Chen, et al [98], proposed ANFIS based on a prior knowledge, which was used to predict wind turbine pitch faults. Existing ANN methods predict the RUL by using failure history data, but suspended historical data are rarely utilized. Hong, et al [99], used a self-organizing map, which combined wavelet packet and EMD for feature extraction, to estimate bearing performance degradation. Javed, et al [100], used ELM and fuzzy clustering to predict the degradation state and the RUL of complex nonlinear systems.

40|$|M. Tech (Metallurgy) Abrasive wear is a {{major factor}} in the {{production}} costs of the mining industry in South Africa (as is the case in the rest of the world). These costs arise from the need to replace consumables such as digger teeth, <b>mill</b> <b>liners,</b> screens and chutes. Some materials used in these areas have been used for years with little or no change to their properties such as Hadfields manganese steel; others have been significantly modified to improve their performance, as is the case with high chromium white cast iron. Some areas in the mining industry have made a complete chanlfe of material in order to reduce wear rates; the use of 9 % Cr stainless steel () is an example of this. In some applications metals have been successfully replaced by ceramics for example the use of alumina in combination with cemented tungsten carbides ash conditioner blades (2) at ESKOM power stations. Significant improvements in profitability (in the form of reduced consumable costs and increased productivity) can be realised by the development of new abrasion resistant materials; hence many organisations are constantly involved in such work. The fundamental property required to resist abrasive wear is hardness, however a degree of toughness is always required depending on the application. Composite materials have the best possibility of combining these properties, for example high chrome white iron can be regarded as a composite material on a microscopic scale with very hard carbides supported by a tough martensitic matrix. This material performs extremely well in many highly erosive environments; it is also relatively cheap as the "composite microstructure" forms directlJ: from casting with a heat treatment process providing a hardened matrix 3). Another example of a composite material is cemented tungsten carbide; this is manufactured as a true composite, i. e. discrete particles of tungsten carbide are sintered with cobalt particles to form a relatively tough extremely hard material. This combines the hard brittle WC with the relatively soft tough cobalt binder acting as a matrix. This material has the best resistance to abrasive wear of all metallic materials. Ceramics have higher hardness but are significantly more brittle hence their application is limited to erosive rather than abrasive environments. Cemented tungsten carbide inserts are brazed or shrunk into steel holders and used as drill tips for rock drilling; this can be regarded as a composite product, using the strong and tough steel to hold the hard tungsten carbide inserts in place...|$|R

It is, however, important to operate the treatment with low concentration of nutrients in the effluent.

In the reference reactor, a COD reduction of 89 % was achieved and 45. 6 mg NH 4 -N/(g COD reduced) and 11. 6 mg PO 4 -P/(g COD reduced) was consumed at an organic load around 20 kg COD/(m(3.) d). Reduced additions of NH 4 -N decreased the COD reduction. Addition of 56 % of the consumption of NH 4 -N in the reference reactor resulted in a COD reduction of 80 %. The response from decreased addition of PO 4 -P was different compared to NH 4 -N but it could not be determined if this is due to unsuitable experimental design or a different reaction mechanism. Reducing the addition of PO 4 -P to 26 % of the consumption of PO 4 -P in the reference reactor, decreased the COD reduction to 83 %.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{thesis is}} {{the second stage of}} a project to {{investigate}} the parameters affecting the performance of tube mills. The main topics that the project will cover are the motion of the mill charge and the wear characteristics of the mill charge and <b>mill</b> <b>liners.</b> Nates, in his thesis, performed a literature survey that highlighted the need for an investigation into the motion of a particle with emphasis on the response to changes in the coefficient of friction between the particle and the liner. Nates developed theoretical models for a particle moving on the inside of a rotating liner. The models developed were for a block and sphere moving on a flat liner. Although {{a better understanding of the}} motion of a particle was achieved, the models did not take all the variables into account. One of the assumptions made by Nates was that the particle was moving on a flat liner. This thesis concentrates on the motion of a particle on a corrugated liner in a rotating cylinder. Two formulations are presented that model the motion of a particle. The first model assumes that the particle being modelled is a block. The modelling of the particle as a block ensures that the particle does not roll. There are two possibilities as to the type of motion which the block can experience. The first possibility is where the block moves at the same velocity as the - rotating liner whilst the second possibility is where the block can slide relative to the rotating liner. Three different liner configurations were used in the investigation of the motion of a block. The second model assumes that the particle can move with pure rolling as well as with a combination of rolling and sliding. For pure rolling it is assumed that at the point of contact between the sphere and liner that there is no skidding or sliding. The governing equations for the model of a block on a corrugated liner are solved numerically using a Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method. The theoretical predictions of the motion of a block on a corrugated liner are presented - and discussed. The model for a sphere on a corrugated liner was derived but no attempt was made to solve it numerically. It is envisaged that the numerical solution of the model for a sphere will be included in the next stage of the project. An experimental investigation was done to validate the theoretical model for a block on a corrugated liner. Only two of the three liners used in the numerical investigation were tested. There was good correlation between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions. All the experimental results are presented and comparisons made between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The thesis is concluded with a discussion of trends and observations made during the investigation into the motion of a block on a corrugated liner, and it is shown that the model for a block on a corrugated liner does satisfactorily predict the response of the block to varying initial conditions. Suggestions are also made as to possible ways to improve and expand on the current models used to describe the motion of a mill charge...|$|R

40|$|Physically {{realistic}} {{methods are}} a necessity {{to close the}} gap between reality and numerical result in modelling of tumbling mills. A problem is that tumbling mills often operate in a metastable state because of the difficulty to balance the rate of replenishment of large ore particles from the feed with the consumption in the charge. Understanding of the charge motion within the mill is of significance in mill optimisation. Both the breakage of ore particles and the wear of liners/ball media are closely linked to the charge motion. In this work, a ball charge and its interaction with the mill structure is modelled with the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method. The mesh free formulation and the adaptive nature of the SPH method result in a method that handles extremely large deformations and thereby suits modelling of grinding charges and pulp liquids. The flexible rubber lifter and the lining are modelled with the finite element method (FEM). A hyper-elastic model governs the elastic behaviour of the rubber. The comminution process is complex and to include all phenomena that occur in a single numerical model is today not possible. Therefore, modelling the physical interaction between charge, mill structure and pulp liquid is the major goal in this work. The SPH-FEM model can predict responses of the mill structure e. g. stress and strain. All parts of the mill system will affect its response and the model gives the opportunity to study the influence of the mill structure and e. g. pressure and shear stresses in the charge. This computational model also makes it possible to predict, the contact forces for varying <b>mill</b> dimensions, <b>liner</b> combinations and pulp densities. By comparing numerical results with experimental measurement from grinding in a pilot mill equipped with an instrumented rubber lifter a validation is done. The deflection profile of the lifters obtained from SPH-FEM simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to pilot mill measurements as measured by an embedded strain gauge sensor. This model gives information on the grinding process in tumbling mills and better correlation with experimental measurementsGodkänd; 2011; 20111110 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{observation}} of the charge shape and its motion in industrial mills are not possible, it is then customary to use transparent end, small-scale mills (i. e., model mills) to determine the charge trajectory directly by visualization methods. Because of a short length of the model mills, the end-wall effects could introduce a significant bias on the observed charge trajectories and shape. The shorter the mill, the stronger the bias. This {{could be due to}} some material bridging between the end walls. In this research, the end-wall effects were investigated by gradually increasing the model mill length and analysing the charge trajectory and shape variation at a given operating conditions (i. e., ball filling, <b>mill</b> speed, <b>liner</b> type). The unbiased mill length was assumed to be beyond the mill length where no significant change observed in the charge trajectory and shape. For all tests, the torque of the charge was also measured by a torque sensor. The special design of the model mill with the diameter of 100 em made possible to increase the mill length in steps of 3. 6 em up to 21. 6 em. Four types of liners, five steel ball fillings (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 % v/v) and three mill speeds (55, 70, 85 % of critical speed) were tested. The ball sizes ranged from 4 to 12 mm. The results indicated that when the mill length was below 10. 8 em the end walls prevented the charge from free falling. This resulted in lower impact point angles and lower power draws compared with the case of no end-wall effects. When the same experiments were performed using an iron ore instead of balls with the same size range, the impact of end-wall effects was more pronounced. For an increase of 30 % in the speed (from 55 to 85 %), the torque due the change in the charge shape decreased by 41 % (from 3. 7 to 2. 2 kgf. m) when mill filling was 30 %. At the same operating conditions when steel balls used the torque decreased only by 19 % (from 9 to 7. 2 kgf. m). This was expected due to irregular shapes of the ore particles which facilitated bridging. Three-dimensional DEM simulations also resulted in the similar conclusions...|$|R
40|$|For a {{long time}} {{discrete}} element methods (DEM) {{has been used as}} simulation tools to gain insight into particulate flow processes. The mechanical behaviour in tumbling mills is complex. To include all phenomena that occur in a single numerical model is today not possible. A common approach is to model milling charges using the DEM assuming a rigid mill structure. To close the gap between reality and numerical models in milling, more physically realistic methods have to be used. In this work, the finite element method (FEM) and the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method are used together to model a ball mill charge in a tumbling mill. The mesh free formulation and the adaptive nature of the SPH method result in a method that handles extremely large deformations and thereby suits for modelling of grinding charges. The flexible rubber lifter and the lining are modelled with the finite element method. The mill structure consists of rubber lifter and liners and a mantel made of solid steel. For the elastic behaviour of the rubber, a Blatz-Ko hyper-elastic model is used. The supplier of the lining provided experimental data for the rubber. The deflection profile of the lifters obtained from SPH-FEM simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to pilot mill measurements as measured by an embedded strain gauge sensor. This computational model makes it possible to predict charge pressure and shear stresses within the charge. It is also possible to predict contact forces for varying <b>mill</b> dimensions and <b>liner</b> combinations. Godkänd; 2011; 20110717 (parj...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{industry}} needs to implement several concurrent strategies. In particular, the industry {{can be expected}} to view recycling as a central part of its activities. These activities will be focused on the intense demand of chemical and biochemical strategies to enhance bonding within paper and paperboard. Nowadays, on average, 55 % of fibrous compositions for papermaking are made of recycled fibers. In this field, about 65 - 70 % are fibrous compositions intended to be used for packaging papermaking. Corrugated cardboard {{is one of the most}} significant examples, since it is made of fluting (internal part) and test liner (external part). In test <b>liner</b> <b>mills,</b> fibrous compositions are made of 50 % paper cuts from the cardboard industry and the rest of other types of paper and cardboard. Some test liner papers have low content of mineral fillers. While recycling, fibers get damaged due to the hornification phenomena and mechanical refining of the pulp (with the purpose of enhancing the mechanical properties). The producer does not have many alternatives to address this situation: to increase the quality of the pulp, to slightly refine the pulp or to add some chemical additives that enhance mechanical properties. One strategy or alternative to this situation could be biorefining processes of the pulp. The present work aims to biorefine a pulp made of recycled fibers with the purpose of restoring the mechanical properties of the industrial test liner or improving them and making possible the addition of mineral fillers in order to decrease the production costs. It was observed that, at best, the tensile strength improved by 55 % with regard to the original breaking length of the industrial test line...|$|R
40|$|One area in AG/SAG milling field {{which has}} {{received}} a great attention is the optimum liner design for any application to increase the availability of mills. Since the wear profile is not uniform, the modified version of a specially designed measuring device was introduced which accurately determines the wear profile at any given point along the liner length. The procedure to build the 3 -D liner wear profile was also outlined. Upon finding appropriate models, which accurately described the wear rate of the liners, {{with the objective of}} arriving at the uniform liner profile at the liner removal time, new liner designs were proposed. These not only increased the liner life time but they also decreased the scrap metal content. For any new liner design the charge behavior was studied to evaluate the location of the ball impacts. Application of the proposed method in a 9. 75 × 4. 88 m SAG mill indicated that the liner wear profile along the liner length was non-uniform and the highest wear occurred between 1. 25 m and 2. 75 m of the <b>mill</b> length. The <b>liners</b> {{of the first half of}} the mill from the feed end showed more wear (19. 1 g/t) compared to that of the second half (17. 1 g/t). The proposed liners unlike the pervious type did not have a uniform shape and the lifter height was increased from 152 mm to 187 mm at the section where the wear rate was high. It was believed that this new profile could arrive at a uniform profile at the liner change out time. The simulation of charge motion indicated that the impact position of charge will change only one degree due to an increase of 10 to 35 mm in the lifter height. It was predicated that the amount of scrap metal will reduce to 30 % from the current value of 47 % and on average the liner life time will increase by 1500 h...|$|R
