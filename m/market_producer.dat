The analysis of market integration and marked leader applied the method of co-integration and Granger causality test (Engle and Granger model (1987)). The results of the price behavior showed price of red Chili commodity is relative fluctuation. The value of the coefficient of variation (CV) in the consumers area (CV = 42, 35 %) is smaller than in the producer area (CV = 64, 41 %).

One noteworthy feature of these algorithms is that, due to the special structure of the problem, the restricted equilibrium for each supply market (or demand market) can be obtained explicitly in closed form; another feature is that they are intuitive and straightforward to implement. Moreover, the computational results demonstrate that the algorithms are efficient and suitable for large-scale problems...|$|E

40|$|Subsidy {{reform has}} been a key {{component}} of the pre-accession reform agenda of the 10 new member states that joined the EU in 2004 (EU- 10). During the pre-accession period, these countries had to undertake a number of important structural reforms in their economies. One of the most critical reforms was to reduce, and in some cases, eliminate their subsidy programs. This paper analyzes how key subsidy reforms (in state aid to enterprises, agriculture, energy, and transportation) were carried out in the EU- 10 during 1995 – 2005, and explains observed variations across types of subsidies and across countries. Based on an extensive qualitative analysis, the paper draws lessons for future successful reforms of government subsidies. 32 BEuropean Union;Agricultural subsidies;Economic reforms;subsidies, subsidy, energy subsidies, energy subsidy, subsidization, tariff increases, consumer subsidies, internal <b>market,</b> <b>producer</b> subsidies, import duties, transition period, cash transfers, indirect subsidies, transport services, price liberalization, export subsidies, electricity subsidies, production subsidies, transport sector, transport company, safety nets, price subsidy, competition policies, transport costs, trade restrictions, transport companies, political economy, commercialization, competition rules, trade union, tariff structure, price subsidies, increasing trade, average tariff, absence of competition, social safety nets, national laws, input subsidies, full liberalization, social safety net, safety net, free competition, food industry, bilateral contracts, transport operators, interest groups, international standards, common market, competitive pressures...|$|E

Until recently {{there is a new}} design trend for furniture product and design has changes {{a lot of time to}} follow the trend. To solve these problems, so we must develop modular design system for furniture product as the effective problem solving. In this research we use the functional base product development which is concerning the voice of customer to make. But with so many components from furniture products content, with so many forms and material variation, it is become new problem for the producer. How to choose and pick up the material and the component with the least pollutant content. In this research the technical attribute was added to help designer making decision which product is going to be make, when the product still in preliminary ideas stage to support green lifecycle engineering. With algorithm genetic it is very helpful to find our the shortest path from assembly line for each component and the mechanism of making the computer table. The result is we find that the computer table with glass and aluminium 100 % recycled is the best material for computer table with the least pollutant affected to the environment. Further more to fit up that the product is the green product, so the product must has green material analysis. Finally we can get the design alternatives which is use the green material and can recommend which alternatives must be make first...|$|E

Using a vector autoregression (VAR) approach, the empirics analyze the joint time-series behavior of the euro exchange rate and a system of euro-area prices in response to an exchange rate shock. The impulse-response functions from the VAR estimates are used to identify-in a ''new open economy macroeconomics model''-those key behavioral parameters that best replicate the pattern of exchange rate pass-through in the euro area. Area-wide prices are found to display incomplete pass-through, consistent with euro currency-pricing and pricing-to-market behavior. The results are compared to those for the other major industrial economies, and suggest that, as with the United States, "expenditure-switching" effects on the current account still operate but are generally small.

40|$|This paper uses {{disaggregated}} trade data {{to assess}} how the expansion of China''s production capacity and its changing production structure may be affecting its trade linkages with other countries. It finds that China is moving away from traditional assembly operations in its processing activities and its exports have started to rely more on domestically sourced components. In turn, China''s imports and exports have begun to delink, with increased domestic sourcing contributing to the recent increase in its trade balance. In addition, as China moves up the value chain, both its imports and exports have become more sophisticated than in the past. As {{a result of these}} shifts, China may be becoming more exposed to fluctuations in the strength of the global economy, and changes in its exchange rate could have a bigger impact on the trade balance and the domestic economy than commonly believed.
