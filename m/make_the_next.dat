5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E

Due to the number of new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried to convince everyone to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> album a double album. In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with Neil Young producer Elliot Mazer in San Francisco. While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with Murmur producers Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.|$|E

But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed, and which he drilled into us at every practice session. It was: 'Up and out in two, boys.'

500|$|Preliminary {{work for}} Tales of Vesperia began in 2005 during the later {{development}} stages of Tales of the Abyss, which released that year. Due {{to the success}} of Abyss, Vesperia was initially planned as a title for the PlayStation 2. However, upon seeing the projected lifespan of sixth-generation consoles, the executives at Namco Bandai informed the team that Abyss would be the last Tales title of that generation. In addition to this, the team felt limited by the previous generation's hardware. In response, they decided to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> flagship installment on next-generation hardware. At the time when a platform was chosen, the PlayStation 3 had yet to be shown to the company and the Xbox 360 was highly popular in the west, so they settled on the latter.

During areas of development, the team were in communication with Microsoft about how to best utilize the platform. Full development began in May 2006, taking approximately two years to complete.

500|$|Day of the Tentacle was a {{moderate}} commercial success; according to Schafer, it sold around 80,000 copies upon release. The game was critically acclaimed. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote in September 1993, [...] "Calling Day of the Tentacle {{a sequel to}} Maniac Mansion [...] {{is a little like}} calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot". He enjoyed the game's humor and interface, and praised the designers for removing [...] "dead end" [...] scenarios and player character death. Ardai lauded the voice acting, writing that it [...] "would have done the late Mel Blanc proud", and compared the game's humor, animation, and camera angles to [...] "Looney Toons [...] gems from the 40's and 50's". He concluded, [...] "I expect that this game will keep entertaining people for quite some time to come". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that Sanders's Bernard was among [...] "many other inspired performances", concluding that [...] "Chuck Jones would be proud". Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics [...] "are in a stupendous cartoony style", while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as [...] "excellent". Although the reviewer considered it [...] "one of the best" [...] graphic adventure games, he noted that, like LucasArts' earlier Loom, it was extremely short; he wrote that he [...] "felt cheated somehow when I finished the game". He ended the review, [...] "Go, Lucasfilm! Do this again, but do <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> game longer!".|$|E

[...] Notable among the Lancashire urban churches are StMatthew and StJames, Mossley Hill, Liverpool (1870–75), described by Pollard as [...] "one of the best Victorian churches in Liverpool, StMichael and All Angels, Howe Bridge, Atherton (1875–77), considered by Pollard {{to be one of}} Paley and Austin's [...] "most stimulating churches", and StJohn the Baptist, also in Atherton (1878–79), of which Pollard says [...] "The whole is monumental, one of Paley and Austin's best", with a tower that is [...] "magnificently mighty". [...] In Astley Bridge, Bolton, they built two churches, which are described by Hartwell et al. as being [...] "remarkable"; these were All Souls (1878–81), which is now redundant, and StSaviour (1882–85), which was demolished in 1975. [...] StJames, Daisy Hill, Westhoughton (1879–81) is considered by Hartwell et al. as [...] "a masterly performance for relatively little cash", and StPeter, Westleigh Leigh (1879–81) is described by Pollard as one of Paley and Austin's [...] "most radical and thrilling churches". [...] Meanwhile, in rapidly growing Barrow, they had built four smaller churches to a common design, each dedicated to one of the Four Evangelists.

A.B. later told BuzzFeed how he had to [...] "outdo" [...] himself to remain her principal record producer. Owing to Entre a Mi Mundos commercial success, and its career-launching single [...] "Como la Flor", A.B. found it [...] "difficult" [...] to produce another successful recording.
