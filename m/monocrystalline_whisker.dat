50|$|A <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>whisker</b> is a {{filament}} {{of material}} that is structured as a single, defect-free crystal. Some typical whisker materials are graphite, alumina, iron, silicon carbide and silicon. Single-crystal whiskers of these (and some other) materials are known for having very high tensile strength (on the order of 10 - 20 GPa). Whiskers are used in some composites, but large-scale fabrication of defect-free whiskers is very difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{motivation}} to develop CMCs was {{to overcome the}} problems associated with the conventional technical ceramics like alumina, silicon carbide, aluminium nitride, silicon nitride or zirconia - they fracture easily under mechanical or thermo-mechanical loads because of cracks initiated by small defects or scratches. The crack resistance is - like in glass - very low. To increase the crack resistance or fracture toughness, particles (so-called <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>whiskers</b> or platelets) were embedded into the matrix. However, the improvement was limited, and the products have found application only in some ceramic cutting tools. So far only the integration of long multi-strand fibres has drastically increased the crack resistance, elongation and thermal shock resistance, and resulted in several new applications.|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} {{metal whiskers}} {{have a larger}} versatile field of application than <b>monocrystalline</b> <b>whiskers.</b> Although polycrystalline metal whiskers {{can be used for}} composites, preferably by extrusion in thermoplastics or by infiltration of resins or metals into whisker networks, the chief application at present may be the production and various use of whisker networks. Such networks can be produced up to high degrees of porosity and besides high mechanical strength, they have high inside surfaces and high electric conductivity. There are for instance, applications concerning construction of electrodes for batteries and fuel cells, catalysts and also new heat-exchanger material, capable of preparing fuel oil and gasoline in order to assist a high-efficiency combustion. The technical application of polycrystalline metal whiskers require their modification as well as the construction of a pilot production unit...|$|R
