40|$|<b>Macrosystems</b> ecology is {{the study}} of diverse {{ecological}} phenomena at the scale of regions to continents and their interactions with phenomena at other scales. This emerging subdiscipline addresses ecological questions and environmental problems at these broad scales. Here, we describe this new field, show how it relates to modern ecological study, and highlight opportunities that stem from taking a <b>macrosystems</b> perspective. We present a hierarchical framework for investigating <b>macrosystems</b> at any level of ecological organization and in relation to broader and finer scales. Building on well-established theory and concepts from other subdisciplines of ecology, we identify feedbacks, linkages among distant regions, and interactions that cross scales of space and time as the most likely sources of unexpected and novel behaviors in <b>macrosystems.</b> We present three examples that highlight the importance of this multiscaled systems perspective for understanding the ecology of regions to continents. © The Ecological Society of America...|$|R

The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and <b>macrosystem.</b> Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. Microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem.

40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to <b>macrosystems</b> called paramacrosystems with states of finite {{capacity}} and distinguishable and undistinguishable elements with stochastic behavior. The paramacrosystems fill a gap between Fermi and Einstein <b>macrosystems.</b> Using the method of the generating functions, we have obtained expressions for probabilistic characteristics (distribution of the macrostate probabilities, physical and information entropies) of the paramacrosystems. The cases with equal and unequal prior probabilities for elements to occupy the states with finite capacities are considered. The unequal prior probabilities influence the morphological properties of the entropy functions and {{the functions of the}} macrostate probabilities, transforming them in the multimodal functions. The examples of the paramacrosystems with two-modal functions of the entropy and distribution of the macrostate probabilities are presented. The variation principle does not work for such cases...|$|R
40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in deutscher Sprache hinterlegt.) Günther Ludwig regards quantum {{mechanics}} to {{be a special}} theory between two types of <b>macrosystems,</b> {{one of these is}} preparation and the other one is registration. <b>Macrosystems</b> are objects which can be described by immediate instructions or by terms of classical physics. Thus {{quantum mechanics}} is grounded in a radical way on a realistic basis which refers entirely to the macroscopic- phenomenological reality. A microscopic reality is not assumed. The current thesis discusses the central aspects of Ludwig's approach towards a new foundation of quantum mechanics. This new foundation shows to be efficient in two fields. On the one hand it is possible to gain an axiomatic construction of quantum mechanics up to Hilbertspace and Schrödingers equation by physically motivated statements. On the other hand problems of interpretation can be circumvented...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} awareness of the important and persuasive role that instability and random, chaotic motion play in the dynamics of <b>macrosystems.</b> Further {{research in the field}} should aim at providing useful tools, and therefore the motivation should come from important questions arising in specific <b>macrosystems.</b> Such systems include biochemical networks, genetic mechanisms, biological communities, neutral networks, cognitive processes and economic structures. This list may seem heterogeneous, but there are similarities between evolution in the different fields. It is not surprising that mathematical methods devised in one field {{can also be used to}} describe the dynamics of another. IIASA is attempting to make progress in this direction. With this aim in view this workshop was held at Laxenburg over the period 3 - 7 September 1984.

50|$|The <b>macrosystem</b> is {{composed}} of cultural values, customs and laws. It refers to the overall patterns of ideology and organization that characterize a given society or social group. Macrosystems {{can be used to}} describe the cultural or social context of various societal groups such as social classes, ethnic groups, or religious affiliates. This layer is the outermost layer in the child's environment. The effects of larger principles defined by the <b>macrosystem</b> have a cascading influence throughout the interactions of all other layers. The <b>macrosystem</b> influences what, how, when and where we carry out our relations. For example, a program like Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may positively impact a young mother through health care, vitamins, and other educational resources. It may empower her life so that she, in turn, is more affective and caring with her newborn. In this example, without an umbrella of beliefs, services, and support for families, children and their parents are open to great harm and deterioration. In a sense, the macrosytem that surrounds us helps us to hold together the many threads of our lives.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model (referred as Ψ - model for convenience) has been developed, which allows describing certain class of micro- and <b>macrosystems.</b> Ψ - model {{is based on}} continuum and quantum mechanics. Ψ - model describes micro- and <b>macrosystems,</b> in which vector field of velocities of probability flows, charge, mass has specific spiral structure. The field of velocities has spiral structure on concentric spherical surfaces. The velocity field is not defined and has a characteristic property on the poles of sphere and on the axis and tends to zero at infinity.

The application of Ψ - model to the description of elementary particles gives naturally the intrinsic magnetic moment (spin) without need in modification of g-factor.

For a physicist the fundamental challenge is to learn about microsystems and discover the basic links; what remains is to face complexity: correlations of simple properties of single microsystems provide all describable variety. One expects that this scheme can be reproduced at smaller time-scales, to leave open the adventure of discerning more remote links.
