40|$|BACKGROUND: Sanfilippo syndrome, or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>III,</b> {{is a rare}} {{lysosomal}} storage disease, {{resulting from}} errors in the catabolism of heparan sulphate. Aim: To evaluate bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) in MPS <b>type</b> <b>III</b> patients. DESIGN: Clinical and observational study. METHODS: We evaluated serum markers of bone formation or resorption, and measured BMD using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), in three patients with MPS <b>type</b> <b>III.</b> RESULTS: Serum vitamin D were low, and BMDs greatly reduced at lumbar and femoral sites, indicating the possibility of osteoporosis and osteomalacia.

Methods Actigraphic data were recorded in eight children with MPS III over 7 – 10 days and compared to age-matched typically developing controls. Parameters of circadian rhythmicity and activity levels across a 24 -h period were analysed. Results Statistically and clinically {{significant differences between the two}} groups were noted. Analysis indicated that children with MPS III showed significantly increased fragmentation of circadian rhythm and reduced stability with external cues (zeitgebers), compared to controls. Average times of activity onset and offset were indicative of a phase delayed sleep-wake cycle for some children in the MPS III group. Children with MPS III had significantly higher activity levels during the early morning hours (midnight– 6 am) compared to controls. Conclusions Results are consistent with previous research into MPS III and suggest that there is an impairment in circadian rhythm functioning in children with this condition.

The primary characteristic of MPS III is the degeneration of the central nervous system, resulting in mental retardation and hyperactivity, typically commencing during childhood. The significance {{of the order of}} events leading from heparan sulfate accumulation through to downstream changes in the levels of biomolecules within the cell and ultimately the (predominantly neuropathological) clinical symptoms is not well understood. The genes whose deficiencies cause the MPS III subtypes have been identified, and their gene products, as well as a selection of disease-causing mutations, have been characterized to varying degrees with respect to both frequency and direct biochemical consequences. A number of genetic and biochemical diagnostic methods have been developed and adopted by diagnostic laboratories. However, there is no effective therapy available for any form of MPS III, with treatment currently limited to clinical management of neurological symptoms. The availability of animal models for all forms of MPS III, whether spontaneous or generated via gene targeting, has contributed to improved understanding of the MPS III subtypes, and has provided and will deliver invaluable tools to appraise emerging therapies. Indeed, clinical trials to evaluate intrathecally-delivered enzyme replacement therapy in MPS IIIA patients, and gene therapy for MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB patients are planned or underway.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS III), or Sanfilippo syndrome, is a {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} in which heparan sulfate is accumulated in lysosomes, {{as well as}} outside of cells, as the primary storage material. This disease is a complex of four conditions caused by dysfunctions of one of genes coding for lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of heparan sulfate: SGSH (coding for heparan N-sulfatase) – causing MPS IIIA, NAGLU (coding for -N-acetylglucosaminidase) - causing MPS IIIB, HGSNAT (coding for acetyl CoA -glucosaminide acetyltransferase) - causing MPS IIIC), and GNS (coding for N-acetylglucosamine- 6 -sulfatase) – causing MPS IIID. The primary storage is responsible for some disease symptoms, but other arise {{as a result of}} secondary storage, including glycosphingolipids, and subsequent processes, like oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Central nervous system is predominantly affected in all subtypes of MPS III. Heparan sulfate and its derivatives are the most commonly used biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction procedures.

40|$|Sanfilippo A {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} four recognised Sanfilippo sub-types (A, B, C and D) that result from deficiencies of different enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulphate; patients suffer from severe neurological disorders. The Sanfilippo syndrome sub-types are also known as <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS-IIIA, B, C and D), and are part of the large group of lysosomal storage disorders. Each of the MPS-III types is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with considerable variation in severity of clinical phenotype. The incidence of Sanfilippo syndrome has been estimated at 1 : 24, 000 in The Netherlands with MPS IIIA (MIM # 252900) the most common. MPS-IIIA is the predominant MPS-III in the United Kingdom, and has a similar high incidence to that found in The Netherlands (E. Wraith, personal communication). There is a particularly high incidence of a clinically severe form of MPS-IIIA in the Cayman Islands with a carrier frequency of 0. 1 (ref. 4). Due to the mild somatic disease compared to other MPS disorders there is difficulty in diagnosing mild cases of MPS-III, hence Sanfilippo syndrome may be underdiagnosed, especially in patients with mild mental retardation. Here, we report the isolation, sequence and expression of cDNA clones encoding the enzyme sulphamidase (EC 3. 10. 1. 1). In addition, we report the chromosomal localisation of the sulphamidase gene as being 17 q 25. 3.

Actigraphic data revealed that children with MPS III had significantly longer sleep onset latencies and greater daytime sleep compared to controls, but night-time sleep duration did not differ between groups. In the MPS III group, sleep efficiency declined, and sleep onset latency increased, with age. Questionnaire responses showed that MPS III patients had significantly more sleep difficulties in all domains compared to controls. Melatonin concentrations showed an alteration in the circadian system in MPS III, which suggests that treatment for sleep problems should attempt to synchronise the sleep-wake cycle to a more regular pattern.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS III), or Sanfilippo disease, is a {{neurodegenerative}} lysosomal {{storage disease}} (LSD) caused by defective lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate (HS). No effective disease-modifying therapy is yet available. In contrast to some other neuronopathic LSDs, bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) fails to prevent neurological deterioration in MPS III patients. We report on the 5 -year outcome of early transplantation, i. e., before onset of clinical neurological disease, {{in combination with the}} use of umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells (UCBT), in two MPS III patients. Both patients had a normal developmental quotient at the time of UCBT. One patient had a combination of mutations predicting a classical severe phenotype (MPS IIIA), and one patient (MPS IIIB) had mutations predicting a very attenuated phenotype. Transplantation was uncomplicated with full engraftment of donor cells in both. Both patients showed progressive neurological deterioration with regression of cognitive skills and behavioral disturbances during 5 years after successful UCBT, comparable to the natural history of patients with the same combination of mutations. The concentration of HS in CSF in the patient with the attenuated phenotype of MPS IIIB 2 years after UCBT was very high and in the range of untreated MPS III patients. We conclude that the course of cognitive development, behavioral problems, and absence of biochemical correction in CSF demonstrate the absence of relevant effect of UCBT in MPS III patients, even when performed before clinical onset of CNS diseas...|$|E
40|$|Sanfilippo disease (<b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III,</b> MPS III) is {{a severe}} {{metabolic}} disorder caused by accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS), one of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), {{due to a}} genetic defect resulting in a deficiency of GAG hydrolysis. This disorder is characterized as the most severe neurological form of MPS, revealing rapid deterioration of brain functions. Among therapeutic approaches for MPS III, {{one of the most}} promising appears to be the substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Genistein (5, 7 -dihydroxy- 3 - (4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one) is an isoflavone that has been used in SRT for MPS III. In this report, we tested effects of other flavonoids (apigenin, daidzein, kaempferol and naringenin) on GAG synthesis. Their cytotoxicity and anti-proliferation features were also tested. We found that daidzein and kaempferol inhibited GAG synthesis significantly. Moreover, these compounds were able to reduce lysosomal storage in MPS IIIA fibroblasts. Interestingly, although genistein is believed to inhibit GAG synthesis by blocking the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we found that effects of other flavonoids were not due to this mechanism. In fact, combinations of various flavonoids resulted in significantly more effective inhibition of GAG synthesis than the use of any of these compounds alone. These results, together with results published recently by others, suggest that combination of flavonoids can be considered as a method for improvement of efficiency of SRT for MPS III...|$|E

The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age.

Genistein has been proposed as potential therapy but its efficacy remains uncertain. We aimed to determine the efficacy of genistein in MPS III. Methods: Thirty patients were enrolled. Effects of genistein were determined in a randomized, crossover, placebocontrolled intervention with a genistein-rich soy isoflavone extract (10 mg/kg/day of genistein) followed by an openlabel extension study for patients who were on genistein during {{the last part of}} the crossover. Results: Genistein resulted in a significant decrease in urinary excretion of total GAGs (p 0. 02, slope = 0. 68 mg GAGs/mmol creatinine/mo) and in plasma concentrations of HS (p 0. 01, slope = 15. 85 ng HS/ml/mo). No effects on total behavior scores or on hair morphology were observed. Parents or caregivers could not predict correctly during which period of the crossover a patient was on genistein. Interpretation: Genistein at 10 mg/kg/day effectively reduces urinary excretion of GAGs and plasma HS concentration in patients with MPS III. However, the absolute reduction in GAGs and in HS is small and values after 12 months of treatment remain within the range as observed in untreated patients. No clinical efficacy was detected.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder, {{caused by a}} deficiency {{in one of the}} four enzymes involved in the lysosomal degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate. Based on the enzyme deficiency, four different subtypes, MPS IIIA, B, C, and D, are recognized. The genes encoding these four enzymes have been characterized and various mutations have been reported. The probable diagnosis of all MPS III subtypes is based on increased concentration of heparan sulfate in the urine. Enzymatic assays in leukocytes and/or fibroblasts confirm the diagnosis and allow for discrimination between the different subtypes of the disease. The clinical course of MPS III can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, which usually starts between 1 and 4 years of age, a developmental delay becomes apparent after an initial normal development during the first 1 - 2 years of life. The second phase generally starts around 3 - 4 years and is characterized by severe behavioural problems and progressive mental deterioration ultimately leading to severe dementia. In the third and final stage, behavioural problems slowly disappear, but motor retardation with swallowing difficulties and spasticity emerge. Patients usually die {{at the end of the}} second or beginning of the third decade of life, although survival into the fourth decade has been reported.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS III or Sanfilippo {{syndrome}} or Sanfilippo disease) {{is caused}} by a deficiency in one of four enzymes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) degradation, leading to lysosomal HS accumulation. MPS III is characterized by severe central nervous system (CNS) disease, leading to progressive neurocognitive deterioration. Patients show a broad spectrum of disease progression and severity. To date, no disease modifying treatment is available for MPS III. Areas covered: An overview of the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MPS III is presented. We discuss the different therapies for MPS III which are currently being investigated, either in animal models or in clinical trials and the advantages and limitations of each therapeutic approach. Expert opinion: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the bottleneck in the development of drugs for MPS III and a number of very promising approaches to target the BBB are currently studied. To assess the full therapeutic potentials of any drug or combination of drugs, trials including very early diagnosed or even fully asymptomatic patients in combination with information on the natural history of the disease are necessary. However, almost all MPS III patients are diagnosed because of developmental delay with behavioral difficulties. At that time substantial and irreversible damage to the central nervous system (CNS) may already be present. In the best case scenario, disease-modifying therapy may only halt disease progression. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are therefore essential.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessively inherited disorder composed {{at least}} by four different subtypes: type A (OMIM # 252900), type B (OMIM # 252920), type C (OMIM # 252930) and type D (OMIM # 252940). Each subtype {{is caused by a}} deficiency in a different enzyme involved in the catabolic pathway for heparan sulfate. From the clinical point of view, type III patients can be classified within the MPS neurodegenerative phenotype, given visceromegaly, coarse facies, joint disease and bone dysplasia are relatively mild and progresses steadily. Behavioural disturbances and hyperactivity are often reported {{in the early stages of}} the disease. Objectives: The aim of this study is to draw the attention to the several subtypes which may be diagnosed within type III MPS, pointing out for mucopolysacharidosis-like patients with unclear etiology. Methods: MPS type III patients are diagnosed by the quantification of GAG heparan sulfate in urine, identification of the enzymatic deficiency in peripheral blood and gene sequencing for causal mutations. Results: From 34 MPS type III families, 4 patients were found to be IIIA, 24 IIIB and 6 IIIC. Type IIIB is the most common, accounting for 70 % of all Portuguese cases with MPS III. Conclusions: Biochemical and molecular characterization allows carrier identification and informed family planning decisions.

Thirty-three patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent an X-ray of the pelvis (anteroposterior view). All the X-rays were evaluated by a single, blinded radiologist using a modified Ficat classification system for ONFH (the stages ranged from 0 to IV, with increasing stages signifying more severe abnormalities). Clinical symptoms possibly related to hip disease were recorded. The patients were divided into different phenotypes based on mutational analysis and their plasma heparan sulfate (HS) levels. In 21 of the 33 patients, the disease severity could be predicted by genotype. In 11 of the 12 remaining patients, the phenotype could be assessed via the plasma HS levels. Eight patients (24 %) exhibited signs of ONFH (Ficat stage≥I), and 6 (75 %) of them had bilateral changes. None of the patients with attenuated MPS III (n= 14) had ONFH. In 6 of the patients with a severe phenotype, hip dysplasia was detected as an additional finding. The 7 patients with Ficat stages ≥ II reported hip pain. Femoral head disease, which resembles ONFH, is common in patients with the severe MPS III phenotype. An evaluation of hip disease should be included in follow-up visits with MPS III patient...|$|E
40|$|The Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a {{class of}} {{lysosomal}} storage disorders, characterized by the primary lysosomal storage of either single or multiple species of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) which leads to cell, tissue, and organ dysfunction. This is manifested clinically by either bone/connective tissue disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease, or both, and often results in premature death. <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> is a heterogeneous neuropathological disorder characterized by an accumulation of the heparan sulfate (HS). Of the four known types of MPS III in humans (A (OMIM: 252900), B (252920), C (252930), D (252940)), all have murine models except IIID. Additional to primary HS storage there is secondary lysosomal accumulation of multiple biological products including gangliosides. Mouse models are critical for advancing therapies for patients. Herein we describe the first mouse model of IIID. The MPS IIID knockout lacks exons 2 - 13 of the 14 exons of N-Acetylglucosamine 6 -Sulfatase (GNS) gene which encodes the enzyme (N-Acetylglucosamine 6 -Sulfatase, EC 3. 1. 6. 14) taking part in HS degradation pathway. Affected MPS IIID mice were compared to affected MPS IIIB and IIIA mice, {{as well as to}} wild type (WT) mice. Affected IIID animals had urine retention, hepatomegaly, and rough hair coat beginning at nine months, a phenotype similar to other forms of MPS III. Affected animals were further characterized by histology and biochemistry (at four, eight and twelve months), and behavior. At four months of age there was no detectable liver activity of GNS and an exponential increase of GAGs was seen. Mild vacuolation, particularly in CNS, was seen in hematoxylin and eosin (H 2 ̆ 6 E) stained tissues of IIID affected mice. At twelve months H 2 ̆ 6 E staining showed extensive vacuolation in hepatocytes, renal tubular cells, CNS, as well as cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining of CNS tissue showed positive staining for glycosphingolipids. The preliminary behavioral assessment data showed that IIID mice perform better on rotorod at least until 12 months of age compared to IIIB mice. Our findings of IIID mouse are consistent with the histological and biochemical findings in humans. Furthermore, it has a similar phenotype and pathology to other MPS III murine models...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular disease, a {{progressive}} manifestation of α-L-iduronidase deficiency or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I, continues in patients both untreated and treated with {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation or intravenous enzyme replacement. Few {{studies have examined the}} effects of α-L-iduronidase deficiency and subsequent glycosaminoglycan storage upon arterial gene expression to understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules. Genes were further categorized based on module-trait relationships. Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation. Significantly downregulated genes were related to cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium regulation. Clusterin gene overexpression (9 -fold) and protein overexpression (1. 3 to 1. 62 -fold) was confirmed and located specifically in arterial plaques of mucopolysaccharidosis-affected dogs and mice. Overexpression of lysosomal and proteasomal-related genes are expected responses to cellular stress induced by lysosomal storage in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I. Upregulation of immunity-related genes implicates the potential involvement of glycosaminoglycan-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of mucopolysaccharidosis-related arterial disease, for which clusterin represents a potential biomarker...|$|R
