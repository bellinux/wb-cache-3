5|$|Menkauhor Kaiu built {{a pyramid}} in North-Saqqara, thereby abandoning the royal {{necropolis}} of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty {{had been buried}} since the reign of Sahure, some 80 years earlier. The reason for this choice <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Abusir plateau had become overcrowded {{by the beginning of}} Menkauhor's reign.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.|$|E

5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 260-day count {{is based on the}} human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It may be that manipulation can cause dissection, or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E
30|$|Thus, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{effect of}} pyrolysis {{pressure on the}} gasification reactivity of char is not systematically proven.|$|R
30|$|It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> suspicious deteriorations {{and cracks}} which are referable to hot weather would {{be due to}} other factors.|$|R

5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of Ellandun {{went beyond the}} immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the Chronicle, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually {{have been in the}} following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.|$|E

5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E

25|$|In 1897 a Han Dynasty stone sundial was {{discovered}} in Inner Mongolia which had been overcarved with a Liubo board pattern. The only other complete Han dynasty sundial, {{in the collection of}} the Royal Ontario Museum, also has a Liubo pattern carved on it. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sundials were repurposed as Liubo boards by carving the Liubo pattern over the original sundial markings, or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Liubo markings were added for some unknown ritual purpose.|$|E
