By using of thermodynamic and heat transfer design methods, the key parameters of the designed Stirling engine like required surfaces for heat transfer were calculated (hot side 307 and the cold side 243 squares of centimeters). For analysis of fluid flow, two-dimensional flow analysis method was performed by the software CFD methods.

40|$|The {{ignition}} of Al/CuO multilayered {{material is}} studied experimentally {{to explore the}} effect of heating surface area, layering and film thickness on the ignition characteristics and reaction performances. After {{the description of the}} micro-initiator devices and ignition conditions, we show that the heating surface area has to be properly calibrated to optimize the nanothermite ignition performances. We demonstrated experimentally that a heating surface area of 0. 25 mm 2 is sufficient to ignite a multilayered thermite film of 1. 6 mm wide by a few cm long, with a success rate of 100 %. A new analytical and phenomenological ignition model based on atomic diffusion across layers and thermal exchange is also proposed. This model considers that CuO first decomposes into Cu 2 O, the oxygen diffusing across Cu 2 O and Al 2 O 3 layers before reaching the Al layer where it reacts to form Al 2 O 3. The theoretical results in terms of <b>ignition</b> response <b>times</b> confirm the experimental observation. The increase of the heating surface area leads to an increase of the <b>ignition</b> response <b>time</b> and <b>ignition</b> power threshold (go/no go condition). We also evidence that for any heating surface area, the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> rapidly decreases when the electrical power density increases until an asymptotic value, named <b>minimum</b> response <b>ignition</b> <b>time,</b> which is a characteristic of the multilayered thermite itself. At the stoichiometric ratio (Al thickness is half of CuO one), the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> response <b>time</b> can be easily tuned from 59 µs to 418 ms by tuning the heating surface area. The <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> response <b>time</b> increases when the bilayer thickness increases. Not only this work gives a set of micro-initiator design rules to obtain the best ignition conditions and reaction performances but it also details a reliable and robust MEMS process to fabricate igniters and it brings new understanding of phenomena governing the ignition process of Al/CuO multilayers...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} isolated n-heptane droplets autoignition {{have been conducted}} at pressures of 5 and 10 atm for several values of the initial ambient gas temperature. The ignition modes considered included low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature ignition. The analysis was conducted from a mixture-fraction perspective. For sufficiently low values of the ambient gas temperature, two-stage ignition was observed. Under these conditions, low-temperature reactions {{played an important role}} in the transition of the system to a fully burning state. As the initial value of the ambient gas temperature increased, the influence of the low-temperature reactions on the ignition process decreased and eventually became marginal for temperatures above 900 K. Comparisons against homogeneous reactor calculations showed that the ignition location in mixture fraction space could be reasonably predicted for the high-temperature case, whereas discrepancies occurred for the intermediate- and low-temperature ones due to the shift in the maximum reactivity of the system caused by the cool flame appearance. The dependence of the ignition process on the initial droplet diameter was also studied for different values of the initial ambient gas temperature. It was found that, for all cases investigated, a value of the droplet diameter existed for which ignition took the least time to occur. For smaller droplets, the ignition transient was longer and eventually a burning flame did no longer appear when the droplet was initially too small. For the low-temperature case, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> was determined by the competition between the quicker ignition of the cool flame and the longer second induction time resulting from the decrease in the droplet size; for the high-temperature case, it was the results of phenomena occurring early during the droplet lifetime...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} the results of the experimental characterization of the ignition sensitivity of solid inertant/combustible powders mixtures. Three inert solids (alumina, Kieselguhr, aerosil) and eleven organic powders have been considered and the following parameters have been determined: (1) the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy, (2) the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature in cloud and (3) the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature in 5 mm layer. The effects of the addition of inert solids are described and a simple model is proposed to represent the experimental results. Generally, increasing inert solid content in a powder leads to a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy as well as a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperatures in cloud and in layer. In some cases, the flammability is influenced above a threshold concentration value, which can be quite high (up to 85 wt. %).

40|$|Maple plywood {{samples were}} heated in an oven at 180 °C to a {{residual}} weight of 70 %, 50 %, and 30 % of the virgin weight. The virgin plywood and the thermally pretreated samples {{were tested in}} a cone calorimeter over the range of 6 to 15 kW/m 2 {{without the use of}} an ignitor. Tests were conducted until smoldering/glowing combustion was observed or for eight hours if ignition was not observed. The extent of thermal pretreatment of the plywood had no measurable effect on the minimum heat flux for smoldering ignition. At heat fluxes above the <b>minimum</b> for <b>ignition,</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>times</b> were reduced for thermally pretreated samples relative to virgin wood. This is consistent with the thermal pretreatment achieving the charring required as the first step in smoldering ignition and the reduction in thermal inertia resulting from charring. Samples of the virgin and pretreated wood were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The chemical kinetics analysis of the virgin and pretreated samples showed no change in the chemical mechanism.

40|$|As a dust {{explosion}} {{is regarded as}} a serious hazard in the industry, knowing the sensitivity of combustible dusts helps to calculate the explosion risk. Also mixtures of a less flammable dust with a combustible dust are often encountered in the process industries. One of the important parameters in determining the ignition sensitivity is the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy (MIE). The aim of this work is to determine crucial ignition energies for different types of combustible dusts of various particle sizes. Experiments are performed to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy of pure dusts and also of different powder mixtures in air. They illustrate that by adding a small amount of a highly combustible powder (such as niacin, lycopodium and metal powder) with a less flammable powder (such as wood, cacao and South African coal) has a considerable effect on the MIE. There is a significant decrease in <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy when the fraction of the highly combustible dust exceeds 10 %. After mixing with more than 50 % of the highly combustible dust, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy decreases gradually.

Comparisons between experimental and simulated results of <b>ignition</b> <b>times</b> showed that edge effects were significant in the ignition process of the UL- 94 test and the convective heat transfer ignition model considering edge effects gave <b>ignition</b> <b>times</b> close to experimental results. Sensitivity analyses showed that the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> increased linearly with decreasing initial temperature and increasing density, heat capacity and emissivity, but nonlinearly with decreasing flame temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient and increasing thickness, thermal conductivity, and ignition temperature of the specimen...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Minimum</b> <b>Ignition</b> Energy (MIE) of an {{initially}} Gaussian {{temperature profile}} is found both by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) {{and from a}} new novel model. The model is based on solving the heat diffusion equation in zero dimensions for a Gaussian velocity distribution. The chemistry is taken into account through the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time,</b> which is required as input to the model. The model results reproduce the DNS results very well for the Hydrogen mixture investigated. Furthermore, the effect of ignition source dimensionality is explored, and it is shown that for compact ignition kernels {{there is a strong}} effect on dimensionality. Here, three, two and one dimensional ignition sources represent a spherical kernel, a long spark and an ignition sheet, respectively. Comment: Submitted for publication in Combustion and Flam...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ignition</b> <b>times</b> {{and spatial}} and {{temporal}} variations of temperature and concentration in gaseous mixtures confined between two infinite parallel walls or two infinite cylinders have been obtained by numerical integration of the appropriate conservation equations written in Lagrangian coordinates. <b>Ignition</b> <b>times</b> and <b>ignition</b> energies are presented for {{the case of an}} isothermal wall in terms of the initial mixture pressure and equivalence ratio for both one and two-step chemical reaction mechanisms. The numerical results indicate that there is a critical mixture pressure for which the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> is <b>minimum.</b> The values of this critical pressure are larger (smaller) than 1 atm for the one- (two-) step reaction mechanism. The critical pressure for the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> is not equal to the critical pressure for the ignition energy. The <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> and energy decrease with the equivalence ratio within a certain range and then remain constant...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Ignition</b> Energy, in a hydrogen-air system, is studied by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) {{in a program}} called the Pencil Code. The heat source used to achieve {{ignition}} is modeled by a Gaussian temperature distribution. Three different geometries of the heat source are looked upon, one with spherical geometry in three dimensions, one with cylindrical geometry in two dimensions and the last in one dimension. The {{results show that the}} dimensionality of the heat source has a strong impact on ignition. In addition, a new simpler zero dimensional simulation method is proposed with the goal of replicating the results from the Pencil Code. This method needs less calculation power, and uses <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> data together with the heat equation to simulate ignition. The model has proven itself useful since it reproduces the Pencil Code results very well. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{studies the}} {{influence}} of added inert dust on the ignition sensitivity of the combustible/inert dust mixture. Different types of combustible dust of various sizes, such as coal, powdered sugar, lycopodium, anthraquinone, rice and coffee husks, beech wood flour or ground coffee were mixed with alumina and kieselguhr before being tested. Parameters measured were 1) <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature (MIT) in 5 mm layer, 2) <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature in cloud (Godbert-Greenwald oven) and 3) <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy (MIE) (in a Kühner-Mike 3 apparatus). It appears from this study that the MIT in 5 mm layer is strongly influenced by an inert fraction >= 60 % (weight). There is also {{a significant increase in}} MIT in cloud form when the fraction of inert dust exceeds 60 % (weight). This threshold {{is a function of the}} bulk density of the inert substance selected for these tests. However, in cases where the density of the inert dust is different from that of the combustible dust, there appears to be a separation of the two constituents of the mixture after its pneumatic dispersion during the test. As a consequence, {{the influence of}} inert dust is less pronounced in the case of MIT for dust clouds than for the MIT of a dust layer. A similar phenomenon is observed for the MIE of dust clouds...|$|R
