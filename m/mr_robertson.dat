The baby animals have proved {{one of the most}} popular and enduring of the show traditions and has been copied by show societies throughout Australia. At the 1972 Exhibition a purpose-built facility for the animal nursery was opened, named in honour of <b>Mr</b> <b>Robertson.</b>|$|E

50|$|Robertson College {{was founded}} in 1911 after founder M.I. Robertson emigrated from Scotland {{to live with her}} sister and {{brother-in-law}} in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. In Edinburgh, Scotland, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> worked in the city hall. It was thought that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> was married and had a husband who had been a ship’s sea captain, but there is no proof of this. Back then it was not proper protocol to ask, or to speculate private matters. Nonetheless <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> came to Canada with her young daughter.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> saw education {{as a way to}} help young people. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> documents during one of the Saskatchewan Minimum Wage Board Meetings of the concern of young girls coming to the city seeking employment. Many employers were not willing to pay well, and many of these young girls were employed as waitresses, thus long hours. The girls needed a place to sleep, and therefore slept on the floors of their place of employment and still had no money for winter clothing or basic sustenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> {{wrote to}} Amir Khan, {{saying that he}} must leave the Chitral territory. Amir paid no {{attention}} to the order, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> reported this to the government of India. They issued, in March, 1895, a proclamation warning the Chitralis to abstain from giving assistance to Amir Khan, and intimating that a force sufficient to overcome all resistance was being assembled; but that as soon as it had attained its object, it would be withdrawn.|$|E

50|$|In 1931, Barbara Mackenzie, a {{registered}} nurse and midwife trained in New Zealand came to Canada and married Irving Robertson, then Chairman of the Board of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. Together, <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> established the Canadian Mothercraft Society. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> championed the cause of mid-wifery, founded the Mothercraft Well-Baby Nursing Training program, and operated the Mothercraft maternity hospital, and maintained a community registry of Well-Baby Nurses. Well-Baby Nurses aided with breastfeeding, getting infants on schedules, and provided at home child care support. The registry of Well-Baby Nurses was maintained until 1990.|$|R
50|$|In the 1921 Saskatoon Henderson Directory it {{was noted}} that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> began to {{advertise}} her business as Dominion Business College.

5000|$|He was {{described}} in 1953 as [...] "A man of sound scholarship, of Old World dignity and a good simple preacher (who) went about his work steadily ... <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> were a tower of strength, and themselves knew the fellowship of loss and suffering." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{hour after}} this a dog cart came round to the door. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> {{took his place}} in it with his trunk, and was driven away to Exeter, never to return.|$|E
6000|$|The skipper {{rose and}} {{opening the door}} called to a man outside. [...] "I want <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> here," [...] he said. [...] "If he isn't willing or fit to come, you can drag him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Carlyle, ex-Lord Rector of the University of Edinburgh, {{being asked}} before the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} of office, to deliver a valedictory address to the students, he sent the following letter to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson,</b> Vice-President of the Committee for his election:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{has been}} already {{mentioned}} that <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> had removed thither, from their station upon the Umlazi, taking {{with them a}} selection of their Christian Kaffirs, and settling, with the king's permission, {{at a place called}} Kwamagwaza. At first they lived in a waggon and tents, for, delicate and often ill as was <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson,</b> she shrank from no hardship or exertion. She writes, [...] "My own health has been wonderful, in spite of much real suffering from the closeness of the waggon, and exposure to rain or hot sun, which is even more trying. I often have to sleep with the waggon open, and a damp foggy air flowing through to keep me from fainting, and I have often told myself, 'You might be worse off in the cabin of a steamer,' that I might not pity myself too much." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> PATRICK <b>ROBERTSON</b> {{was then}} called to the chair by common acclamation.|$|R
60|$|The squire {{was sitting}} at his table, with his clerk beside him. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> was in a chair a short {{distance}} off. The constable {{was standing by the}} side of James Walsham, {{at the other end of}} the room. Mr. Linthorne nodded to his nephew.|$|E
60|$|After {{which several}} other toasts were given, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> {{left the room}} about half-past eleven. A few choice spirits, however, rallied round Captain Broadhead of the 7th Hussars, who was called to the chair, and the festivity was {{prolonged}} till an early hour on Saturday morning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{think of}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> and such men, and think {{how they work}} on, it {{encourages}} me. And so, where do I hear of men who have so many comforts, so great immunity from hardship and danger as we enjoy? This is nothing {{to the case of}} a London parish.|$|E

6000|$|I {{ought to}} have known better, but, {{although}} a British custom is more honored in the breach than the observance in Western Canada, I had met men who could pocket their pride, and, after fumbling in my wallet, I held out a slip of paper, saying, [...] "She's doing splendidly. I wish you would buy <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> something with this." ...|$|R
60|$|A hut {{was soon}} raised, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> here ruled {{in her own}} peculiarly dignified and tender way {{as the mother of}} the whole station, keeping guard there while her husband went on expeditions to visit the king and his son Ketchewayo, the chief {{executive}} authority. Another hut was raised to serve as a church, and the days were arranged much as those on the Umlazi had been. Children were born to the Christian couples, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> spent much time and care in teaching the mothers how to deal with them after a civilized and Christian fashion. Other children were sometimes brought to her to be adopted, and when entirely made over by their parents were baptized and bred up as Christians. The general trust in Mr. Robertson's skill as a doctor brought many people under his influence, and likewise gave some, though very slight assistance, in combating the belief in witchcraft, the worst enemy with which Christianity has to contend.|$|R

[Footnote 22: Of course, it in {{understood}} that Israel (in the dark backward and abysm of time) {{may also have}} been totemistic, like the Australians, as texts pointed out by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> Smith seem to hint.

6000|$|... 'Now <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> and {{his good}} wife refresh {{one by the}} reality and {{simplicity}} of their life, the simple-mindedness, the absence of all cant and formalism. I mean the formal observance of a certain set of views about the Sabbath, about going to parties, about reading books, &c., the formal utterance of an accepted phraseology.|$|E
60|$|The Chitralis, who now {{preferred}} Sher Afzul to Amir, made {{common cause}} with the former. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> learned that men were already at work, {{breaking up the}} road between Chitral and Mastuj; and accordingly moved from the house he had occupied to the fort, which was large enough to receive the force with him.|$|E

60|$|The first ascents for {{scientific}} purposes were made about {{the beginning of the}} present century. In 1803, <b>Mr</b> <b>Robertson</b> ascended from Saint Petersburg, for the purpose of making electrical, magnetical, and physiological experiments. Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot followed his example from Paris, in 1804. Gay-Lussac was an enthusiastic and celebrated aeronaut. He made several interesting ascents.|$|E
60|$|Richard {{had thought}} over {{whether it would}} be better to soften his story, but as it had already been told to the squire, he had {{concluded}} that there would be more danger in contradicting his first version than in sticking to it. Accordingly, he repeated his story almost word for word as he had told it to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The second pursed up his face, {{for there}} is an {{etiquette}} in these affairs at sea which the man, who had come there fresh from a sawmill, apparently did not understand. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robertson</b> bossed the putting in of that ring, and he knows his business. Anyway, if he tells you you will run her dry." ...|$|E
60|$|Intercourse {{with the}} Robertsons {{was the great}} {{refreshment}} in those anxious days. A grant from Government had been made for a Church Mission station upon the coast, and upon the river Umlazi, not many miles from Durban; and here <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> stationed themselves with their little company of orphans, refugees, and Kaffirs; also a Hottentot family, whose children they were bringing up.|$|R
5000|$|The Americana {{and folk}} art {{collection}} contains paintings, works on paper, sculpture, textile arts and furniture. It was in 1934 that Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> John Law <b>Robertson</b> lent significant pieces of American Folk Art for an {{exhibition at the}} Everhart Museum. Most of these collections were later acquired in the years 1946 to 1948 and these form {{the base of the}} extensive American Folk Art collection. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson</b> (whose actual full name has been difficult to determine, since she is always referenced publicly only as [...] "Mrs. John Law Robertson") {{was one of the first}} individuals who exclusively dedicated time and money to develop on one of the seminal collections of folk art in the country. Her enthusiasm for folk art is recorded in letters from the museum archives where she explicitly states her commitment to and passion for art that was frequently ignored by institutions exclusively dedicated to “fine arts.” <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Robertson,</b> an area native, balked at the conventional, conservative trends of the art world in favor of what she deemed of value. Like other early folk art collectors, she sought American art outside the established halls of the Academy, understanding the intrinsic beauty, the evident craftsmanship and the inherent history of these objects.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the mayor}} of the Queenstown borough from 1866 to 1869.

It was named the Brunswick Flour Mill as Robertson was from Brunswick (in modern day Canada) and Hallenstein was from Brunswick (in modern day Germany). On 19 February 1868 his wife gave birth to a son at Queenstown.|$|R
