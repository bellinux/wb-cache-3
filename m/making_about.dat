5|$|During World War I, Kurt Grotrian {{left the}} factory {{to serve in}} the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken {{prisoner}} of war. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917. Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and in orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000. In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky. The piano had three manuals, and strings tuned a quarter tone apart. By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was <b>making</b> <b>about</b> 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the Great Depression; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.|$|E
5|$|Never Let Me Go was {{released}} to four movie theaters in its opening {{weekend in the}} United States, with an additional one hundred-sixty-three theatres added to its theatrical run later on. The film became the number one-screening at these four theatres on its opening day, and grossed slightly over US$44,500 from those select screenings. In its opening weekend, the film made over US$111,700, averaging US$30,250 per theatre, taking 42nd place at the box office. In its succeeding week, revenues for Never Let Me Go saw an 117% increase, <b>making</b> <b>about</b> US$241,000, {{with an average of}} nearly US$9,500 per theatre.

After one month of release, it pulled in US$350,000, increasing nearly 90 percent from its previous weekend.|$|E

The union claimed that the proposed rule changes would cut workers salaries by 38 percent. The League offered different pay raises for different classes of workers, but the union argued these did not make up for the lost income.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, a {{much better}} paying job enticed Wood to leave West Texas {{for the first time}} as a head coach. He landed in Victoria, Texas where he reunited with Assistant Coach Morris Southall. That year, Wood also hired Kenneth West as an {{assistant}} coach. West had played for Wood at Stamford in 1951. The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was getting paid well in Victoria, <b>making</b> <b>about</b> $10,000, but a lack of fan support and homesickness for West Texas convinced him to move back west. He left Victoria with twelve wins, seven losses, and one tie.|$|E

Matsushima remained with Alice Japan for nearly four years <b>making</b> <b>about</b> one original video per month before releasing her retirement work Kaede Matsuhima's Official Retiring Performance - Smile, Last Message in November 2007.

500|$|There {{had been}} calls for reform long before 1832, but without success. The Act that finally succeeded was {{proposed}} by the Whigs, led by Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey. It met with significant opposition from the [...] factions in Parliament, who had long governed the country; opposition was especially pronounced in the House of Lords. Nevertheless, the bill was eventually passed, mainly {{as a result of}} public pressure. The Act granted seats in the House of Commons to large cities that had sprung up during the Industrial Revolution, and removed seats from the [...] "rotten boroughs": those with very small electorates and usually dominated by a wealthy patron. The Act also increased the electorate from about 500,000 to 800,000, <b>making</b> <b>about</b> one in five adult males allowed to vote,.|$|E
500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time.

It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were <b>making</b> <b>about</b> four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?"

500|$|Redding's {{breakthrough}} came in 1958 on {{disc jockey}} Hamp Swain's [...] "The Teenage Party," [...] a talent contest {{at the local}} Roxy and Douglass Theatres. Johnny Jenkins, a locally prominent guitarist, was in the audience and, finding Redding's backing band lacking in musical skills, offered to accompany him. Redding sang Little Richard's [...] "Heebie Jeebies." [...] The combination enabled Redding to win Swain's talent contest for fifteen consecutive weeks; the cash prize was $5. Jenkins later worked as lead guitarist and played with Redding during several later gigs. Redding was soon invited to replace Willie Jones as frontman of Pat T. Cake and the Mighty Panthers, featuring Johnny Jenkins. Redding was then hired by the Upsetters when Little Richard abandoned rock and roll in favor of gospel music. Redding was well paid, <b>making</b> <b>about</b> $25 per gig, but did not stay long.|$|E

He {{soon began to}} make a name for himself in films such as Brewster's Millions in 1935, Men Are Not Gods in 1936 and Farewell Again in 1937. He was <b>making</b> <b>about</b> £300 a week during this stage of his career, a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time. He brought what the Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "smooth villainy" [...] to the role of Frank Sutton in The Squeaker in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in The Spy in Black, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's first collaboration. Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy his [...] "great god of all screen actors"; he was so impressed by Tracy's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{had been}} {{approached}} at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who {{wanted him to}} star in a television drama he was <b>making</b> <b>about</b> the 1972 [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was [...] "no smoke without fire" [...] and that the Catholic marchers {{must have done something}} to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had [...] "an extraordinary effect" [...] on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, [...] "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear." [...] Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.|$|E
