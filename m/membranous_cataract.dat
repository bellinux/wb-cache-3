40|$|Objective. In a group case series, the {{clinical}} characteristics of congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> in children were studied {{to establish a}} system of classification and determine the surgical method suited for each type. Methods. Children (18 eyes) with congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> were examined by slit lamp, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and operating microscopy to classify cataracts. The clinical characteristics of congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> and its feature related to the surgical method were analyzed. Results. Five major types of congenital membranous cataracts were classified. All of the surgeries were successful. Anterior and posterior capsulorhexis was performed using Klöti RF capsulotomy tips. The capsular flap was removed, and anterior vitrectomy was performed using a vitrectomy cutter. Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification in 16. 7 % of the patients. Conclusion. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used successfully to classify congenital membranous cataracts prior to surgery. Anterior and posterior capsulorhexis was performed using Klöti RF capsulotomy tips, and capsulectomy was performed using a vitrectomy cutter. These were effective techniques and should be considered for congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> removal surgery.

40|$|A 15 -year-old boy {{underwent}} phacoemulsification for a <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> {{during which}} the presence of anterior persistent hyaloid artery and elongated ciliary processes were discovered. A posterior capsulorhexis was performed and the anterior part of the persistent hyaloid artery stalk was resected together with the posterior capsule. A foldable intraocular lens was implanted and the optic was captured in the posterior capsulorhexis margin. This is an unusual case of congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> associated with malformations of persistent fetal vasculature and elongated ciliary processes...|$|E
40|$|The Hallermann-Streiff {{syndrome}} {{is a complex}} association of developmental anomalies principally involving structures of ectodermal origin. The constant expressions of the syndrome are dyscephaly with mandibulo-facial malformation, bilateral congenital cataracts, and dental anomalies, while hypotrichosis, cutaneous atrophy, microphthalmos, and proportionate dwarfism are frequently present (Table I) (Ponte, I 962). Numerous inconstant ocular features have been described, including anti-mongoloid palpebral fissures, blue sclerae, keratoglobus, malformation of the drainage angles, peripheral anterior synechiae, iris atrophy, persistent pupillary membrane, posterior synechiae, <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract,</b> amorphous retrolenticular membrane, vitreous opacities, pale optic discs, colobomata at the optic nerve entrance, retinal folds, various atrophic chorio-retinal changes and glaucoma (Table II) (Ludwig and Korting, I 950; Fransois, I 958...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{cataract}} is a {{major cause}} of visual impairment and childhood blindness. The solubility and stability of crystallin proteins play critical roles in maintaining the optical transparency of the lens during the life span. Previous studies have shown that approximately 8. 3 %~ 25 % of congenital cataracts are inherited, and mutations in crystallins are the most common. In this study, we attempted to identify the genetic defect in a four-generation family affected with congenital cataracts. The congenital cataract phenotype of this four-generation family was identified as <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> by slit-lamp photography. Mutation screening of the candidate genes detected a heterozygous c. 465 G → C change in the exon 6 of the βB 2 -crystallin gene (CRYBB 2) in all family members affected with cataracts, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved Tryptophan to Cystine (p. W 151 C). The mutation was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and found that the transition resulted {{in the absence of a}} BslI restriction site in the affected members of the pedigree. The outcome of PolyPhen- 2 and SIFT analysis predicted that this W 151 C mutation would probably damage to the structure and function of βB 2 -crystallin. Wild type (wt) and W 151 C mutant βB 2 -crystallin were expressed in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs), and the fluorescence results showed that Wt-βB 2 -crystallin was evenly distributed throughout the cells, whereas approximately 34. 7 % of cells transfected with the W 151 C mutant βB 2 -crystallin formed intracellular aggregates. Taken together, these data suggest that the missense mutation in CRYBB 2 gene leads to progressive congenital <b>membranous</b> <b>cataract</b> by impacting the solubility and function of βB 2 -crystallin...|$|E
