5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario {{grew in the}} early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. A <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> faced by planners was {{the improvement of the}} routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|Lazio faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks {{on the state of}} the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor George Pataki, however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.|$|E
5|$|Rules of Engagement: A <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> for the contingents {{concerned}} Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Orders for Opening Fire (OFOF). In 1989 the UN had no {{doctrine in}} this area, and {{was unable to}} develop any during the mission. The Australian contingent used standard ROE prepared before the deployment.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol was a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but {{was careful to}} speak well of temperance advocates, {{many of whom were}} women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> in {{her initial}} {{election}} {{was whether the}} two candidates would vote to override President George W.

Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{settled the}} issue of Chinese immigration, passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. Arthur {{initially}} vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a later compromise bill, which banned immigration from China for ten years. Tariffs, a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> in the campaign, remained largely unchanged {{in the four years}} that followed, although Congress did pass a minor revision that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent. After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.|$|E
5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} <b>major</b> <b>issue.</b> Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E

The <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> was whether a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to make a more direct connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred.

5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E

McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression and the {{election}} of Democratic party candidates in 1932 ended widespread national support for Prohibition. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who included repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment as a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> of his presidential campaign in 1932, made good on his promise to American voters. On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide Prohibition. However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and prohibition of sales on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{utility of}} the remaining castles in Britain and Ireland continued to diminish. Some castles became regimental depots, including Carlisle Castle and Chester Castle. Carrickfergus Castle was re-equipped with gunports {{in order to provide}} coastal defences {{at the end of the}} Napoleonic period. Political instability was a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> during the early 19th century and the popularity of the Chartist movement led to proposals to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. In Ireland Dublin Castle played an increasing role in Ireland as Fenian pressures for independence grew during the century.|$|E
5|$|The new {{keyboard}} did {{not include}} the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a <b>major</b> <b>issue,</b> as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48K BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128K BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.|$|E

5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E
5|$|After {{rendering}} noncombat {{service in}} World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, {{becoming the first}} Republican county judge {{in the history of}} Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed the votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the {{reduction in the number of}} voters.|$|E
