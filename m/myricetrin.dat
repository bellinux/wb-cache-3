40|$|Crude {{extracts}} from over 16 {{species of plants}} from the family Convolvulaceae were evaluated for phytotoxic activity against Agrostis stolonifera (bentgrass) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) at 1000 microg/mL. Ethanol extracts of Dicranostyles ampla Ducke {{were among the most}} active of those species tested. Systematic bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract of the aerial parts from this species was performed to identify specifically the phytotoxic compounds. Two phytotoxic flavonoids, dihydromyricetin (1) and myricetin- 3 -O-alpha-rhamnoside or <b>myricetrin</b> (2), were found to be responsible for much of the activity of the extract as a whole in the A. stolonifera and L. sativa bioassay. In a Lemna paucicostata bioassay, 1 and 2 had no activity at 100 microM. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of effective antimicrobial agents also active on biofilms {{is a topic}} of crucial importance in food and industrial environment. For that purpose methanol extracts of Turkish plants, Ficus carica L., Juglans regia L., Olea europaea L., Punica granatum L. and Rhus coriaria L., were investigated. Among the extracts, P. granatum L. and R. coriaria L. showed the best antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 78 – 625  μg/ml for Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and 312 – 1250  μg/ml for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SubMICs produced a significant biofilm inhibition equal to 80 – 60 % for L. monocytogenes and 90 – 80 % for S. aureus. The extracts showed also the highest polyphenol content and the strongest antioxidant activity. Bioassay-guided and HPLC procedures demonstrated the presence of apigenin 4 ′-O-β-glucoside in P. granatum L. and <b>myricetrin</b> and quercitrin in R. coriaria L. Antigenotoxicity of plant extracts was also observed The present findings promote the value-adding of P. granatum L. and R. coriaria L. leaves as natural antimicrobial/antioxidant agents for control of food-related bacterial biofilms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Phytochemical {{investigation}} of polyphenolic contents of Podocarpus gracilior Pilger and Ruprechtia polystachya Griseb leaves were resulted in isolation and identification {{of three and}} six known polyphenolic compounds respectively. In addition of a new polyphenolic compound isolated {{for the first time}} from nature from R. polystachya which is identified as 4 `-O-Galloyl-myricetin- 3 -O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (4 `-O-galloyl <b>myricetrin).</b> Identification of hydrocarbons in P. gracilior and R. polystachya leaves resulted in identification of 19 and 21 compounds respectively. Concerning the composition of fatty acids content in P. gracilior it could be concluded that the unsaturated fatty acids (51. 16 %) represented higher percentage than that of saturated ones (38. 87 %). In the case of R. polystachya, the saturated fatty acids (70. 58 %) were dominated on the unsaturated ones (27. 30 %). The tested methanol extracts of P. gracilior and R. polystachya leaves showed antioxidant, antimicrobial and stimulatory activities to nitric oxide release from macrophage cell line. Methanol extracts of P. gracilior leaves had weak cytotoxic effect against MCF- 7 cells (breast adenocarcinoma cell line) while methanol extracts of R. polystachya leaves did not show cytotoxic activity...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the chemical study and evaluation of the phytotoxic effects of the methanol extract of E. flavescens leaves. The compounds were isolated using classic chromatographic techniques and {{the identification of the}} phenolic profile was proposed from the HPLC/DAD/MS-MS data. Structure elucidation of the compounds was performed by 1 H and 13 C (1 D e 2 D) NMR techniques and HRMS. The chemical study led to the isolation of betulinic acid (1) and lupeol (2), identified in mixture quercitrin (3) and catechin (4) beyond <b>myricetrin</b> (5) in mixture with (3). In addition, several phenolic compounds were identified, among them, flavonoids and phenolic acids. For bioassays phytotoxic effect were used as test plants two invasive species, M. pudica and S. obtusifolia. The methanol extract showed significant seed germination inhibition. The triterpenoid 1 showed low inhibition effects on seed germination and moderate effects on radicle and hypocotyl growth. The mixture of flavonoids 3 / 4 showed effective phytotoxic effects, inhibiting 92, 1 % of the seed germination of M. pudica and 63, 0 % of S. obtusifolia. Inhibitions of 72, 5 % and 76, 1 % of M. pudica radicle and hypocotyl growths were observed, respectively, and 74, 5 % and 78, 0 % of S. obtusifolia for the same bioassays, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{methanolic}} extract of {{the leaves}} of Liquidambar styraciflua L. (Altingiaceae) (LSE) was evaluated for hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities in carbon tetrachloride liver-damaged rats. Hepatotoxicity was induced via intraperitoneal injection of CCl 4 1 : 9 in olive oil, at a dose of 0. 5 ml/kg b. wt. The animals received the extract, orally, at two dose levels (250 and 500 mg/kg b. wt.) The administration regimen was twice a week, for six consecutive weeks. LSE exhibited a significant dose-dependent protective effect by lowering the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and ameliorating the level of serum protein. In addition, LSE showed antioxidant activity through improving the levels of blood glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, vitamin E and hepatic total protein contents. The LSE revealed activity approached that of silymarin, a known hepatoprotective agent. These biochemical observations were supported by examination of the histopathological features of the liver. Chromatographic fractionation of LSE afforded seven phenolic compounds. These were identified {{on the basis of}} chromatographic, chemical and spectroscopic analyses as: gallic acid (1), isorugosin B (2), casuarictin (3), quercetin- 3 -O-β-d- 4 C 1 -glucopyranoside (4), myricetin- 3 -O-α-l- 1 C 4 -rhamnopyranoside (<b>myricetrin)</b> (5), quercetin (6) and myricetin (7). The isolated phenolics probably account for the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects exhibited by the parent extract. Furthermore, a validated RP-HPLC method was devised for standardization of LSE, in view to fulfill the requirements of efficient research methodology for evaluation of bioactive herbal drugs. The above findings suggested that LSE could be considered as a standardized herbal product with antifibrotic, hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential...|$|E
40|$|Croton {{species are}} used in folk {{medicine}} {{in the management of}} infections, inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases. In order to isolate, characterize and evaluate the bioactive constituents of Croton menyharthii Pax leaf extracts, repeated column fractionation of the ethyl acetate fraction from a 20 % aqueous methanol crude extract afforded three flavonols identified by NMR (1 D and 2 D) spectroscopic methods as myricetrin- 3 -O-rhamnoside (<b>myricetrin,</b> 1), quercetin- 3 -O-rhamnoside (2) and quercetin (3) along with an indole alkaloid, (E) -N-(4 -hydroxycinnamoyl) - 5 -hydroxytryptamine, [trans-N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin, 4]. All the compounds are reported from the leaf extract of this plant for the first time. The crude extracts, four solvent fractions (hexane, DCM, ethyl acetate and butanol) and isolated compounds obtained from the leaves were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on selected bacteria, a fungus (Candida albicans), cyclooxygenase (COX- 2), α-glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Amongst the compounds, quercetin (3) was the most active against Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans while myricetrin- 3 -O-rhamnoside (1) and trans-N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin (4) were the most active compounds against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibitory activity of myricetrin- 3 -O-rhamnoside (1) against COX- 2 was insignificant while that of the other three compounds 2 – 4 was low. The AChE inhibitory activity of the alkaloid, trans-N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin was high, with a percentage inhibitory activity of 72. 6 % and an IC 50 value of 15. 0 µg/mL. The rest of the compounds only had moderate activity. Croton menyharthii leaf extracts and isolated compounds inhibit α-glucosidase at very low IC 50 values compared to the synthetic drug acarbose. Structure activity relationship of the isolated flavonols 1 – 3 is briefly outlined. Compounds 1 – 4 and the leaf extracts exhibited a broad spectrum of activities. This validates the ethnomedicinal use of the plant in folk medicine...|$|E
