2500|$|From the {{inception}} of the name, the Chamber stated that it would not limit the label of Tech Valley to just the Capital District; rather, Tech Valley was envisioned as running from IBM's Westchester County plants and headquarters north to Saratoga Springs and west up the Mohawk Valley. Early businesses that used the Tech Valley name helped spread the word, businesses such as Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) who used the phrase in its job recruitment material, MapInfo Corporation, Tech Valley Communications, Tech Valley Office Interiors, and [...] The first use of the phrase by a business may have been the accounting firm Urbach, Kahn, & Werlin in 1998, which put the Tech Valley name and logo on its postage meter, shortly before that the Chamber had begun instituting a new telephone greeting, [...] "Albany-Colonie Chamber. Tech Valley. <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>help</b> you".|$|E
2500|$|In Somerset West of South Africa, the Kwan Um School of Zen {{once had}} the largest {{following}} of Zen practitioners in the area with their former Dharma Centre, a place that today today acts independent of the Kwan Um organization. Founded in 1982 by Heila Downey, {{a former student of}} Philip Kapleau, the center had for many years acted as an informal affiliate of the Rochester Zen Center in Rochester, New York. In 1989 Dharma Centre began embracing the practices of the Kwan um School of Zen. Heila Downey herself was made a Ji Do Poep Sa Nim, granting her inka, authority to teach within the School. According to Michel Clasquin in the book Westward Dharma: Buddhism Beyond Asia, [...] "There are other Zen groups in South Africa, notably in Johannesburg, but the Dharma Centre, now headquartered in the town of Robertson, is clearly the leading Zen-based organization. The institutional support it receives from the Kwan Um organization means that it is able to import teachers with relative ease. However, {{it should be noted that}} in a suburban satellite center in Cape Town, the Dharma Centre has been forced by popular demand to reinstitute a weekly meditation session shorn of all ritual, much as things were before 1989." [...] According to the Dharma Centre's own website, [...] "With changing times, our practice and teaching has evolved to express a style in harmony with our African heritage resulting in our resignation from the Kwan Um School of Zen." [...] Regardless of this resignation, the center does demonstrate a continuing respect for the teachings of Seungsahn by stating, [...] "As the African Dharma continues to develop and grow, Zen Master Seung Sahn's legacy and teaching will continue to sustain and encourage us in the never-ending quest of 'Who am I' and 'How <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>Help</b> You?'" ...|$|E
