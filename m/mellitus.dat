5|$|<b>Mellitus</b> fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so <b>Mellitus,</b> accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. <b>Mellitus</b> was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but {{it may have been}} longer. However, <b>Mellitus</b> did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although <b>Mellitus</b> fled, there {{does not seem to have}} been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E
5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and <b>Mellitus</b> {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. <b>Mellitus</b> also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, <b>Mellitus</b> became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did <b>Mellitus,</b> although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of encouragement to the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Exactly when <b>Mellitus</b> and {{his party}} arrived in England is unknown, but he was {{certainly}} in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as bishop {{in the province of}} the East Saxons, making <b>Mellitus</b> the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons' capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission's efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, <b>Mellitus</b> baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht's nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter that claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to <b>Mellitus</b> is a later forgery.|$|E
5|$|In 610 Laurence {{received}} {{letters from}} Pope Boniface IV, addressed {{to him as}} archbishop and Augustine's successor. The correspondence {{was in response to}} Laurence having sent <b>Mellitus</b> to Rome earlier in 610, to solicit advice from the papacy on matters concerning the English Church. While in Rome <b>Mellitus</b> attended a synod, and brought the synodical decrees back with him to Laurence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mellitus</b> was exiled from London by {{the pagan}} successors to his patron, King Sæberht of Essex, {{following}} the latter's death around 616. King Æthelberht of Kent, Mellitus' other patron, died {{at about the}} same time, forcing him to take refuge in Gaul. <b>Mellitus</b> returned to England the following year, after Æthelberht's successor had been converted to Christianity, but he was unable to return to London, whose inhabitants remained pagan. <b>Mellitus</b> was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 619. During his tenure, he was alleged to have miraculously saved the cathedral, and much of the town of Canterbury, from a fire. After his death in 624, <b>Mellitus</b> was revered as a saint.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham sees {{political factors}} {{at work in}} the expulsion of <b>Mellitus,</b> as it was Sæberht's sons who banished <b>Mellitus.</b> Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force <b>Mellitus</b> to give them the Eucharist without ever becoming Christians, seeing the Eucharist as magical. Although Bede does not give details of any political factors surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling <b>Mellitus</b> the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Early 624?: Justus {{converts}} Eadbald. Messengers go to Rome. Also {{at about}} this time Æthelburg's marriage to Edwin is arranged, perhaps before the conversion. Eadbald builds a church, and <b>Mellitus</b> consecrates it.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and asthma. As a result, obesity {{has been found to}} reduce life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mellitus</b> (died 24 April 624) was {{the first}} Bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity. He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604. <b>Mellitus</b> was the {{recipient}} of a famous letter from Pope Gregory I known as the Epistola ad Mellitum, preserved in a later work by the medieval chronicler Bede, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. In 610, <b>Mellitus</b> returned to Italy to attend a council of bishops, and returned to England bearing papal letters to some of the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mellitus</b> {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had <b>Mellitus</b> take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, <b>Mellitus</b> joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica {{has long}} been a rare disease. Today, it appears in only 2% of {{individuals}} diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, which accounts for 90% of instances of the disease. Primary hyperparathyroidism is three times as common in individuals with diabetes <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{disease states}} can also {{increase}} the risk of developing tuberculosis. These include alcoholism and diabetes <b>mellitus</b> (three-fold increase).|$|E
5|$|The use of Borjomi {{water has}} been {{suggested}} by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several digestive diseases and diabetes <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} the missionaries were {{considered}} saints, including Augustine, who became another cult figure; the monastery he founded in Canterbury was eventually rededicated to him. Honorius, James the Deacon, Justus, Lawrence, <b>Mellitus,</b> Paulinus, and Peter, were also considered saints, along with Æthelberht, of whom Bede said that he continued to protect his people even after death.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated <b>Mellitus</b> as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes <b>mellitus,</b> muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Diabetes <b>mellitus</b> is a {{risk factor}} for {{pancreatic}} cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who have been diagnosed with Type2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of diabetes <b>mellitus.</b> Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases {{people may not}} realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, O'Hara's family {{contacted}} {{social workers}} regarding claims that O'Hara, who had short-term memory loss, {{was a victim}} of elder abuse. In September 2012, O'Hara flew to the US after receiving doctor's permission to fly, and moved in with her grandson in Idaho. In her last years she suffered from diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 2 and short-term memory loss.|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|Laurence died on 2February 619, and {{was buried}} in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his relics, or remains, were moved, or translated, to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091. His shrine was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, {{flanking}} the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the feast day of 3February. The ninth century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with <b>Mellitus</b> and Justus. A Vita (or Life) was written about the time of his translation, by Goscelin, but it is mainly based on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death. He was succeeded as archbishop by <b>Mellitus,</b> the Bishop of London.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mellitus</b> died on 24 April 624, and {{was buried}} at St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury that same day. He became revered as a saint after his death, and was allotted the feast day of24 April. In the ninth century, Mellitus' feast day was {{mentioned}} in the Stowe Missal, along with Laurence and Justus. He was still venerated at St Augustine's in 1120, along {{with a number of}} other local saints. There was also a shrine to him at Old St Paul's Cathedral in London. Shortly after the Norman Conquest, Goscelin wrote a life of <b>Mellitus,</b> the first of several to appear around that time, but none contain any information not included in Bede's earlier works. These later medieval lives do, however, reveal that during Goscelin's lifetime persons suffering from gout were urged to pray at Mellitus' tomb. Goscelin records that Mellitus' shrine flanked that of Augustine, along with Laurence, in the eastern central chapel of the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes <b>mellitus.</b> Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|Paulinus was a monk from Rome {{sent to the}} Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, {{along with}} <b>Mellitus</b> and others, {{as part of the}} second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He was {{probably}} an Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further activities until he went to Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{returned}} to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of atheism. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined {{to be caused by}} diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and nearly died. She was later diagnosed with Diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 1, and is now insulin-dependent. In 2003, following the recommendation of her husband and shortly after his death, Rice underwent gastric bypass surgery and shed 103 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, {{diabetes}} <b>mellitus,</b> breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes <b>mellitus,</b> especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes <b>mellitus.</b> The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|Together with <b>Mellitus,</b> the Bishop of London, Justus {{signed a}} letter written by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops urging the native church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also {{mentioned}} the fact that Irish missionaries, such as Dagan, had refused to share meals with the missionaries. Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.|$|E
5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for <b>Mellitus</b> to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes <b>mellitus.</b> The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 616, {{the year}} of the Battle of the River Idle, Æthelberht of Kent died and was succeeded by his pagan son Eadbald. After the death of the Christian Saebert of Essex, his three sons shared the kingdom, {{returning}} it to pagan rule, and drove out the Gregorian missionaries led by <b>Mellitus.</b> The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back into the fold. During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to Rædwald. By the time of his death, the mission in Kent had been fully re-established.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate that it {{may be a}} possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes <b>mellitus</b> type 2 have also been shown to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes <b>mellitus</b> and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
