5|$|Among {{the main}} common {{threats to the}} park are glacier retreat due to global warming; {{hydropower}} projects; legal and illegal <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights to the land by the locals).|$|E
5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{historical}} {{account of}} the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor calcinable. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal. In 1758, {{he was sent to}} superintend mercury <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> in Huancavelica.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} in the late 1960s used herbicides to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b> Large areas of rainforest were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.|$|E
5|$|The suburb is {{at a high}} {{elevation}} in the Mount Lofty Ranges, {{and provides}} views over Adelaide as well as containing a renowned golf course and country club. <b>Mining</b> <b>operations</b> in the 19th century gave the area notoriety, but it has since developed slowly into a small, quiet and secluded suburb.|$|E
5|$|The von Neumann neighborhood, {{in which}} each cell in a {{two-dimensional}} grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues {{to be used for}} other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.|$|E

5|$|Christian IV {{undertook}} {{a number of}} projects in Norway that were largely based on Renaissance architecture He established <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> in Kongsberg and Røros, now a World Heritage Site. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was {{moved to a new}} location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed Christiania. King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand, naming it after himself.|$|E
5|$|The Beaver Mill Lumber Company {{became one}} of the largest single lumber {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber boomtowns, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam, and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, and even a ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in <b>mining</b> <b>operations,</b> construction, and railroads.|$|E
5|$|The mining washed {{hundreds}} of thousands of tons of earth and sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries, devastated the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> had ended, and it was closed in 1918. Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Twenty-six percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed contains this soil series. Much soil and bedrock in this series has been removed during <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b> This soil series occurs {{in the southern part}} of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, near tributaries such as Black Creek and Stony Creek. The soils in this soil series are highly permeable.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small <b>mining</b> <b>operations,</b> mostly in the US.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, oil and <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> in {{threatened}} regions were temporarily shut down. Already {{suffering from}} the impacts of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, residents were warned about the likelihood of flooding due to the already saturated grounds. The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings {{for most of the}} Pilbara coastline on 28 February. The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and ensure that all cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one. Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

50|$|Northern Nevada has {{a limited}} supply of surface water which is {{considered}} a precious commodity, however large amounts of water can be found underground. At the Pipeline, pit water is pumped from aquifers where it is pumped to ranch land to be reintroduced into the groundwater supply. The mine keeps two streams of water, a contact water stream in which the water has {{come into contact with}} the <b>mining</b> <b>operation,</b> and a non-contact water stream where the water has not come into contact with the <b>mining</b> <b>operation.</b> The 'contact water stream is recycled and reused in the <b>mining</b> <b>operation</b> where the noncontact water is pumped off site.|$|R
5|$|In 1916, <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> in Silver Reef resumed {{under the}} {{direction}} of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting and Refining Company in 1928, but the company did minimal work {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979. Today, the Wells Fargo office, the Cosmopolitan Restaurant, the Rice Building, and numerous foundations and walls remain in the town site, and a few dozen homes have been constructed in the area.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|Rory Swann is {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of the Hyperion. Swann came {{from a family of}} tech-savvy miners who opened a successful private mining operation on Meinhoff: however, their operation was crushed by ever-rising taxes. Swann lodged a complaint to the Kel-Morian Combine officials and discovered that Tavish Kerr, who's <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> weren't burden with taxes, bribed officials to put rival claims out of business through excessive taxation. Swann started a miner's revolt, claiming independence from the Kel-Morian Combine. However, Combine forces arrived and mercilessly crushed the revolt. Swann himself lost an arm, along with many friends, and was only saved because Raynor's Raiders responded to their distress signal. Swann had nothing left, so he joined the Raiders.|$|E

Machynys is a championship golf course opened in 2005 and built as part of the Llanelli Waterside regeneration plan. Pembrey Circuit is a motor racing circuit near Pembrey village, considered the home of Welsh motorsport, providing racing for cars, motorcycles, karts and trucks. It was opened in 1989 on a former airfield, is popular for testing and has hosted many events including the British Touring Car Championship twice.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it {{in a constant state of}} instability. Coal <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian kings, who wielded {{absolute}} power and commanded state {{resources such as}} gold and silver, facilitated <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.|$|E
