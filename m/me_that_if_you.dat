500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man once told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have to have an origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
6000|$|She looked, however, as if {{she caught}} me in a {{weakness}} here. [...] "Then {{why did you say}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should reconsider----" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Ralph taught <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> treat {{players like}} human beings, they will play like Superman", he told Bill Plaschke in the biography, I Live for This: Baseball's Last True Believer. [...] "He {{taught me how}} a pat on a {{shoulder}} {{can be just as}} important as a kick in the butt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. Isaac and Jacob {{are good}} enough for yours truly. Pass <b>me</b> <b>that</b> rattle, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. I can't chew India-rubber rings all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That means I {{will only}} marry {{the man who}} gives <b>me</b> <b>that</b> necklace. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> fear the deed, perhaps there are some others by whom it might be tried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Betsy doubtfully, [...] "it strikes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever {{manage to}} get there the Metal Monarch will make you, too, his prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but he, he was {{different}} from the others you had met. His reputation stood high. My uncle accounted him invincible; he persuaded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> met nothing could save you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? What's {{the matter}} with you? You're an {{excellent}} chap, sound in wind and limb, and didn't you once tell <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> married, you came into a pretty sizeable bit of money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] said Mr. Hills, {{dropping}} {{into a chair}} by the counter and caressing his moustache. [...] "But you wouldn't speak to <b>me</b> like <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> knew what a terrible day I've had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you were}} {{thinking}} of me, anyhow. I am glad of it. Do you know, it seems to <b>me,</b> somehow, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to stop thinking of me I shouldn't be {{in the world at}} all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The nurse {{showed no}} outward signs of exultation. She waited {{a little to}} get the {{announcement}} of the legacy well settled in her mind--and then she said quietly, 'Master Henry, who gives <b>me</b> <b>that</b> money, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook, {{in her own}} {{manner and}} with a slow headshake, looked lovely. [...] "I couldn't." [...] Then she puzzled {{it out with a}} pause. [...] "It even does come over <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} settled,--or any {{beginning}} {{of anything that}} ever can be settled, But I am not talking about myself. He has told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will accept him, he will do anything that you and I may ask him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Phoebe meditated a few moments; then looking up, said, 'I {{beg your}} pardon, Robin, {{but it does}} strike <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think {{that this kind of}} life is not good for Lucilla, it cannot be right to {{sacrifice}} your own higher prospects to enable her to continue it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Rather a good scheme {{occurred}} to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven't thought over {{the idea of}} that trip on my yacht and decided it would bore you to death. You still feel like making one of the party--what?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there are}} two Allan Armadales--two Allan Armadales--two Allan Armadales. There! three is a lucky number. Haunt <b>me</b> again, after <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said he, 'and she bade <b>me</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't {{meet her}} {{at nine o'clock}} to-morrow you will never see her again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've seen it done," [...] said Dan, [...] "but I {{never knew}} how it was managed. I {{always thought it was}} going to blow up; but it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were good and true and very meek, and had a {{conscience}} void of offence, it wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jordan {{flashed a}} warning glance at Jimmy. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will wait the week, {{you are going}} to get your freight. I can't tell you exactly why, but I wouldn't break out my anchor for another eight days if I were you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You know me,' I said. 'I am your Bimbashi. I {{am going}} to try and get through their lines; but if it is known how I have escaped, I shall be pursued and slain. Will you swear to <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are questioned, you will say you know nothing of my flight?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, we {{had heard}} before, and that's where our mystery of the sealed door, upon which you {{stumbled}} to-night, has its origin. Pass <b>me</b> <b>that</b> desk, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. Here I have my father's letters, {{and you are the}} first man except Mr. Perceval who has seen them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be so cocky," [...] cried Pym, {{in sudden}} rebellion. [...] "You are only my {{amanuensis}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can tell <b>me</b> what <b>that</b> is. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't--out you go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the {{greatest}} thing, Cynthy," [...] he said, breathlessly, [...] "to {{have you with}} <b>me</b> in <b>that.</b> But, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> said I ought to study law, I should do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I, too, {{should like}} to know {{something}} about it," [...] Aemilia said. [...] "By the way Ennia spoke, when she said you knew that she was a Christian, it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did know, which I thought was impossible, she thought you were angry with her for becoming a Christian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son, {{whatever}} his faults may be, {{has all the}} instincts of a gentleman," [...] Lady Silchester answered proudly; [...] "and if he liked you for yourself, it would make no difference, {{even if you were}} a tradesman's son. Promise <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the opportunity, you will do what you can?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "W'y, Willum, {{it seems}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go on improvin' things at this rate there won't be no use {{in a short time}} for 'uman 'ands at all. We'll just 'ave to sit still an' let {{machinery}} do our work for us, an' all the trades-people will be throwd out of employment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the {{advantage}} {{it will be}} to <b>me</b> now is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a cigar in your mouth I shan't get quite so much of your chatty conversation. Take one, for my sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look me {{straight}} in the face, Mr. Lynx, and tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I give <b>you</b> a handsome new tail, you will never boast about it or take undue pride in it,' said she.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But mind,' {{she said}} threateningly, 'no harm {{is to come}} to it. I don't know what your game is, but <b>you</b> promised <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> break your word I will peach, as true as my name is Polly Green. I don't care {{what they do to}} me, but I will split on you and tell the whole business.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am much gratified in so perceiving, and {{in having}} such {{evidence}} that my advice {{has not been}} indiscreet. It occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> received the first intimation of these circumstances from other sources, you would be bound on your own behalf to employ an agent to look after your own interests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How it {{is about}} your being sorry. Your father told <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were truly {{penitent}} for what happened about those boys, I should find you, when I came {{to talk with you}} about it, grieved for your own fault, and if you were not penitent, you would only be angry at theirs. I see which it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know you}} was here, Mr Young, else I wouldn't have {{disturbed}} you," [...] said Adams. [...] "I just {{came up to}} see if I could find the book, for it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> agree to carry out your notion of turnin' schoolmaster, {{it would be as}} well to have the school-book down beside us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Did’ee {{ever see}} a British ship, Master Kirby? an English line-of- battle ship, boy? Where did’ee ever fall {{in with a}} regular built vessel, with starn-post and cutwater, gar board-streak and plank- shear, gangways, and hatchways, and waterways, quarter-deck, and forecastle, ay, and flush-deck?—tell <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> man, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can; where away did’ee ever fall in with a full-rigged, regular-built, necked vessel?” ...|$|R
6000|$|Adam's eyes twinkled. [...] "If you go home, {{you may get}} her, and I allow she's {{probably}} {{worth the}} effort, but you're not going to side-track <b>me</b> like <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> quit now, I can buy you out and you'll have something {{to help you make}} another start; afterwards I mayn't be able. You needn't hesitate about taking the money; I guess you've earned it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Never again, George; never again," [...] {{said the}} dying woman. [...] "Let them lay {{me by my}} poor boy now, but promise <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> leave this dreadful place, and should grow rich, you will have us removed to some quiet country churchyard, a long, long way off--very far from here--where we can rest in peace. Dear George, promise me you will." ...|$|R
