40|$|Tools {{to access}} useful {{information}} is a growth area. Coping with the results, avoiding information overload, is another central concern. One {{way to address}} this is with <b>multiple</b> <b>monitors,</b> two or more displays on a single computer. Most operating systems now support the dragging of windows and objects across <b>multiple</b> <b>monitors.</b> In this field study of people in different occupations who use <b>multiple</b> <b>monitors,</b> I find that people do not use a second monitor as extra workspace, they {{use it in a}} variety of ways: secondary activities related to their principal tasks, for peripheral awareness of information that is not their main focus, and for easy access to resources. I also find that systems and applications do not make intelligent use of multiple monitors: The way we work online could be improved substantially at relatively low cost.

50|$|The biggest {{manufacturers}} of graphics card or on-board graphics products support <b>multiple</b> <b>monitor</b> configurations. This includes Nvidia, AMD, Matrox and Intel.

50|$|Support for a multi-monitor {{setup is}} either {{achieved}} by installing multiple graphics cards into one computer or by special display controllers, {{that have the}} ability to feed <b>multiple</b> <b>monitors</b> independently with a signal. Monitors supporting DisplayPort allow to drive <b>multiple</b> <b>monitors</b> from only one external clock. DisplayPort version 1.2 supports Multi-Stream Transport; this makes it possible to drive multiple displays on one single DisplayPort connector using a multi-head cable or loop through.|$|R

50|$|For a long time, editing xorg.conf was {{necessary}} for advanced input devices and <b>multiple</b> <b>monitor</b> output to work correctly. In modern systems this is seldom necessary due to input hotplugging and the XRandR extension integrated into new X.org releases.

50|$|The Matrox G200 {{graphics}} processor {{had been a}} successful product, competing with the various 2D & 3D combination cards available in 1998. Matrox took the technology developed from the G200 project, refined it, and basically doubled it up to form the G400 processor. The new chip featured several new and innovative additions, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>monitor</b> output support, an all-around 32-bit rendering pipeline with high performance, further improved 2D and video acceleration, and a new 3D feature known as Environment Mapped Bump Mapping.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{eliminating}} feedback in the monitor is called ringing out the monitors. To eliminate feedback, the monitor's level is increased until {{it starts to}} feed back. The feedback frequency is identified either by ear or by a frequency analyzer. Equalization is used to reduce that frequency. The monitor level is again increased until the next frequency starts to feed back and that frequency is eliminated. Normally, eliminating the first four or five feedback frequencies {{is all that is}} needed. If <b>multiple</b> <b>monitor</b> mixes are being used, the process has to be repeated for each separate monitor mix.|$|E
50|$|Windows 98, in general, {{provides}} improved—and {{a broader}} range of—support for IDE and SCSI drives and drive controllers, floppy drive controllers and all other classes of hardware than Windows 95. There is integrated Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) support (although the USB Supplement to Windows 95 OSR2 and later releases of Windows 95 did have AGP support). Windows 98 has built-in DVD support and UDF 1.02 read support. The Still imaging architecture (STI) with TWAIN support was introduced for scanners and cameras and Image Color Management 2.0 for devices to perform color space transformations. <b>Multiple</b> <b>monitor</b> support allows using up to 8 multiple monitors and/or multiple graphics adapters on a single PC. Windows 98 shipped with DirectX 5.2 which notably included DirectShow. Windows 98 Second Edition shipped with DirectX 6.1.|$|E
