40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of small yet {{powerful}} <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> have appeared on the market. Endowed with large disk capacity and network hardware, such systems are capable of holding large amounts of data, as well as of exchanging information with other hosts on a distributed system. These features suggest the need for the design and implementation of a distributed database system for <b>mobile</b> <b>computers.</b> Such <b>mobile</b> database systems present a host of technical challenges. One of them is dealing with the limited battery capacity of current mobile machines. We investigate the possibility of increasing the effective battery life of these computers by selecting energy-efficient query plans during query optimization. In this paper we review the capabilities of <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> and describe the power management issues in such systems. We examine the case of database systems on stand-alone <b>mobile</b> <b>computers,</b> and conclude that only a small modification is needed in standard query optimizers. However, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} mobile access to large {{databases}} leads to problems with <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> connectivity. <b>Mobile</b> <b>computers</b> often suffer from limited connectivity {{or lack of}} network access. Existing replicated databases are not well suited for mobile scenarios as well as algorithms used for data replication. Distributed database systems and distributed database management systems have been developed in response to trend of distributed computation. In distributed models of computations several sites are interconnected via a communications network. The advantages of data distribution involve increased availability, distributed access to data and improved performance of parallel processing. Disadvantages, on the other hand, are given by increased overhead and complexity in the system design and implementation.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in mobile computing is growing and many issues related to it are aim of research. In this paper, we propose a system that provides <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> with new data services, such as renting data lockers, Internet a la carte, etc. The basic idea behind the system is to combine {{the use of the}} indirect model and the mobile agent technology. According to the indirect model our system incorporates several functions and services in an intermediary element that relieves the <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> from many tasks and increases their capabilities. Mobile agent technology may reduce the workload in the <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> by de ning agents that represent them and that can be executed inthe intermediary element and in other places. We present in this paper an overview of the functional and operational features of the system...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{agents are}} {{programs}} that can move through a network {{under their own}} control, migrating from host to host and interacting with other agents and resources on each. We argue that these mobile, autonomous agents {{have the potential to}} provide a convenient, e cient and robust programming paradigm for distributed applications, particularly when partially connected computers are involved. Partially connected <b>computers</b> include <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> such as laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connected home computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of our mobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the speci c features that support <b>mobile</b> <b>computers</b> and disconnected operation. These features include network-sensing tools and a docking system that allows an agent to transparently move between <b>mobile</b> <b>computers,</b> regardless of when the computers connect to the network. ...|$|R
