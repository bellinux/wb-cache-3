40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{horizontal}} <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in an already concentrated industry.

At the time of the notification submission the participants do not know whether the Commission is strong or weak, and they can complain to the Court if the Commission prohibits the merger. We model the strategic interaction between Participants and Commission in a dynamic game of incomplete information and determine weak perfect Bayesian equilibria. The main finding of our paper is that Participants will base their decision to submit notification on their belief in a weak Commission decision and will almost completely ignore the possibility of a strong Commission decision. We also provide a detailed examination of one case from Serbian regulatory practice, which coincides with the results of our game theoretical model...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis titled " Accounting and tax aspects of capital {{transactions}} with company {{in comparison with}} CZ GAAP and IFRS" was the definition of ownership transactions with the company and description of some differences between both legislation. The accounting and taxation aspects were first analyzed in terms of theory (regu-lations, definition, history of the business combination and their development from the past to the present, present situation of volume of M&A transactions and method of accounting solutions of these transaction) and subsequently {{in the form of}} practical application to particular accounting data of two companies named XYZ a KLM. The practical part mostly deals with <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> KLM and XYZ. Both of them were limited liability compa-nies with financial problems. The first part of practical part of this thesis was to analyse the transformation project and progress chart. Then the closing balance sheets and income statements (Czech legislations) of XYZ and KLM were compared with balance sheets and statements according to IFRS. The opening balance sheet of the successor of this transaction (XYZ) was compiled by the purchase method with quantifying valuation difference on acquired assets. Mergers and acquisitions are the most frequent business combinations. Sectors of the economy with the highest number of these transactions are the sectors of industrials & chemicals {{in the world and the}} sector of Real estate in Czech Republic. The last chapter is focused on the differences and form IFRS and Czech legislation...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is to clarify the role of {{transaction}} cost for existence of an economic agent. It is demonstrated that the opposition of transaction cost and transformation cost is not rigid and there are costs that contain both transaction and transformation component. In addition the amount of transaction cost depends on parameters of company’s activity. This {{is why it is}} hardly possible to find the precise minimum of transaction cost and the model of organization of transactions within firm will be flexible. The firm’s structure contains special transaction divisions (centers of transaction cost) that are necessary for existence of the firm as a mechanism of organization of transactions (opposed to market). The status of these divisions depends on firm’s size. Transaction divisions can also exist outside the firm. They will minimize transaction costs of other economic agents on the basis of external effect of scale. External transaction divisions can exist both as collective structures (coordinating centers of strategic alliances) as well as independent ones (franchisors). A comparative analysis of transaction divisions and centers of cost was done. It was demonstrated that these elements of the firm have different economic and organizational structure. The notion of cost of external profitability was introduced. This notion can be used to analyze reasons for <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> or for their existence as independent structures. It is demonstrated that one of the functions of the firm is to use resources that cannot be used within independent production units...|$|E

40|$|Two or more {{companies}} may decide that their businesses should be combined {{for a number}} of reasons. This may, for example, be done in order for the companies to have access to new markets, to increase their market share, to increase their profitability by reducing the inefficiencies involved in the running of two or {{more companies}} in the same business area or to acquire technology, infrastructure, expertise and/or skill in new practice areas. Before the advent of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 South African law did not make provision for 'mergers' as that term is understood in many other jurisdictions. South African law did not recognise any mechanism by which one entity could be combined with another in terms of a statutory process, also referred to as a 'consolidation' in certain jurisdictions. One of the most significant changes proposed for the Companies Act was to make provision for a legal process by which companies could be combined. The concept of the amalgamation or <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> was accordingly introduced into our law, so as to enhance the efficiency of business combinations and to promote flexibility in this regard. It is significant that the statutory process of amalgamating or merging companies was adopted in addition to the existing forms of business combinations and/or acquisitions, such as the sale of a business as a going concern, the common law scheme of arrangement and offers to acquire the shares and/or other securities in a company. Companies therefore now have at their disposal an additional mechanism by which to engage in business combinations and/or acquisitions, and are required to consider in each proposed transaction the relevant circumstances to determine which mechanism will be most effective in giving effect to that transaction. This is in line with the move in the Companies Act towards self-regulation and the object of the Companies Act to encourage entrepreneurship. The main purpose of this work is to compare the requirements for, manner of implementation and consequences of an amalgamation or merger as contemplated in the Companies Act, referred to herein as a 'statutory merger', with that of the common law sale of a business...|$|E
40|$|Zaradi globalizacije so prevzemi postali del vsakdanje poslovne prakse. Večina teorij predvideva pozitivne učinke, saj se poveča učinkovitost poslovanja podjetja, doseže sinergija v ekonomiji obsega, kar je posledica novih kombinacij prej ločenih podjetij ali zmanjševanja stroškov. Prevzemno podjetje pridobi določen delež lastninskih pravic (delež delnic) v prevzetem podjetju, kar mu zagotavlja kontrolni delež za odločilno vplivanje na poslovanje prevzetega podjetja. Katerokoli obliko prevzema je mogoče opraviti s plačili v denarju, z zadolžitvijo podjetja, z zamenjavo za delnice ali druge vrednostne papirje. O združitvi podjetij govorimo, kadar iz dveh ali več podjetij nastane eno samo. Izvedena mora biti v skladu z obstoječo zakonodajo. Znotraj združitev ločimo spojitve in pripojitve. Po uspešno opravljenem prevzemu po navadi pride tudi do združitve podjetij. Prevzemi in združitve vselej prinašajo spremembe in drugačne pristope k opravljanju nalog in doseganju skupnih ciljev. Prevzem mora biti ekonomsko upravičen, torej morata biti prevzemno in prevzeto podjetje po prevzemu vredni več kot vsako posamezno pred prevzemom. Glavna slabost združitev je samodejen prevzem vseh znanih in neznanih obveznosti prevzetega podjetja. Za uspešne združitve in prevzeme podjetij je potrebno narediti podroben poslovni načrt, oceniti vse elemente tržne, proizvodne, organizacijske in kadrovske narave, ki vplivajo na pričakovane donose in vrednost podjetja. Če bi Mercator prevzel Merkur, bi ta združitev podjetij prinesla precej priložnosti, ki bi še povečale pozitiven učinek prevzema. Mercator bi lahko dosegel svoj strateški cilj in postal največji trgovec v jugovzhodni Evropi. Hitrejša rast v podjetju bi prinesla boljše poslovne rezultate, trgovsko mrežo bi lahko posodabljali, vodenje strateške poslovne politike bi bilo lažje in dolgoročno bi se lahko maksimirala vrednost podjetja. Finančno in poslovno okrepljeni Mercator bi lahko še agresivneje nastopal na sedanjih in novih trgih s celovito zaključenim prodajnim programom. S skupnim nastopom na prodajnih trgih bi se zmanjšali stroški in povečala učinkovitost. Zmanjševalo bi se tudi poslovno tveganje. Z razširitvijo trgovske mreže, z novimi površinami in s skupnim nastopom novega podjetja na prodajnih trgih bi imeli koristi tudi potrošniki. Due to {{globalisation}} takeovers {{have got}} to be part of everyday routine. Most theories foresee positive effects for not only is the business efficiency of the company increased but also the synergy of the economy of the extent of business operation is achieved all of which is direct consequence of new combinations of formerly separated companies or direct consequence of reduction of costs. The takeover company acquires a certain share of ownership rights (stock share) of the company which is has taken over and the said share provides supervision share which makes it possible for the takeover company to discharge crucial influence upon the operation of the company which has been taken over. Any form of takeover can be performed through payments in cash, indebtedness of the company, exchange of stocks or other securities. Takeover is defined as the case where two or more companies are merged into a single one in that is has to be performed in accordance with the existing legislature. As far as merger goes there are fusions and annexations. A successfully discharged takeover is usually followed by a merger of the companies in question. As regards the discharge of obligations and achievements of mutual goals takeovers and mergers always bring about changes and different attitudes. A takeover has to be economically justified hence the takeover company and the taken-over company have to be worth more than before it. The main drawback of a merger is automatic acceptance of all known as well as unknown liabilities of the taken-over company. A successful takeover and <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> calls for a precise business plan thus all the elements of marketing, production, organizational and personnel management nature, which can influence the anticipated revenues and values of the company, have to be thoroughly studied and assessed. If "Mercator" should takeover "Merkur" the merger would provide a number of opportunities which would enhance the positive effects of the takeover in that "Mercator" would be able to achieve its strategic goal in getting to be the largest merchant of Southeast Europe. A faster growth of the company would bring about better business results, the trading network could be brought up to date, strategic business policy would be easier and, in the long run, the value of the company would be maximized. It would be possible for the financially invigorated "Mercator" to do business not only on its current markets but also on new ones more aggressively {{with the help of an}} integrally balanced sales program. Through mutual appearance on various markets costs could be minimized and efficiency could be increased whereby business risks would be reduced. The consumers, too, would gain a lot through expansion of sales network, new sales space and joint appearance of the new joint company on the market...|$|E
