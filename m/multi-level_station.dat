50|$|The group {{runs around}} the <b>multi-level</b> <b>station</b> looking for UM-86 {{but it is}} nowhere to be found. Maintenance workers at the bottom level also heard the sound, but presumed it was coming from the top level, where Pratt and the others were located. Upon hearing this, the {{director}} orders that all power be turned off in the line, which has little effect other than further angering the committee.|$|E
50|$|After both {{lines were}} rebuilt as rapid transit {{lines of the}} Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, the name Bath Junction was dropped. A {{connector}} was no longer necessary, as the West End Line was able to reach Manhattan on its own, and was not even realistic to plan, as one line dropped into a cut and the other became elevated. The <b>multi-level</b> <b>station</b> complex was created to allow passenger transfer between the two lines.|$|E
50|$|Particularly unusual are the <b>multi-level</b> <b>stations</b> in Osnabrück (crossing {{with the}} Hanoverian Western Railway) and Dülmen (crossing with the Dortmund-Enschede railway).|$|R
50|$|Some metro {{stations}} are interchanges, serving to transfer passengers between lines or transport systems. The platforms may be <b>multi-level.</b> Transfer <b>stations</b> handle more passengers than regular stations, with additional connecting tunnels and larger concourses to reduce walking times and manage crowd flows.|$|R
2500|$|Stratford {{is a major}} <b>multi-level</b> {{interchange}} <b>station</b> {{serving the}} district of Stratford and the mixed-use development known as Stratford City, in the London Borough of Newham, east London. It is served by the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and is also a National Rail station on the Great Eastern Main Line, [...] from Liverpool Street.|$|R
50|$|The Milan-Bologna segment {{opened on}} 13 December 2008. Its {{construction}} cost was about 6.9 billion euro. The 182 km line runs {{parallel to the}} Autostrada del Sole, crossing seven provinces and 32 municipalities. There are eight connections with historic lines. At the Reggio Emilia interconnection a new station designed by the Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava was opened in June 2013. Calatrava has also designed a signature bridge where the line crosses the A1 motorway. The line travels through a new <b>multi-level</b> <b>station</b> at Bologna (Italy's principal railway junction) designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989 a {{brand new}} station {{concourse}} was opened by InterCity, including a shopping arcade named after Brunel, opened on {{the western end of}} the old [...] station site, linked to the platforms of the main station by a new footbridge. At the same time a new <b>multi-level</b> <b>station</b> car park was built {{on the site of the}} former goods yard and signal works to the north of the station, and linked to the same footbridge. The station facilities in the 1860 station building were converted into The Three Guineas public house. The Queen reopened the station on 4 April 1989.|$|E
50|$|Alandur metro {{station is}} an {{elevated}} metro station {{that is part}} of the Blue Line and the Green Line of the Chennai Metro, and serves as an interchange station between the two lines. The station is one of the two metro stations where the two lines intersect, the other being the Chennai Central metro station. It is the city's first <b>multi-level</b> railway <b>station.</b> It is the only station where passengers from the two corridors can swap the direction of travel.|$|R
50|$|A {{project to}} rebuild the line to Ferrandina, which has a station on the Battipaglia-Potenza-Metaponto line (linking Salerno and Taranto), has been {{considered}} by the Ferrovie dello Stato. Works for the line, projected to use the , started in 1986 to give Matera a direct rail link to the national network, following in part the former route. Due to lack of funds construction has ceased, with the works incomplete and structures abandoned. Due to {{the distance to the}} town's centre (7 km) of the partly built new FS station, which is located in the frazione of La Martella, it has been proposed to use the former route south of the town and to upgrade Matera Centrale, rebuilt as a <b>multi-level</b> underground <b>station</b> or simply enlarged.|$|R
50|$|The Bologna-Florence segment {{opened on}} 12 December 2009, {{allowing}} a 37-minute journey {{between the two}} cities. The Bologna-Florence high-speed section was particularly complex to build mainly because about 93% of its 78.5 km runs through tunnels under the Apennines range. The line has nine tunnels, from 600 meters to 18.5 km long, separated by short surface stretches (less than 5 km in total). Florence will have a major new <b>multi-level</b> high speed <b>station</b> at Belfiore designed by British architect Norman Foster.|$|R
5000|$|The transit {{center was}} {{designed}} by EE&K. The plan for the structure {{would have been a}} modern glass and steel building surrounding a [...] "great space". Because the facility would have been built over the tracks, one of the dominant features would have been a grand staircase. The center was designed as a <b>multi-level</b> <b>station</b> with heavy rail (commuter, Amtrak, Union Pacific freight) running under a large public space with light rail running via an elevated structure. Main Street would have been split into Upper Main Street, with access to the station {{at the level of the}} public space in a loop, and Lower Main Street, which would have gone underneath the entire station and continued on as North Main Street.|$|E
500|$|System Shock {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The game is set inside a large, <b>multi-level</b> space <b>station,</b> in which players explore, combat enemies and solve puzzles. Progress is largely non-linear {{and the game}} is designed to allow for emergent gameplay. As in , the player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons, to interact with objects and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, and crawl. Practical uses for these actions include taking cover, retrieving items from beneath the player character and navigating small passages, respectively. The HUD also features three [...] "Multi-Function Displays", which may be configured to display information such as weapon readouts, an automap and an inventory.|$|R
50|$|After the war, various {{services}} were reestablished. The local trains {{that had been}} operating between Shinjuku and Inada-Noborito station were run on the whole line, and Hon-Atsugi became a stop for local trains. At the same time, through trains were abolished (June 1945). Consecutively Semi-Express (October 1, 1946), Express (October 1, 1949), Commuting express (March 25, 1955) and Commuting Semi-Express (March 25, 1960) {{services were}} introduced. On November 5, 1964 the connection to the Sagami Railway was cut. From 1968 the Romancecar began stops at Hon-Atsugi Station. From June 1976 the station building was rebuilt into an overhead <b>station.</b> <b>Multi-level</b> crossings were successively constructed around the station (March 29, 1977) and from March 31, 1978, the line operated jointly with the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line and the JR Jōban Line. Later (March 23, 1982), the Mylord Department Store opened within the station building and the first two automatic ticket machines were installed.|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of life safety {{in case of}} a building re is based on thecomparison of the available safe egress time (ASET) and the requiredsafe egress time (RSET). With regards to simulation experiments, thisstraightforward approach is accompanied by uncertainties including theunderlying models, the specication of inputs, and the analysis of outputs. Concerning the two latter aspects, this thesis introduces methodologicalextensions in order to conduct ASET-RSET analyses in a multivariatefashion. For the specication of inputs, the multitude of possible scenariosis represented with the help of systematic sampling techniques. Uncertainties in terms of analysis are tackled with multi-criterial mapsrendering both ASET and RSET in spacious environments. The subtractionof both maps is used to determine a measure of consequences. These methods are applied to a <b>multi-level</b> underground <b>station</b> which isinvestigated with numerical simulations based on the formation of two subsystems,namely Fire and Evacuation. The analysis incorporates an ensembleof 8; 640 combined re scenarios and evacuation scenarios. Throughoutthe entire design space, more than 95 % of the scenario combinationsaccount for {{less than half of the}} maximal observed consequences. Thisanalysis is rened by agglomerative clustering in order to group all observationshierarchically. It becomes evident that the lowest margins ofconsequences are represented by two clusters covering approximately 75 %of all observations. The investigation of the parametric relations of allclusters allows for the systematic identication of the determining characteristicsof re and evacuation scenarios. In addition to the consequencemeasure derived from ASET-RSET, fractional eective doses (FED) arecalculated to supplement the analysis. Within the clusters, the numberof occupants exceeding common FED thresholds applicable to incapacitationcorresponds to the introduced ASET-RSET measure. However,throughout the entire design space, this correspondence is not clear andneeds further investigation...|$|R
