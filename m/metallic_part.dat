25|$|Electrotyping {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. Electrotyping and electroforming both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. Electroforming involves {{the production of a}} <b>metallic</b> <b>part</b> around a metallic mandrel, although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, electrotyping forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a thin coating of graphite or metal powder.|$|E
60|$|An {{issue of}} notes is a {{manifest}} gain to the issuers, who, until the notes are returned for payment, obtain {{the use of}} {{them as if they}} were a real capital; and, so long as the notes are no permanent addition to the currency, but merely supersede gold or silver to the same amount, the gain of the issuer is a loss to no one; it is obtained by saving to the community the expense of the more costly material. But, if there is no gold or silver to be superseded—if the notes are added to the currency, instead of being substituted for the <b>metallic</b> <b>part</b> of it—all holders of currency lose, by the depreciation of its value, the exact equivalent of what the issuer gains. A tax is virtually levied on them for his benefit.|$|E

Additionally, {{the ability to}} build functionally graded, unitized parts directly from CAD data offers enhanced performance in numerous applications. Recently, LaRC has become home to this new type of machining process, which is used by their new room-sized electron-emitting device, which uses a High Frequency 42 kW, X-ray emitting electron gun (similar to Cathode Ray Tubes), which quickly melts either aluminum or titanium wire (positioned by dual independent wire feeders) into the desired 3-dimensional <b>metallic</b> <b>parts</b> with a material strength {{comparable to that of}} wrought products.

5000|$|The {{terminal}} die state, as {{the name}} would seem to indicate, is the last state in which any die is used. This state refers to a die that is starting to develop serious structural failures through cracks. A die {{in such a state}} would, if not removed from service, become unserviceable by breaking apart. Like any <b>metallic</b> <b>part,</b> dies are subject to failure from the enormous pressures used to impress the image of the die onto the blank planchet. Some dies were removed when even a microscopic defect is observed, while others were used until they literally broke into pieces. The Bass Foundation has a particularly noteworthy example of an 1806/4 Quarter Eagle ($2.50 gold US coin) in which a piece of the die has broken away, resulting in a heavy rim break over the [...] "LI" [...] in [...] "LIBERTY" [...] on the front.|$|E
50|$|The size {{of those}} used in England and America from the 17th century were about two inches high and about two in diameter. They held about four ounces of wine. Although there were other kinds of emetics in this time period available, many {{households}} possessed an antimonial cup of their own. The instructions typically were to fill the antimonial cup at 6 PM with white wine and take all the wine at 7 AM {{the next morning to}} induce vomiting. A child was instructed to take just half the amount. If it had not induced vomiting within a couple of hours, then they were to take {{the other half of the}} liquid. This method of using wine to gather a small portion of the <b>metallic</b> <b>part</b> of antimony was dependent on the acidity of the wine. If the wine was too acidic, then the concoction could become too strong for the body, resulting in poisoning or even death.|$|E
