60|$|The upper {{course of}} the Soane being in some places confined, and exposed to furious gusts from the gullies of the Kymore hills, and at others {{expanding}} into a broad and flat valley, presents many fluctuations of temperature. The mean temperature is much above that of the lower parts of the same valley (below Tura), the excess amounting to 5.4 degrees. The nights and mornings are cooler, by 1.2 degrees, the days hotter by 10 degrees.

60|$|During my stay at Tungu, {{from the}} 23rd to the 30th of July, no day passed without much {{deposition}} of moisture, but generally in so light {{a form that}} throughout the whole time but one inch was registered in the rain-gauge; {{during the same time}} four inches and a half of rain fell at Dorjiling, and three inches and a half at Calcutta. The mean temperature was 50 degrees (max. 65 degrees, min. 40.7 degrees); extremes, 65/38 degrees. The <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> (23.3 degrees) was thus much greater than at Dorjiling, where it was only 8.9 degrees. A thermometer, sunk three feet, varied only a few tenths from 57.6 degrees. By twenty-five comparative observations with Calcutta, 1 degree Fahr. is the equivalent of every 362 feet of ascent; and twenty comparative observations with Dorjiling give 1 degree for every 340 feet. The barometer rose and fell at the same hours as at lower elevations; the tide amounting to 0.060 inch, between 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m.|$|E
6000|$|We visited Palung twice, chiefly {{in hopes}} that Dr. Campbell might see the {{magnificent}} prospect of Kinchinjhow from its plains: {{the first time we}} gained little beyond a ducking, but on the second (October the 15th) the view was superb; and I likewise caught a glimpse of Kinchinjunga from the neighbouring heights, bearing south 60 degrees west and distant forty miles. I also measured barometrically the elevation at the great chait on the plains, and found it 15,620 feet, and by carefully boiled thermometers, 15,283, on the 13th October, and 15,566 on the 15th: the difference being due to the higher temperature on the latter day, and to a rise of 0.3 degree on both boiling-point thermometers above what the same instruments stood at on the 13th. The elevation of Tungu from the October barometrical observations was only seven feet higher than that given by those of July; the respective heights being 12,766 feet in July, and 12,773 in October.* [The elevation of Tungu by boiling-point was 12,650 feet by a set of July observations, 12,818 by a set taken on the 11th of October, and 12,544 by a set on the 14th of October: the discrepancies were partly due to the temperature corrections, but mainly to the readings of the thermometers, which were-- July 28, sunset 189.5, air 47.3 degrees, elev. 12,650 Oct. 11, noon [...] 189.5, air 37.6 degrees, elev. 12,818 Oct. 14, sunset 190.1, air 45.3 degrees, elev. 12,544] The mean temperature had fallen from 50 degrees in July to 41 degrees, and that of the sunk thermometer from 57 degrees to 51.4 degrees. The <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> in July was 23.3 degrees, and in October 13.8 degrees; the weather during the latter period being, however, uniformly cold and misty, this was much below the mean monthly range, which probably exceeds 30 degrees.

40|$|Pepstatin is {{a potent}} aspartyl proteinase {{inhibitor}} which is virtually insoluble in physiological media. Five semi-synthetic amphipathic analogues of pepstatin, prepared by N terminal substitution of native pepstatin with hydrophilic oligopeptides, have been assessed {{for their ability to}} protect the mucosa in two animal models of acute gastric erosions. Concentrations of approximately 90 pmol/mg were achieved in the rat gastric mucosa after oral administration of a 20 mmol solution. These levels are theoretically adequate to inhibit all pepsin like proteinase activity (including zymogens). Each pepstatin analogue was tested by intragastric administration in a controlled hypotension/luminal acid animal model of acute gastric erosions in a group of six animals. All the inhibitors tested produced marked mucosal protection, as measured by a mucosal damage index, compared with control animals (control <b>mean</b> 241, <b>range</b> 100 - 420; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Orn-Orn-Cys (10 mmol) <b>mean</b> 3, <b>range</b> 0 - 8, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Cysteic acid-Cysteic acid (10 mmol) <b>mean</b> 5, <b>range</b> 0 - 21, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Lys-Lys (10 mmol) <b>mean</b> 18, <b>range</b> 0 - 60, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Cysteic acid-Cysteic acid (1 mmol) <b>mean</b> 24, <b>range</b> 0 - 86, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Orn-Orn-Cys (1 mmol) <b>mean</b> 57, <b>range</b> 0 - 116, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Asp-Asp (1 mg/ml suspension) <b>mean</b> 68, <b>range</b> 19 - 126, p less than 0. 01; Pepstatinyl-Arg-OMe (1 mmol) <b>mean</b> 93, <b>range</b> 4 - 142, p less than 0. 05, Pepstatinyl-Gly-Lys-Lys (1 mmol) <b>mean</b> 157, <b>range</b> 70 - 286, NS).

50|$|Due to its {{geographic}} setting {{along the}} Eastern Continental Divide and its extreme topographic variation, Henderson County presents a wide variation in temperature and precipitation conditions. The highest elevations occur along the northwest and northern {{boundaries of the}} county and within the Blue Ridge Escarpment, a rugged area of peaks and narrow valleys that rise from the Piedmont to the continental divide and the Blue Ridge Plateau. The lowest elevations occur within the valleys of the escarpment and in the broader valleys of the Blue Ridge Plateau. The mean annual temperature of the county is 55.1°F, with a range from 50.3 to 57.9°F depending on the elevation, with higher temperatures occurring at lower elevations and lower temperatures in the higher mountains. The month of July is the hottest in the county, with a mean temperature of 72.6°F and a <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> of 66.6 to 75.8°F. The coolest month is January with a mean temperature of 36.9°F and a <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> of 33.3 to 39.5°F. Precipitation is also correlated to elevation, with higher precipitation normally occurring at higher elevations and lower precipitation in the valleys. The mean annual precipitation of Henderson County is 56.2 inches, with a <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> of 45.04 to 78.03 inches. March has the highest mean precipitation of 5.1 inches, with a <b>mean</b> <b>range</b> of 3.9 to 6.7 inches.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} fluctuation in circulating von Willebrand factor (vWF) in {{the outcome}} of patients with temporal arteritis. METHODS: Plasma vWF antigen concentrations were measured in 65 patients with biopsy proven temporal arteritis at different disease activity stages, in 12 with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica, and in 16 controls. Fourteen temporal arteritis patients underwent serial determinations during the course of their disease. RESULTS: vWF concentrations were significantly raised in temporal arteritis (mean 220 [arbitrary units], range 96 to 720) and in polymyalgia rheumatica (<b>mean</b> 196, <b>range</b> 103 to 266) compared with healthy controls (<b>mean</b> 98, <b>range</b> 75 to 137) (P < 0. 05). Although vWF values tended to be higher in temporal arteritis, {{no significant differences were found}} between temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica patients nor between temporal arteritis patients with ischaemic complications (<b>mean</b> 269, <b>range</b> 130 to 720) and those who presented with polymyalgia rheumatica or constitutional symptoms only (<b>mean</b> 179, <b>range</b> 140 to 220). The highest levels were obtained in patients with associated, mainly infectious, diseases (<b>mean</b> 631, <b>range</b> 240 to 1680). Raised vWF values found in active temporal arteritis patients (<b>mean</b> 220, <b>range</b> 96 to 720) persisted within the first two years after the beginning of treatment (<b>mean</b> 244, <b>range</b> 102 to 510) but tended to normalise in patients in long term remission (<b>mean</b> 143, <b>range</b> 50 to 260). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent elevation of vWF during early remission of temporal arteritis might represent an endothelial activation status induced by a remaining inflammatory microenvironment rather than a marker of endothelial cell injury. In long term remission, decreasing vWF concentrations might reflect progression of inflammatory lesions to a healing stage...|$|R
