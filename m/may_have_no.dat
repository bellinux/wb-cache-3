5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E

5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E

5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E
5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much talk about whether a general {{election}} will or should take place before 2020, the key arguments behind it being that Theresa <b>May</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> mandate to carry out her programme, while also <b>having</b> <b>no</b> mandate to negotiate the exact terms of Brexit. Calling an early election would therefore be a single-topic vote. Yossi Nehushtan argues that such an outcome would be anti-democratic...|$|R
5|$|Bellaire {{currently}} has a city manager style of government. The home rule government was established on April 2, 1949, replacing the general law form of government. The city council {{is made up}} of the mayor and six city council members. All are elected at large. The mayor is elected for two-year terms, while each city council member is elected for four-year terms. The mayor may not serve for more than four terms in that position. A council members <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> more than two terms as a city council member. Bellaire has zoning ordinances that dictate types of structures and uses throughout sections of the city. As of 2015, the mayor is Dr. Phil Nauert. The six council members are, in order of position, Roman F. Reed (1), Jim Avioli, Sr. (2), Gus Pappas (3), Pat McLaughlan (4), Andrew S. Friedberg (5), and Mandy Nathan (6).|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E

5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
