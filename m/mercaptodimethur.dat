5000|$|Methiocarb is a {{carbamate}} pesticide {{which is}} used as a bird repellent, insecticide, acaricide and molluscicide [...] since the 1960s. Carbamates are widely used in agriculture as insecticides and herbicides. They are preferred instead of organochlorines because organochlorines are long lasting persistent in crops. Methiocarb has contact and stomach action on mites and neurotoxic effects on molluscs. Seeds treated with methiocarb also affects birds. Like the other carbamates, methiocarb inhibits reversibly acetylcholinesterase activity resulting in a cholinergic stimulation making methiocarb a potent neurotoxin. It can even cause acute toxicity in humans if exposed {{for long periods of time}} or a sufficient dose. It is not listed as a carcinogen. [...] Methiocarb is also a known poison to water organisms. Other names for methiocarb are mesurol and <b>mercaptodimethur.</b>|$|E
