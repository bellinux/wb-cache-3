5|$|Introduction of the Local Government Bill in March 1888 caused <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> in the Potteries {{about the}} {{position}} of the towns under the proposed council structure. The bill proposed the creation of county councils across England and Wales and the granting of county borough status to towns with a population exceeding 100,000. County borough status would allow such places to govern themselves independently of the county council.|$|E

The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the ways}} that the {{government}} could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also manufactured in the United States, to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing, pecuniary boundaries, and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities. Congress shelved the report without <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of the General Welfare clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> among historians.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Luongo was {{selected}} to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter, there was <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> among the media {{as to whether he}} or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price would play most of Canada's games. With head coach Mike Babcock electing Price, Luongo received one start in the tournament, a round robin game against Austria, in which he recorded a 6-0 shutout. As a backup, earned his second Olympic gold medal, as Canada went on to defeat Sweden in the final 3-0.|$|E

5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|Reig {{believed}} Herrerasaurus was {{an early}} example of a carnosaur, {{but this was the}} subject of <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified Herrerasaurus as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using cladistic analysis, some researchers put Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus {{at the base of the}} dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.|$|E
5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern forgery. If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.|$|E

Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without <b>much</b> <b>debate,</b> as the line {{naturally}} {{went through all}} the towns {{and most of the}} important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. Scheduled services on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E

The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject of}} <b>much</b> <b>debate,</b> but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E

This distinction is also <b>much</b> <b>debated</b> but the typical assumptions as to its meaning can be illustrated by works from each group discussed {{in the next two}} sections; both are famous masterpieces and National Treasures of Japan.|$|R
5|$|The mid-18th century saw an {{upsurge in}} the public's {{fear of being}} mistakenly buried alive, and <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> about the {{uncertainty}} of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of <b>much</b> <b>debate.</b> It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to <b>much</b> <b>debate</b> in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
