40|$|Abstract. The <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of the aluminum hot rolling process. The <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> used for transmission of rotational power with heavy-duty load. Fracture of the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> causes serious economic injury because an <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> is a very expensive component and {{takes a long time to}} repair. To prevent the destruction of the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> it is essential for mechanical life cycle to be known. In this paper, a parameter study on <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> was performed in order to minimize maximum stress of an <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> under static loads. To verify the interference of spindle assembly with modified <b>end</b> <b>coupling,</b> kinematic simulation was performed by applying the various combination type and dynamic boundary condition of the spindle assembly. The interference of an optimized model did not occur during combination process and driving process. As a result of an optimum design for life extension on <b>end</b> <b>coupling,</b> the maximum stress of <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> was reduced about 26 % compared with original model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{comparison}} between two methods of <b>coupling,</b> <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> and edge coupling, between microstrip line and cylindrical dielectric resonator (CDR) in a microwave integrated-circuit (MIC) environment is presented. The dielectric resonator is coupled to both open-circuited and short-circuited microstrip lines. The analysis is performed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. It was shown that the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> configuration excites the hybrid electromagnetic modes (HEMmnp) {{with respect to the}} axis of rotation of the resonator. The edge coupling configuration also excites these modes at almost the same resonant frequencies in addition to the axis symmetric mode TE 01 δ. The comparison between <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> and edge coupling configurations shows that the edge coupling has better values for insertion loss when the ends of the microstrip lines are open-circuited, whereas the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> offers better mode separation and sharper resonance curves when the ends of the microstrip lines are short-circuited...|$|R
