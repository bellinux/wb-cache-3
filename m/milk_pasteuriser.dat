30|$|It {{should be}} noted that under the OVOP {{programme}} the Bvumbwe Milk Cooperative has improved productivity and reduced the loss of milk collected from its members. Milk production has increased from 13 litres to 27 litres per animal per day. The establishment of the cooperative has made it possible for them to negotiate with Dairibord better prices as the quality of milk produced is of a high standard. This has also led to {{an increase in the number}} of farmers and animals in the cooperative, increasing from 12 to 117. JICA supplied the Bvumbwe with a <b>milk</b> <b>pasteuriser</b> and milk packaging machine in 2003 for the cooperative to sell milk directly to consumers and not through the major milk companies (One village one group (OVOP) 2011).|$|E
40|$|This Project Report identifies, in the Dairy Industry, a market. need {{which can}} be {{satisfied}} {{by the development of}} an annular laminar flow convection assisted <b>milk</b> <b>pasteuriser.</b> It is shown, through experimental work on a full sized model, that the original design concepts envisaged were unsound, but that a revised design could prove to be commercially viable. Mathematical relationships are derived relating to the specific flow and heat exchange conditions. Comparison of these results with existing publications enhances the findings of some other workers, while casting doubt on the validity of certain accepted material. In keeping with modern farming trends, the report examines the feasibility of PC usage in this application and offers it as an alternative to a proprietary control system...|$|E
40|$|For example, {{how can one}} feed 'raw ' milk of 'low {{bacterial}} count ' when an analysis of {{bacterial count}} may take {{at least a day}} and the milk must be stored (and is therefore no longer 'raw') during that time? Is there evidence that milk of 'low bacterial count ' is always low in number of potential pathogens? How does one decide upon a 'minimum pasteurising temperature for bacterial killing', when this may vary depending on the species of bacteria present? Are milk cells of any importance in milks that are collected from donors past the colostrum period and, if so, how can they be protected when milk is routinely frozen? Finally, contrary to the statement of Evans et al., a commercial small-scale human <b>milk</b> <b>pasteuriser</b> does exist in the UK (Vickers) ...|$|E
