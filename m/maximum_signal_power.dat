Even the cheaper home-use models (typically band selective) now provide 20 dB - 50 dB gain {{and many of the}} more {{expensive}} models provide over 50 dB. Excellent high-power models (used for by commercial operators) offer a gain of around 100 dBm (Interference cancellation equipment function is an improvement of the radio isolation between donor and service antenna). However, since decibels are logarithmic a 30 dB gain represents a one thousandfold signal power increase - meaning the total amplification of a repeater with greater than around 50 dB is likely to be useless without a good, well aligned antenna.

To cope with the in-band self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference, we formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) based linear transceiver design problem. The problem jointly optimizes the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) beamforming vectors of the BS and the transmission powers of UL users so as to provide both the DL and UL users with guaranteed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio performance, using a minimum UL and DL transmission sum power. The considered system model not only takes into account noise caused by non-ideal RF circuits, analog/digital SI cancellation but also constrains the <b>maximum</b> <b>signal</b> <b>power</b> at the input of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for avoiding signal distortion due to finite ADC precision. The formulated design problem is not convex and challenging to solve in general. We first show that for a special case where the SI channel estimation errors are independent and identically distributed, the QoS-based linear transceiver design problem is globally solvable by a polynomial-time bisection algorithm. For the general case, we propose a suboptimal algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO). The AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. To reduce {{the complexity of the}} AO algorithm, we further develop a fixed-point method by extending the classical uplink-downlink duality in HD systems to the FD system.

30|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the interference alignment (IA) solution for a K-user MIMO interference channel. Proper users’ precoders and decoders are designed through a desired signal power maximization model with IA conditions as constraints, which forms a complex matrix optimization problem. We propose two low complexity algorithms, {{both of which}} apply the Courant penalty function technique to combine the leakage interference and the desired signal power together as the new objective function. The first proposed algorithm is the modified alternating minimization algorithm (MAMA), where each subproblem has closed-form solution with an eigenvalue decomposition. To further reduce algorithm complexity, we propose a hybrid algorithm which consists of two parts. As the first part, the algorithm iterates with Householder transformation to preserve the orthogonality of precoders and decoders. In each iteration, the matrix optimization problem is considered in a sequence of 2 D subspaces, which leads to one dimensional optimization subproblems. From any initial point, this algorithm obtains precoders and decoders with low leakage interference in short time. In the second part, to exploit the advantage of MAMA, it continues to iterate to perfectly align the interference from the output point of the first part. Analysis shows that in one iteration generally both proposed two algorithms have lower computational complexity than the existed <b>maximum</b> <b>signal</b> <b>power</b> (MSP) algorithm, and the hybrid algorithm enjoys lower complexity than MAMA. Simulations reveal that both proposed algorithms achieve similar performances as the MSP algorithm with less executing time, and show better performances than the existed alternating minimization algorithm in terms of sum rate. Besides, from the view of convergence rate, simulation {{results show that the}} MAMA enjoys fastest speed with respect to a certain sum rate value, while hybrid algorithm converges fastest to eliminate interference.|$|E

40|$|Base station (BS) {{sleeping}} {{has emerged}} as a viable solution to enhance the overall network energy efficiency by inactivating the underutilized BSs. However, it affects the performance of users in sleeping cells depending on their BS association criteria, their channel conditions towards the active BSs, and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the active BSs. This paper characterizes the performance of cellular systems with BS sleeping by developing a systematic framework to derive the spectral efficiency and outage probability of downlink transmission to the sleeping cell users taking into account the aforementioned factors. In this context, we develop a user association scheme in which a typical user in a sleeping cell selects a BS with Maximum best-case Mean channel Access Probability (MMAP) which is calculated by all active BSs based on their existing traffic loads. We consider both greedy and round-robin schemes at active BSs for scheduling users in a channel. Once the association is performed, the exact access probability for a typical sleeping cell user and the statistics of its received <b>signal</b> and interference <b>powers</b> are derived to evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission. For the sleeping cell users, we also consider the conventional <b>Maximum</b> Received <b>Signal</b> <b>Power</b> (MRSP) -based user association scheme along with greedy and round-robin schemes at the BSs. The impact of cell-zooming is incorporated in the derivations to analyze its feasibility in reducing the coverage holes created by BS sleeping. Numerical results show the trade-offs between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in various network scenarios. The accuracy of the analysis is verified through Monte-Carlo simulations.
