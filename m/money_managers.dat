50|$|In this infographic example, {{there are}} four investors each with a {{different}} amount of risk capital that choose the same <b>money</b> <b>manager.</b> The <b>money</b> <b>manager</b> trades the entire capital, $100,000 total, on one master account (the <b>money</b> <b>manager</b> can only trade the accounts; no access to the investorâ€™s funds is permitted to withdraw any <b>money).</b> The <b>money</b> <b>manager</b> then makes a profit of $12,500, and because in this example the commission fee is 20% that equals to $2,500 in commissions for the <b>money</b> <b>manager.</b> This leaves $110,000 in the master account. The $10,000 profit made will now be credited back to the investors accounts based on the percentage of their share of risk capital in the pool.|$|R

25|$|Warren Buffett {{has also}} argued against EMH, {{most notably in}} his 1984 {{presentation}} The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, saying the preponderance of value investors among the world's best <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> rebuts the claim of EMH proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others. As Malkiel has shown, over the 30 years (to 1996) {{more than two-thirds of}} professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the S 500 Index (and, more to the point, there is little correlation between those who outperform in one year and those who outperform in the next).|$|E
25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{fail and}} {{unsuccessful}} stories related with stock trading abound.

This allow widespread promotion of inaccurate and unproven trading methods for stocks, bonds, commodities, or Forex, while generating sizable revenues for unscrupulous authors, advisers and self-titled trading gurus.

25|$|All {{things being}} equal, {{at any given}} time, if the {{maturity}} of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher CDS spread is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> {{to be the best}} indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.|$|E
25|$|Even Michael Steinhardt, {{who made}} his fortune trading in time horizons ranging from 30 minutes to 30 days, claimed to take a {{long-term}} perspective on his investment decisions. From an economic perspective, many professional <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> and financial advisors shy away from day trading, arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk. Attempting {{to make a profit}} is the reason investors invest, and buy low and sell high is the general goal of most investors (although short-selling and arbitrage take a different approach, {{the success or failure of}} these strategies still depends on timing).|$|E

25|$|Recklessness, greed, and overoptimism {{played a}} part in the early-20th-century {{financial}} crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the Palliser Triangle, a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments.

500|$|In 1994, SBC {{followed}} up its acquisition of O'Connor by acquiring Brinson Partners an asset management firm focused on providing access for US institutions to global markets. [...] Founded by Gary P. Brinson, an innovator in financial management, Brinson Partners had {{emerged as one}} of largest managers of pension plans and also managed a series of mutual funds. [...] Brinson was a pioneer {{in the development of the}} theory of asset allocation which had largely become conventional wisdom among <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> in the 1980s and 1990s. [...] Brinson had begun working at First Chicago Corporation in the 1970s and by 1981 began building the business that would become Brinson Partners. [...] In 1989, Brinson led a US$100million management buyout of his firm from First Chicago Corporation and over the next five years built up the firm to approximately US$36billion of assets under management. [...] SBC paid US$750million to acquire Brinson Partners, which resulted in a profit to Brinson and his partners of US$460million on the sale of their 75% stake in the company. [...] Following the acquisition of Brinson Partners, Gary Brinson ran SBC's asset management business and after the merger with UBS, Brinson was named chief investment officer of UBS Global Asset Management.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{warrants}} to <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> {{were especially}} problematic.

[...] At worst, the warrants {{could have been}} construed as bribes to the <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> to influence decisions they made for their funds. [...] Indeed, several <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> were eventually convicted on bribery charges. [...] The discovery of MacPherson Partnersâ€”whose very existence had not been known {{to the public at}} the timeâ€”seriously eroded Milken's credibility with the board. [...] On December 21, 1988, Drexel entered a guilty plea to six counts of stock parking and stock manipulation.

[...] Even if some <b>money</b> <b>managers</b> are consistently observed to beat the market, no refutation even of strong-form efficiency follows: with hundreds of thousands of fund managers worldwide, even a normal distribution of returns (as efficiency predicts) should be expected to produce a few dozen [...] "star" [...] performers.|$|E
