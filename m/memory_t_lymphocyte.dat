Requirements for the generation of this T-cell subset, described as CD 62 L+CCR 7 +CD 45 RA+CD 45 R 0 +IL- 7 Rα+CD 95 +, are CD 3 /CD 28 engagement and culture with IL- 7 and IL- 15.

CXCR 4 -tropic HIV- 1 -infected mice were quickly depleted of CD 4 + thymocytes and both CD 45 RA+ naïve and CD 45 RA− memory CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> while CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 -infected mice were preferentially depleted of CD 45 RA− memory CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Staining of HIV- 1 p 24 antigen revealed that CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 preferentially infected effector <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TEM) rather than central <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In addition, the majority of p 24 + cells in CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 -infected mice were activated and in cycling phase.

This occurred {{in the absence of any}} other exogenous signal. Furthermore, there was no evidence of an inflammatory or necrotic response in the tissues, indicating that this was unlikely to be Fc or complement-mediated antibody killing.

Using mice previously immunized with yeast-derived HIV- 1 p 24 recombinant protein there was sparing of memory T cell function after in vivo anti-CD 4 treatment, except during a window of less than 24 h duration, when simultaneous exposure to antigen and anti-CD 4 antibody resulted in the depletion of specific <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function. This indicated that a very minor alteration in the frequency of apoptosis had a marked effect on cell number over time, and suggested that opportunistic infection associated with CD 4 + T cell depletion may be explained by loss of memory cells when there is antigenic stimulation at the same time as CD 4 ligation.

40|$|Although {{wild birds}} are natural hosts of avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs), these viruses {{can be highly}} contagious to poultry and a zoonotic threat to humans. The propensity of AIV for genetic variation through genetic shift and drift allows virus to evade vaccine mediated humoral immunity. An alternative approach to current vaccine development is induction of CD 8 + T cells which responds to more conserved epitopes than humoral immunity and targets a broader spectrum of viruses. Since the memory CD 8 + T lymphocyte responses in chickens to individual AIV proteins have not been defined, the modulation of responses of the memory CD 8 + T lymphocytes to H 5 N 9 AIV hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleocapsid (NP) proteins over a time course were evaluated. CD 8 + T lymphocyte responses induced by intramuscular inoculation of chickens with AIV HA and NP expressing cDNA plasmids or a non-replicating human adenovirus vector were identified through ex vivo stimulation with virus infected, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matched antigen presenting cells (APCs). The IFN? production by activated lymphocytes was evaluated by macrophage production of nitric oxide and ELISA. MHC-I restricted <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> responses were determined at 10 days and 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks post-inoculation (p. i). The use of non-professional APCs and APC driven proliferation of cells with CD 8 + phenotype correlated with the activation of CD 8 + T lymphocytes. The responses specific to nucleocapsid protein (NP) were consistently greater than those to the hemagglutinin (HA) at 5 weeks when the CD 8 + T cell responses were maximum. By 8 to 9 weeks p. i., responses to either protein were undetectable. The T lymphocytes also responded to stimulation with a heterologous H 7 N 2 AIV infected APCs. Administration of booster dose induced secondary effector cell mediated immune responses which had greater magnitudes than primary effector responses at 10 days p. i. Flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of the T lymphocytes demonstrated that memory CD 8 + T lymphocytes of chickens can be distinguished from naive lymphocytes by their higher expression of CD 44 and CD 45 surface antigens.

The HIV- 1 accessory protein Vpr, which mediates G 2 cell cycle arrest in host cells, may interfere with the formation of the latently infected T cells by preventing them from exiting the cell cycle to return to a resting state. To investigate the role of the Vpr in the formation of latently infected <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> cells, we cloned and characterized vpr genes from viruses in the latent reservoir.

Also IFN-gamma production appeared to play only a minor role in the expression of pulmonary pathology characteristic of Th 1 or Th 2 T-lymphocyte responses, because mice genetically deficient in IFN-gamma production by gene disruption displayed {{the same pattern of}} pulmonary inflammation to RSV infection after priming to RSV F or G as conventional mice. These results suggest that effector <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> exhibit a different pattern of cytokine production than memory T-lymphocyte precursors precommitted to a Th 1 or Th 2 pattern of differentiation. Furthermore, these observations raise the possibility that the cytokine response of human <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> after a single exposure to antigen in vitro may not accurately reflect the cytokine response of differentiated effector <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> at the site of infection in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: The first {{identified}} susceptibility {{gene for}} Crohn's disease, NOD 2, {{acts as a}} sensor for the bacterial-wall peptidoglycan fragment muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Upon NF-κB activation, intestinal macrophages (IMACs) induce expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 3 α to attract <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> We therefore investigated the influence of NOD 2 ligation of IMAC differentiation and functional MIP- 3 α induction. Methods: Human embryonal kidney HEK 293 cells were transfected with NOD 2 wild-type (NOD 2 (WT)) and the NOD 2 SNP 13 variant (NOD 2 (L 1007 fsinsC)) and stimulated with MDP. Recruitment of CD 45 R 0 (+) and Th 17 cells was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Endogenous NOD 2 stimulation {{was followed by a}} dose-dependent increase in MIP- 3 α secretion in MONO-MAC- 6 (MM 6) cells. MIP- 3 α mRNA was also significantly (* p < 0. 05) induced in HEK 293 transfected with NOD 2 (WT) via MDP ligation. In vivo cell-cell contacts between IMACs and CD 45 R 0 (+) <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> cells as well as recruitment of Th 17 cells in patients of NOD 2 variants were unchanged as compared to wild-type patients. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in MIP- 3 α secretion in the human myeloid cell line MM 6 upon MDP. However, MIP- 3 α-driven recruitment of Th 17 cells or CD 45 R 0 (+) <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is not affected in patients carrying heterozygous NOD 2 variants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIL- 17 A was cloned {{more than}} 10 {{years ago and}} six IL- 17 family members (IL- 17 A-F) have {{subsequently}} been described. IL- 17 A is largely produced by activated <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> but stimulates innate immunity and host defense. IL- 17 A and IL- 17 F both mobilize neutrophils partly through granulopoeisis and CXC chemokine induction, as well as increased survival locally. IL- 17 A and IL- 17 F production by <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is regulated by IL- 23 independent of T cell receptor activation. Increasing evidence shows that IL- 17 family members {{play an active role}} in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. This places IL- 17 family members and their receptors as potential targets for future pharmacotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of rats {{suffering}} from florid chronic progressive systemic arthritis or from chronic remitting/relapsing encephalomyelitis with autologous {{bone marrow transplantation}} (BMT) is highly effective. This finding was unexpected as the genotype of the bone marrow largely determines the susceptibility of both spontaneous and induced autoimmune diseases in rodents. The success of autologous stem-cell transplantation depends on the completeness of eradication of the effectors of autoimmune disease, in other words activated and <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The reviewed experimental data, when translated to the clinic, indicate that the patients should be subjected to a conditioning regimen that induces maximal lymphoablation and that the autologous transplant has to be T-cell depleted...|$|R
40|$|Sarcoidosis is {{characterized}} by a cell-mediated response mediated by the activation of CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in an environment lacking adequate numbers of regulatory CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Immunohistological studies on frozen tissues have shown that sarcoid lesions have activated CD 4 helper/inducer <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> at the centre of granulomata, whereas lymphocytes at the periphery are mainly CD 8 suppressor/cytotoxic cells. In this study we investigated the immunohistological distribution of CD 45 isoforms of T cells in 29 paraffin-embedded sarcoid lesions in mediastinal and open lung biopsies. Ten of these were assessed quantitatively, with single-staining of serial sections demonstrating a predominance of CD 45 RO <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in granulomata and intergranulomatous areas. Ratios of CD 45 RO:CD 45 RA <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (or the ratio of <b>memory</b> to naive <b>T</b> cells) were 42. 0 : 1 for granulomata and 17. 9 : 1 for intergranulomatous areas of sarcoid lesions counted. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that nearly all the lymphocytes present in sarcoid lesions have been previously activated, and selectively home to sarcoid lesions...|$|R
40|$|Increasing age {{has been}} {{associated}} with an insufficient protection following vaccination and an increased incidence and severity of infectious diseases. The predicted acceleration of global population aging will accentuate the need to understand the mechanisms that drive the age-related decline of the immune system and to, eventually, identify strategies to lower the burden of infectious diseases in elderly people. One type of immune cell appears to be most dramatically affected by the aging process: <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Age-related changes of the bone marrow and the thymus microenvironment lead to a decreased thymic output of functional, naïve <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> As <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are key players of the adaptive immune system, this research topic will summarize our current understanding on how aging affects the microenvironmental niches and molecular networks that are important for the generation, survival and function of naïve, <b>memory</b> and effector <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> This research topic will also address the impact of aging on the different <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> lineages, such as regulatory T cells and Th 17 cells and how age-related changes of the microenvironment affect organ- and tissue-resident <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Eventually, the identification of a set of markers for immunosenescence would facilitate the design and application of more specific therapies and improved vaccines and vaccination strategies for elderly people, thereby increasing life and health span...|$|R
40|$|Age-matched {{reference}} values for lymphocyte subpopula-tions are generally obtained via cross-sectional studies, whereas patients are followed longitudinally. We performed a detailed longitudinal {{analysis of the}} changes in lymphocyte subpopula-tions in a group of 11 healthy infants followed from birth up to 1 y of age, with special attention for early developmental mark-ers, markers of maturation, and markers of activation. We found that <b>T</b> and B <b>lymphocytes</b> increased at 1 and 6 wk of age, respectively. In contrast, NK cells showed a sharp decline di-rectly after birth, suggesting that they are more important during pregnancy than thereafter. CD 45 RA 1 —mainly CD 41 —naive <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were high at birth, and increased further {{during the first year of}} life; they form a large expanding pool of cells, ready for participation in primary immune responses.

40|$|Certain major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I alleles are strongly associated with control of human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). CD 8 + T cells specific for epitopes restricted by these molecules may be particularly effective. Understanding how CD 8 + T cells contribute to control of viral replication should yield important insights for vaccine design. We have recently identified an Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I allele, Mamu-B* 08, associated with elite control and low plasma viremia after infection with the pathogenic isolate SIVmac 239. Here, we infected four Mamu-B* 08 -positive macaques with SIVmac 239 to investigate why some of these macaques control viral replication. Three of the four macaques controlled SIVmac 239 replication with plasma virus concentrations below 20, 000 viral RNA copies/ml at 20 weeks postinfection; two of four macaques were elite controllers (ECs). Interestingly, {{two of the four}} macaques preserved their CD 4 + <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> during peak viremia, and all four recovered their CD 4 + <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the chronic phase of infection. Mamu-B* 08 -restricted CD 8 + T-cell responses dominated the acute phase and accounted for 23. 3 % to 59. 6 % of the total SIV-specific immune responses. Additionally, the ECs mounted strong and broad CD 8 + T-cell responses against several epitopes in Vif and Nef. Mamu-B* 08 -specific CD 8 + T cells accounted for the majority of mutations in the virus at 18 weeks postinfection. Interestingly, patterns of viral variation in Nef differed between the ECs and the other two macaques. Natural containment of AIDS virus replication in Mamu-B* 08 -positive macaques may, therefore, be related to a combination of immunodominance and viral escape from CD 8 + T-cell responses...|$|R
