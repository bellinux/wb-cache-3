5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. <b>Motion</b> <b>control</b> comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by <b>motion</b> <b>control,</b> with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} <b>motion</b> <b>control,</b> a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose {{container}} and a shampoo bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen.|$|E

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|House of the Dead 4 Special (2006) {{featuring}} large screens enclosing the player, {{as well as}} swivelling, vibrating chairs. Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The Wii {{version has}} earned similar praise, though the <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> scheme has {{received}} mixed reviews. A high-definition port {{of the game}} was released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting {{the use of the}} PlayStation Move motion controller. The high-definition port will also be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December 2017 worldwide. A sequel on the Nintendo DS titled Ōkamiden was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> photography. In part {{a reaction to the}} computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent—such as forced perspective sets.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into Dreams with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title. Before the development of Journey of Dreams, Naka confirmed in retrospective interviews that he had intended to base the next Nights game around a unique motion controller.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, <b>motion</b> <b>control,</b> cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a {{physical}} model of the Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> shots of the Enterprise model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a <b>motion</b> <b>control</b> pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

It features upscaled and filtered graphics, an online leaderboard for players to post high-scores, and Sixaxis <b>motion</b> <b>controls.</b> The game received a mixed reception. Dunham and Gerstmann did not enjoy the <b>motion</b> <b>controls</b> and {{felt it was a}} title only for nostalgic players. Eurogamer.net's Richard Leadbetter judged the game's elements [...] "too simplistic and repetitive to make them worthwhile in 2007". In contrast, Parish considered the title worth purchasing, citing its addictive gameplay.|$|R
