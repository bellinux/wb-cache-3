5|$|In any case, {{there was}} not enough artillery, but new pieces could not be brought in. This was because it was very {{difficult}} to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> over land, and {{there was not}} enough ice to bring them over the sea.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to the USA where they would be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's {{limited use}} of the apartment led to another proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw little reason to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> across the province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular {{use of the}} apartment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, {{with a highly}} bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanian {{refugees}} took {{to using}} bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies could <b>move</b> <b>them</b> into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers to fortify their base at Kukës. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, {{though this was}} not without its risks; {{on at least one}} occasion bunkers along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions {{of a better life}} under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Royal Arsenal renamed {{themselves}} {{for a second time}} upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E

5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will <b>move</b> <b>them</b> from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Japanese {{maintained}} separate {{army and}} navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated {{with each other}} but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka. Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army, consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's XVIII Army in New Guinea, and the 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul. As {{a result of the}} destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae, but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> forward to Lae by barge or submarine. In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} from injury {{in time for}} the start of the 2001–02 season and once again he became an established member of the team during the start of the campaign. He was dropped from the side for a period of time following an FA Cup defeat to Northampton Town in November 2001, during which he missed an open goal. He returned to the first team in January 2002 and scored on his second game back in the starting eleven as Torquay defeated Bristol Rovers. Two months later, he scored a vital goal in a 2–0 victory over Lincoln City, which helped Torquay to only their second home victory in four months and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> 13points clear of the relegation zone. Torquay finished the season only two places higher than their previous campaign, but 15points above relegated Halifax Town. During his disrupted three seasons with Torquay, Brandon amassed 83appearances with ten goals to his credit, before he moved to Chesterfield in July 2002 on a free transfer.|$|E

50|$|The Hasinai groups {{continued}} {{to live in the}} Neches and Angelina River valleys up to the 1830s, but by the early 1840s, all Caddo groups had moved to the Brazos River area in an effort to avoid Anglo-American colonization. In 1855 the U.S. government <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to the Brazos Indian Reservation, and in 1859 <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to the Washita River in Indian Territory, now western Oklahoma. The Caddo still live in western Oklahoma, Binger, Oklahoma being the capital of Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.|$|R
5|$|Operating near Taegu {{during the}} Battle of Taegu, {{elements}} of the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were surrounded by North Korean troops crossing the Naktong River at Hill 303. Most of the U.S. troops were able to escape but one platoon of mortar operators misidentified North Korean troops as South Korean army reinforcements and was captured. North Korean troops held the Americans on the hill and initially tried to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> across the river {{and out of the}} battle, but they were unable to do so because of heavy counterattack. American forces eventually broke the North Korean advance, routing the force. As the North Koreans began to retreat one of their officers ordered the prisoners to be shot so they would not slow the North Koreans down.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> through the water.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E
