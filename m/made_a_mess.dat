[...] They let their die cutter spoil it, which he did most thoroughly... but they tried to retouch it and gee! [...] They <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of it.

500|$|At 22:00 on 6 August, von Funck {{reported}} that his troops were still not concentrated, and {{the commander of}} the 116th Panzer Division [...] "had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of things". In fact, this officer (Gerhard von Schwerin) had been so pessimistic about the operation that he had not even ordered his tank units to take part. This delay disjointed the German attack, but on the German left flank, the SS Panzer troops attacked the positions of the American 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain shortly after midnight. The Germans achieved temporary surprise, as the Ultra documents had arrived at U.S. First Army Headquarters too late to alert the troops to the immediate assault. They briefly captured Mortain but were unable to breach the lines of the 30th Division, as the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Infantry Regiment commanded Hill 314, the dominant feature around Mortain. Although cut off, they were supplied by parachute drops. Of the 700 men who defended the position until 12 August, over 300 were killed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1947, child {{neuropsychiatrist}} Lauretta Bender {{published a}} study on 98 children aged between four and eleven years old who had been treated in {{the previous five years}} with intensive courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These children received ECT daily for a typical course of approximately twenty treatments. This formed part of an experimental trend amongst a cadre of psychiatrists to explore the therapeutic impact of intensive regimes of ECT, which is also known as either regressive ECT or annihilation therapy. In the 1950s Bender abandoned ECT as a therapeutic practice for the treatment of children. In the same decade the results of her published work on the use of ECT in children was discredited after a study showing that the condition of the children so treated had either not improved or deteriorated. Commenting on his experience as part of Bender's therapeutic program, Ted Chabasinski said that, [...] "It really <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of me ... I went from being a shy kid who read a lot to a terrified kid who cried all the time." [...] Following his treatment, he spent ten years as an inmate of Rockland State Hospital, a psychiatric facility now known as the Rockland Psychiatric Center.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come now, father," [...] {{returned}} his son, [...] "don't {{say that the}} others <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of it. We must remember that Winstanley began his building in what we may call total darkness. No other man before him had attempted such a work, so {{that he had no}} predecessor whose good points he might imitate, or whose failures he might avoid. Many a trained engineer might have made a worse mess of it, and, to my mind, it says much for poor Winstanley's capacity, all things considered, that his lighthouse stood so long as the six or seven years of its building. Then as to Rudyerd's one, it was in reality a great success. It stood firm for nigh fifty years, and, but for the fire, might have stood for any number of years to come. It cannot be justly said that he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of it. As well might you say that the builders of a first-rate ship <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of it because someone set her alight after she had sailed the ocean for half a century." ...|$|E

I haven't a doubt left in the world now. We've got to leave {{everything}} rather than leave each other. I'm sure of it. Now we have gone so far.
