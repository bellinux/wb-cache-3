5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|Phineas is {{also very}} modest. He tends to put Ferb's name on inventions. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E

5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E

5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{has been}} the site of {{extensive}} archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76shrines, 4adze manufacturing workshops, 3other markers, 1positively identified burial site, and 4possible burial sites. By 2009, {{the total number of}} identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they were reserved for burial.|$|E

5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> {{he was a child}} of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are battered and blurry. One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E

5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx was {{the first}} fossil found that {{revealed}} a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a transitional fossil, in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus. Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning, northeastern China, {{which was part of}} an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.|$|E
